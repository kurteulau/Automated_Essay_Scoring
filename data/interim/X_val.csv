1242,5FFB959ED7BA,"I agree.

I agree with this statement, because I have impressions that I can't change in my mind. For example when my mom surprise me with my Play Station.

This Statement is based on my experiences, my first reason why i choose this was because the impressions is impossible to change,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              "
453,222D14189E1F,"Imagine that the school plans to add more time at school. I disagree of the schools adding more time because it would be irritating,boring,stressed. and kids do not want that to happen. The children wants to have a normal school day. And they have to prove that they can do it,they believe in their self.

First,It is boring because they want to have fun. And the reason why it is a lot of fun because they want to have a good time. And thet can think about what they want,What do they want to do when the schools are thjnking about staying more longer at school. For example, Generic_Name went outside to play after school.

Secondly,it is stressing because they would be crazy about it. And the reason why it is stressing because the blood of the brian would get bad. It would be horrible that they have blood pressure,haert attacks,and they want to kill there self. They can't do that,but they can protect there self. For example,Generic_Name was taking a test but she got nervous,Frustrated,lonly and upset.

Thirdly,it is irritating because kids will get tired and dizzy at school. the reason why it's because their body do not have enough energy. For example,My best friend

Generic_Name studied for a test,but she got tired. In my opinion it is not ok that a lot of people get injured. And it is going to be difficult but it is worth a try,I want a lot of people to be happy,not injured,not feeling down and feel better about whats going on,or what is doing.

In closing,I disagree that the school plans to add more time at school. And it is a bad idea,It would get irritating,boring and stressed. In my opinion it is better for kids so they can not worried about it. And it would be easier step by step and keep going,Dont stop doing it.

I really think that it would be better if the school would not have bullies,bad teachers back in the day because a lot of teachers back in the they hit children because sometimes kids do not behave and teachers think that the kids deserved it and i think that The kids do not always get the right answer but In my opinion all teachers are different because some teachers are nice,hardworking,sweet,mean,not inappropiate aswell. And The teachers that i had or have from kindergarden to first grade,second grade,third grade,fourth grade,fifith grade,sixth grade,Seventh grade and 8th grade they're nice,helpful,caring too and thay dont hit us. They protect us,And i want for other kids have the same exciperence that i have. And i want other kids or other people or everybody to be happy and protected too. "
2487,B8F0ECC9DC86,"Dear : Principal

I think that would be a great idea if the you let the student to do community service , because if they do that the street were clean, they go to put more attention helping others person . i mean i know other person doesn't like to clean but i know that we cant make the other people to change ,ho know if they start helping us to like not throwing the trash on the streets. it's not necessary clean the hold day but like 3h that would be great. i know we cant do that i only need to know if you agree or disagree with me. EX: painting the sidewalk cleaning the beaches cleaning the street school helping people that really need are help like paralytic, oldest, veterans persons."
536,2909EE180A2A,"Dear Principal,

I think it fair that kids who have a B average should choose a sport but kids how have F. Should not be able to choose a sport because then they worried more about there sport. Then about school or school work then they don't have time to do there homework. Then they might even fail the grade there in. But people who have a B should be able to choose a sport because there doing well in school. And not failing in school there tried hard so they should be able to choose a sport that they like. But if they start doing bad in school or not doing there homework and start to get an F they should talk to the student. And tell him/her if they have a sport and still have B average or in the next test they take and get an F. there going to have take away there sport till she /he has better grades."
566,2B621C2F0716,"Someone who shares wisdom is like talking to an angle.

One person who shares wisdom to me is my friend because, we love each other, we care about each other, and just giving out wisdom, is just nice.

My friend gives me wisdom cause they love me and wish for the best for me. My friend always tells me that I should always go forward and don't look back, to the bad thing and keep on going. If i'm going through some bad stuff with someone or something you just got to stay positive and just not give up on your self.

Friends give out wisdom because it is nice and helpful for people, my friend like to give out advice and say good things and give out wisdom, because they are nice, and are caring friends and just keep there heads forward not back.

My friends give out wisdom because they care about me and for other people to and not for just one person but for multiple people. My friends are just nice and just some good friends to me and to other people out there in that world, because with wisdom you can give advise to people.

I have learned from other people because i have seen people go through it and thats a happy thing because you give out advise to someone you look forward to, like your parents, aunt, uncle, and the people you trust like a close friend to.

1969,950729DE3582,"Duke Ellington was a jazz legend of his time. One quote he said,"" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I will explain the meaning behind this. And if i agree with this or disagree. Let's begin on the meaning first.

The meaning that he is saying is that form your problem you can make it better for your self. To see your problem you can teach your self to do better. That not to give up on your problem. That something bad can turn good. This quote is trying to modevant you.

I agree with this statement. Something bad will in fact turn something good. Not all bad thing will turn bad

As long as you can make them turn out good. You just have to see a chance to do so. Duke Ellington also may of had the same problem.

Duke Ellington was a great jazz ,but was also so a great person. That something bad that can turn to something that is good is very modevation. I agree with this very much. This is what it means and my opinion on the statement.                                    "
3753,F98FEC21D9EA,"Should School Extend Two More Hours To The Normal Schedule?

One topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. Some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. They feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. In my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: I can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week.

Once, I was pretty nervous about my Earth Science SOL test, I did not know what to do to pass it because I never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and I felt worried because I did not understand some topics, and I only had one week to learn everything, so I decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing I realized that I had learned what I needed to learn and I felt ready to take my SOL and finally, I passed it. Now I know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester.

Sadly, I am a Senior, and this is my last year in High School, and that means that maybe, I will not see some friends and teachers again, so I am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and I think that spending at least 25 more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from High School.

As some students, I do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, I work for a moving and storage company, and that means that I can only work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays because I come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at 7:00 am when I am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because I would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that I might need.

As you have read, I am agree about extend the school day two more hours. Only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to understand about their classes, and people who takes advantage of at least one day free per week."
1005,4D3C1E2D2E03,"I agree with Churchill's to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm, it that's matter if you are failure and you are not even losing your enthusiasm but at list you try, that is the most important thing.

First of all,

you will never know everything but the most important things is trying because if you dont try, you will never learn, but sometime its okay to be failure without a enthusiasm that means that you dont care, you are not interesting in anything or another way to see that dont have a enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if i feel like i am just losing every time and i dont even has a enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be try to increase.

Secondly, some time people love to be a better person but there will be people who doesnt enjoy the time to increase, I just know one thing for sure sometime people like to stay in the same step because if you want to be a winner, you must try and see what you can do to go up, I will try to have a good future, a better future for my family, to have my own things, living failure make you a weak person everyone can see that you are weak, that you are not smart enough , that you are comfortable for what you have, but you must be a ambition person to have more than what you have.

Thirdly, if you dont want to live failure you must to win the opportunity, I just know that this world is for smartest people, here survive the person who can use there brain carefully, people who are not making bad mistake but we are humans,m humans make mistake but that is okay you must fix it you must to increase yourself to keep something in your heart that can motivate yourself.

Concluion, on my opinion i can said its okay if you want to stay in the same step,but you will never understand the meaning of life if you never try, you shoul try at least one time."
2946,D3B45F8759E3,"Have ever thought a problem can take you to do your best. knowing that you made a mistake or have a problem come to you can eather ruin your plans or take you to do the best. Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"". A problem can present in any ocattion but is inportant for you to not give up to keep trying and to make that problem a new chance were you can try something new.

Being able to show your solving a skill can also help you in any ocattion. If you are able to show that you can solve anything and take risk to solve tha problem that can be an inportant step for you to take and try to flip that problem to something good . Show your skill show that you can keep trying and try your best to solve that problem wich can take a long time to do but by showing things can also help you in your future.

studys show that solving a problem can increase your brain knowledge imagene if in stead of solving a problem you can flip it into a good thing, and also help in the future. a problem can come from diffirent situation and from different topics which can help increase your knowlegde in that certain topic what happens if you try something new and it fails that can also can make you or can break you. it can break you in the form that you stop tryingand give up or it cna make you if you dont let that problem take control of you and you take your time to solve it or turn it into chance.

do your best to solve that problem or take that chance or turn it into a lelarning process that you know you try ur best and you know you took your time to solve that problem and you can have that expirience in your mind and you know you learn a lot from thatt chance that was once a problem but knowing is a learning expirience. All that you learn can help you in the future. and I agree with what duke ellington said a problem can be a chnce of learning.

making a mistake or having a problem fail can teach you a lot of thing were you can learn from your failing expirience it can sometimes ruin your expirience but at the end of the day you learn from that mistake. That problem can present in any ocattion or time. having the powers to turn that problem into a chance of learning."
3662,F5E70573B058,"The prompt talk about who people have own instincts and ideas or to make their own decisions. People make decisions in their own life. Nobody have to tell them what to do in their life. He or her can follow their own instincts or idea. Everyone should make own choice or own decisions in their life. Their life is so important to them that they could make own decisions without people tell what to do or ruin their life. People should be wrong about their life not other people life. If they want to help they should talk with the people if want help or not. I know everyone want to help out but sometime they don't want help for other people,friends or their family. They could solve their problem at there own.

For example we don't need people to tell other people how to live their life. They can make their decisions. They a lot people that make bad decision or good decisions in their life. It good that they did bad choice because they real what they did and they won't do it again in their life. People can live their life but they have to make good choice their life not bad choice. They should have good friends that make good decision in their that always help them in their life. If you have a friend that make bad decision sometime at friends won't help you out. Then you are on your own with you're problem. Sometime good to hang out with friends but you have to make good choice if you're going to hang out with your friend's.

I know people can make own decision and can help other people to not make bad choice in life. Is good you got friends and family that have your back when you want to make own decisions in your own life. Sometime family don't agree with your choice or decision you want to make. You're life is important you should make good choice in you're life to happy or live your life with you're family's and friends. You don't have to wrong about other people opinion. Sometime good to listing to other people opinion if it will help you understand your problem or to make good decision or not. Some people don't want help for other people. They don't want other people to be wrong about their life or be noise. The only who makes decision are the adults or the teenager but not the kid's. It's great that teenager are make decision in their life. Teenager sometime make bad choice when they are with their friends hang out. They learn the lesson to don't make bad choice in their life or to not hang out with their friends. "

I think the author waldo Emerson wrote he reference about like what you doing alone in one world if you care the world o destroy de world if u can alone or need support the people."
1478,7248792ECAC9,"Many people believe that success consists of going from failure. because we all human making mistake in our life. being faliure is good for must of peoples. however we all taking lesson from faliure to faliure to be come success in our life. for many resons: fristly,must of students, agree with this statement that Minister Winston Churchill once said. and secondary, part of students did not believe in this statement. however they are thanking we do not want to failure in our life or tests. we want to success once time. previosly must of people agree failure is key is success.

for example: Abraham Lincoln, one of the 16th president of the U.S, once time said in during in civil war said to his people or audience, we have to be strong, does not matter for us how hard is life is it . and he continue his speech he said. whatever success, going from failure to faliure without loos any of enthusiasm. he said never contrition in your past. the constant to be succsess consists of going from failure. and aslo he siad that, this a good convenience for everone in consequence Lincoln, said you guys have to conscious and be awake all the time. this confirm to everyone or to all of us key of failure is in success.

other peoples , did not agree what Abraham Lincoln said. must of them said this is not compulsion or compulsory, they said this is over las conclusive in our decide we want to success one time without lossing any enthusiasm or failure.

In my opinion that "" succcess consists of going from failure to failure without loos of enthusiasm. we agree in this prompt. because before that i said faliure of key is becoming in success in our life we should all battle with failure we all know that way is become austerity. we have to fight with failure we did not want to win us. we want to success,in improve our self.

Many people making a mistake in thier life some of them success, and most of them failure. this is our life.

no mather success congsists of going from failure to faliure. some people dismal when they got failure in thier life.

They are become depression most of them and finally when they got success in thier life they are become happy, and depreciation. of course that"" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."
2959,D45494CE3D2E,"Human survival depends on technology, we can not live without it. Technology is used in our everyday lives, from the very moment we open our eyes to the end of the day when we go into our sleep. Technology has really advanced a whole lot in comparison from the first telephone made up, to todays modern devices. Technology may have a negative impact to it, since technology is everywhere it is almost impossible to keep out of reach. Young children start to us it to early in life, they get addicted and they cry if it is taken from them. Technology may have that negative affect but it has many positive affects that come from it as well.

The beginning of technology all starts back when the first telephone was created by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone he had created is much different from the ones you see today in everyday use by millions of people. His creation of the telephone was like a brick, very big and heavy. That device was more of a at home used only kind of device, not something you could easily just carry around with you. his invention probably was not the most popular right away since everyone was so use to living with out one it was not much of a necessity. As time progressed other inventors took Graham bells invention and invested further into it, adding and taking away things it had. For one the size and weight of it was changed by a lot through out time as well as the capability of what you could do on it. At first it was used only to transfer calls to communicate with somebody verbally without having to be face to face or even at close distance with them. Many individuals wanted to be the inventor of a phone and there are more than one, therefore because of this there are different companies, not just one that produces electronic devices. Around the early 2000's Apple, which is one of the biggest electronic device companies had released the first Iphone. Everyone and everywhere all around the world people were purchasing Apples new product. Throughout the years Apple has made so many products for people to purchase from cell phones,earphone, tablets, computers, watches, portable chargers, to just about anything for people to buy that they may use in there everyday lives.

Though all these advancements in technology may have caused some negative impacts in life such as that children from a young age get addicted from them it has also helped them. Parents have a big impacts in this whether they decide to hand their children a electronic or not, most parents that do let them opporate a device usually have limitations in what they can do or watch and for how long. Letting young children use this technology isnt all bad, there are television shows that help them learn their shapes, colors, objects, movements and simply learn how to communicate with others before entering school, nothing wrong with being a little ahead of others. ABC mouse is one of many great resources online that help children with their education and it is also done in a fun way for them to learn and enjoy their studying.

Technology is used by everyone all around the world and even out in space! Everything around us is being technologically used by us, inside of our own homes and outside. Security cameras, the thermostat that keeps us warm in the comfort of our homes and AC that helps us cool down on hot sunny days, the foods and drinks we store away in our fridges and freezers, WiFi box, T.V(s), door bells, all of that technology and thats just in our homes. Outside everyday technology would be like he vehicle we use to get to our jobs, the traffic signals, GPS to help guide use to get to our desired destination. You have a paper due or something you really need information on whether it is school related or not and the library is closed or you just can not get in reach of one you can simply do your research from any location you may be in with a click and swipe on a screen like your cell phone or computer. Machines are technology used like those in hospitals that are seriously used for human survival when someone is terribly injured or a new baby is born. Technology is still progressing and it will only become more advanced through out time, everyday inventors and scientist use it to make new ways to cure up diseases, find out where they come from and how they can be prevented.

The creation of technology on our world has been very helpful to us all in every way possible, without it there are many possibilities of certain deaths and accidents that could have occurred if it did not exist. The amount of advancement that it had gotten to will only help it get greater so we can be prepared for future tragedies that we would not want this world to face. Technology has been an extremely positive thing that has happened in this world for millions possibly even billions of people who use it.             "
3335,E71EFBE547CF,"Everyone has a talent or skill. Everyone can do anything, Imagine going to America's got talent and seeing people's talents and skills. I am identifying a talent or skill I have, and explaining how i develop and use it.

To begin with my talent, my talent is roaring like a lion, is like a deep voice and just pushing air in my throat. My other talent is hoola-hooping with my arms, just making circles with my arms for the movement of the hoola-hoop. My final talent is drawing, i enjoy drawing because i can draw what i'm feeling but i need to be more detailed.

Next my skill, my skill is swimming fast, I only use my arms and legs for more movement and i would need a lot of energy for it. My other skill is running fast, I use my legs and ball up my fist for more movement. My final skill is holding my breathe long, it's risky but I would beat my friend's scores.

Finally both of my skill and talent, my favorite talent is roaring because I would scare my friends and it's funny. My favorite skill is swimming fast because I can possibly beat anyone's scores. My least favorite talent is hoola-hooping with my arms because it's not really impressive anymore.

In conclusion, now I believe that everyone has a talent and skill. Don't be afraid to share your talent, embrace it and share it to the world. I am identifying a skill i have using specific details and examples."
3641,F52394B3500C,"I think that school should not follow the business model. Adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. There are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. Staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself I need go home after I am done with school because I have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house I have to do that every day after I get out from 0school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school.

I think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. For example student can not afford to stay on school for 10 straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. Also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours I think that they are going to be really tired for work I have some friends they start working at 5pm they get out of 3pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at 5pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. Another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself I have to go home early to take care of my house I have to care of my house quickly so I can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after I get out from school.

Of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. There are some student whom does not do anything after they get out from school so for them it does not really matter whether they have o stay two more hours or they does not have to stay like my friend Generic_Name he is a student who does not do any actives or their go to work after school so for him it does not matter if have to stay two more hours. Having two more hours means that those student whom does not do anything after school can have more time con do their school work as well study more for their test. The benefit of adding two more hours only benefits those who does not do anything after school.

In conclusion trying to follow the businesses model is not good idea for our school, so many student are going to arguing for it they are going be saying that just by trying to save a little bit of energy and resources they have to change so many things and sacrifice their money and their time in fact is not a big different adding two more hours two the schedule every day because that means that we till have to use energy in those hours."
45,03D00899C901,"I think yes, that if you have a positive attitude it is a key to success why do i think that?

I think that If you have a positive attitude you wont get in trouble because the attitude that you give out is the way that people judge you, A positive attitude is a great way to get the things you want in life like for example, If you want to get a job or a career you have to have a good and positive attitude because if not then they will not accept you like for another example if you have a positive attitude you can make friends and people will like you because of the way you are if your kind people will be like ""wow this person is so nice and kind"" i just think that being kind and nice is the best way to be in life you dont really get in trouble because your attitudes nice and not rude and about things that people tell you or want you to do in the other hand if your rude and people people will look and you and think about you in a rude way and not like you. The reasons I feel like a positive attitude is good because i am a kind person and dont get in to trouble with none because there is no reason to be mad and angry about small stuff. I fell like other people might think different about what I think because we all think different about everything. If you go to a friends house and you be all mean and rude and all dirty people are not going to like you because of the way you are and the other hand if you are all nice people they will like you because of how you are you and that you have respect of how your attitude is if not then you will not be wanted by people because of you act and are and people who act all rude end up in places they never thought they would end up in i just saying just stay with a positive attitude in the world and you will succeed in life and be great and not have to go through stuff like get in to fights or locked up in jail. I meant i know some people that have bad attitude and life and they are doing great in life but there is going to be one day that you will get in a problem by the way you act i think that just stay with a positive attitude so you dont got to worry about anythings and that its just better way to get al the things you need and would like to active in life because why be all rude when you can just be sweet and caring then be all grumpy and mad about small little things that can be fixed because thats what I think but if you have a bad attitude you might like end up saying or doing something that you will regret like if your like taking and with a attitude you might end up saying stuff that you dont mean and if your normal and calm about stuff you dont go to worry about nothing. I also been told that if your have a great attitude you wont have to worry about stuff because why would someone care about how you are if your all nice and not rude."

I Prefer to be Myself and be happy Then, Pretend to be someone else just to make people like me,

people will like me for the way i am and not for who I'm Pretending to be so that I dont have to waste my time hanging out with fake friends.

I know people that are a shame of where they came from and they started forgetting their culture and start adopting a new one. every time someone ask them about their past they just look a way and try not to answer because they dont one the rest of the people to know how they use to live and now that they have everything they wanted they act like they were never there.

theres people that pretend to have lots of cars,money and houses just to look superior than others that just messed up i dont see the point of making others feel bad just to make you feel superior thats just stupid why do you pretend to be someone that you are not even close to?

thats messed up i seen this happen a lot of times in my life and it makes me feel sad.

That is all have to said i hope that one Day this society will change their point of view and accept all the mistakes they had done."
2060,9B42B1750AD8,I don't think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their family's. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that don't play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service. People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week. The principals should make the people who act bad during the week and during the weekend that will probably help them change a lot they gonna get tired of picking up litter and doing community service.
520,27B8304D6E89,"we should perform community service because we are helping our society to become much cleaner. for examples i can give are, help janitors to clean litter from school, help the teachers by tutoring kids, go to the library to help clean and organize it so i could look perfect when kids come to the library, and to go to the hospitals to help patients, and so we can help clean the hospital. That's why i think we all should perform community service."
2527,BB8A59BA8C61,"I disagree that first impressions are impossible to change because, at first they could be shy, there personality could change, and they can come off rude in the beginning.

The first time ever meeting you they can just be shy because there getting to know you. That's how some people work. It happens a lot in the work area. When I first went to work for my first day I was really shy and didn't talk to anybody, but now that i've been working there for 3 months and i've gotten so much comfortable with everyone there.

Once you have gotten to know the person there personality changes thought out your friendship. It makes you think who you probably met in the beginning. Sometimes they could just be lying to you just to see if your a good friend or just to make them sound better about them selves.

When you first meet someone they can for sure come off rude but then after you get to know them its like there another person. Thats how I really am, I just come off as a really mean person.

You could bump into someone and th ey probably get mad and start talking to you so rude. You'll never know they could become your best friend.

In conclusion, a first impression is possible to change because they might come off shy at first, They could change thought out the friendship, and they could come off rude at first. "
2655,C47E98E69AFB,"I'm a gree because if we are enthusiasm is probavility that we have success in the future for example, when we take an test if we are bored and also we not are enthusiasm is probavility that we fail and no passing the test, sometime be enthusiasm is the first step to take the success,but sometime when we are enthusiasm also is probavility that we can loss to most but there is when we need to be most enthusiasm because is like it how we can have success.

actually,

another example It's me because when my family and I decide that I will to come to United Stated and my other family that live in the United stated for many years they told me that if I coming I will going to the school I was feeling enthusiasm because I wanted to learn a new language a was the English and now I have three years living and studing here and for be enthusiasm today I speaking two languages

I think for be enthusiasm I have success for this reason I'm agree the success consist in no be scary to loss and alway be enthusiasm.

Also many peoples said that the success not consist in be enthusiasm because they said manytimes the peoples that are enthusiasm like for example, when they will stard a business or differents type of jobs they loss money for example or also they always fail in everything and the reason is because they are very enthusiasm for this rasson they said that be enthusiasm not always is good and also not a;ways consist in the success.

but is a opinion because there are many people that are agree and other are desagree because some people take a good opportunities because they said that they was very entusiasm and also there are people that never know what is success for this reason are desagree but in my situation

I was enthhusiasm and this support my success.

615,2EA9DA7AAD2C,"Thomas Jefferson said ""determine never to be idle."" What he means is that people should not just sit there and do nothing for their whole life because it won't help them accomplish their goals. Some people say doing something serves a purpose. Others say that inactivity also serves a purpose. Doing nothing at all is a bad choice. The best option to serve a purpose is to actually do something by helping others and the world then staying idle and not doing anything to help others.

First, the reason why Thomas Jefferson said that people should never be idle is because he wants to change their lives forever. Another reason why people should take this advantage is that if people don't do any activities in their life, then they won't be able to achieve their goals in the future. Most people will say this, ""doing something serves a purpose because it could help other people get their work done."" It's good to start doing activities at a younger age because they will be able to experience it and get used to it later on. Also, doing activities can help them gain more respect and they could get famous. It could be too late to start doing activities when they are older, but people just have to think of what they are going to do to fix it.

Next, most people will say that they don't know what activity they should do. For example, i didn't want to do any activites like other people did so i went and did karate for 4 years. A year later I started to swim every Saturday and eventually I have been getting better. After that I started to go to the gym from Monday through Thursday every single week. It's not too late to start an activity at a younger age, but for an older age it could be. The people just got to work hard if they want to achieve their goal, but the only way they could do it is if they can believe that they can do this.

In addition, other people think that not doing any activity serves a purpose. They say that because they think their parents do most of the work so they don't have to do any of it. Also, there are people who are just lazy and don't care about their life. Others think that doing activities doesn't really achieve their goal in the future. Most people just don't know what they want to do in life.

Lastly, Thomas Jefferson doesn't want people to be idle for their whole life because he wants to help them do activities that they think its interesting. Another reason why people should take an advantage of this, so when they are young, they will understand of what is gonna happen in their future, and then as they get older, they will have full potential by doing it. Also, it will help them and other people get the job done. They will not have to struggle in their future. The thing about activities is to never give up, even if they mess up its ok, they just need to practice and practice nonstop."

1042,4F98619F7A18,"People go through good things in life and bad things but when it comes to success everyone gets happy about it even thorough the bad times.

First, when having a positive attitude you think more. It opens up your creativity makes you a critical and creative thinker. It helps you think about positive things and not negative things. When your at a difficult moment and you have a positive attitude it motivates you to keep going and not to give up.

Next time your In a difficult moment try to have a positive attitude it will help you through those hard times and it will motivate you not to give up.

Secondly, when I was in 7th grade my friend was taking a very important test. The test was about 35 questions and I remember he was worried that he wasn't going to pass it. He started to tell me ''what happens if I don't pass it my parent's are going to get so mad at me''. He also told me ''I'm not going to pass this test''. What I told him was ''don't worry about it do your best and you got this just have a positive attitude''. Then I went to the bathroom and once I came back I saw him jumping around and happy. Once I got inside the classroom I said ''what happened I said'' he said ''I passed the test''. I got so happy that just by having a positive attitude great things can happen to you.

Thirdly, It doesn't matter where you are weather your in a airplane or even in Mexico having a great attitude can change so much. It can even change you and your life. I once said to myself having a great a positive attitude means having a great day. When your at a difficult moment in your life or just anytime. You feel stuck of sad and you feel like you want to give up be positive and say to your self you got this I can do it. One benefit of having great attitude is it motivates you to be successful and to not give up.

668,33DEFCDAD05F,"Technology has made a positive impact in our lives. Technology can be used for many things whether it's browsing the web, shopping, or planning for vacation. Technology has had impacted us negative wise and positive wise. For a lot of people they see technology as a huge positive impact for people.

People may think now that technology is out people contact other people way less but high chance that's not the case. People that do things like gaming or just connection with others online make it way easier to meet other people. For example theres websites like Omegle where you just go on and get into a voice chat with a random person around the country or maybe in other countries. There's also many other websites or apps where you can contact random people or even friends and family. There's also gaming, for gamers you usually go into lobbies or servers with thousands of people which is also an easier to contact people. For example if you own a PC, a PlayStation, or even an Xbox there's many games where you can contact people if you're making new friends or even just playing with them for as long until someone gets off. I have heard many stories where people have met online and grew a friendship even though they've never met in person they probably have each other's social media and numbers.

Many people use technology to shop. Online shopping is an easier way of finding things you need or even things you want. People commonly do online shopping only because it's just easier and quicker. Some people may have a busy schedule so it will make things easier if they're running errands or even just going out and spending time with family or friends without having to add something else to their list of plans. Online shopping is probably something everyone has done multiple times and many people can agree that it is easier and quicker than driving out to the store and searching through the whole store to find the things you want or need.

In conclusion of this technology has made a positive impact in our lives in many things that people do on a daily basis. Technology could be seen as positive or negative depending on how people see it but in my eyes it's done a good job and has definitely made things easier for a lot of people."
3043,D95B78E39793,"It is 21st century people have their own opinion and decisions. Human revolutionary has changed drastically over the time. People now are smart and makes wise decisions on their daily basis. However, people tend to take risk upon their decisions without any consultancy with experts and authorities.

People should always seek guidance from experts and authorities whenever they are making any big decisions. It will be more easier for them to choose options when they seek guidance from someone who already knows about it. People often tend to make wrong decisions when they make decisions by themselves. A lot of celebrities have their personal guidance which is their manager. Manager makes a thoughtful decisions for celebrities to keep them on track of their career. If celebrities tend to make their own decisions many celebrities would go downfall in their career.

The decisions people make should be thoughtful and have guidance from experts. Christopher from into the wild book, he is one of the example for to take advise from experts or else people will end up like Chris. Christopher did not take any guidance from anyone while going into the wild of Alaska alone. He did not have any good materials to take with and didn't ask for help. MC candles died into the wild of Alaska because he was not prepared for the trip he was going into. This is exactly why people should take advise, if he would have taken any advice what so ever he would most likely have survived in the Alaska wilderness. He chose not to take any guidance which is the reason he died into the wilderness.

Everyone wants to have a successful life but not everyone gets it. If people wants to have a success in their life they have make right decisions or seeking the guidance from experts. There are only few people who people who succeeded in their career while making their own decisions even if they succeeded on their own they will need a manager to keep on track of their career. Person who seeks lot of advises from experts and authorities tend to be on advantages on their business. It will be more reliable to make a big decisions while seeking advice from expert rather than making it all alone. People are more likely to take a wrong decisions while doing it alone.

Overall, everyone should seek guidance from experts and authorities while making the decisions. It will be always more beneficial to have a advise while making big decisions in life or else people will end up like Christopher from into the wild.        "
408,1F217579A773,"Imagine if you go to school for more than eight hours? When I was in my country we were going to school at twelve and we were dismiss at five afternoon. I disagree that school should be more than eight hours because teachers can not manage their time, all staff will get tired, and some student have to take care of their family.

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he won't be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy?

All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired.

Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that. However, when I was in my country I was responsible about my nephews as well.

Some say extending school hours is hopeful for student. They are wrong because some student don't like school so they will drop out. Some say student will have finish the school early. They are wrong student will be rushing and not able to get the lesson from first time.

Positives. Negatives. In conclusion, I hope that Generic_Name disagree this decision because student like to have fun more than studying. Also I hope all states of America will disagree on this decision.

998,4C6B05BD5A81,"Over ten precent of the students say that they would rather go to school instead of staying home. It would benefit the students learning abilites because some teachers will teach differently then other teachers. It is so much easier learning at school because the teachers at school know what the students needs to learn. The students needs someone who knows how to teach and has been teaching for a while. If the students pick online learnig the teachers can be fake a pretend to teach the kids when they do not know anything. The video conferencing can get messed up by the internet because some people might have slow connection or no connection at all.

It would be easier for students because they will learn more at school then the video chat, or from online. Some students have a slower learning abilities then others. The students are learning by one teacher from the video chat some students will be done much quicker then the other students. At school th teachers wait for the other students finish then they let the rest of class to do other work. It will not help the students to learn from home because at home is where they have their games tv all of that stuff they will pretend to be doing work, but actually they will be doing other adn stuff and they will tell the teachers that they already finished the work.

Students needs someone who has a degree in teaching. It will be easier for the teachers because they will know what things they have to teach to the certain type of students. They would know how to teach it to them and it will be easier for them to learn the topic. It is easier to go to school becuase we will learn the topic with other students and students can ask for help from their friends or the the teachers in class.

The teachers on video chat can be a random person off the streets and teach the student the wrong infomation. Also it will cost a lot of money for the students learn from a video chat. Schools are free, so the students can go there and get education for free, nor the students, or parents have to pay. Some parents, nor students can afford online classes because it costs like over one hundred dollars.

Staying home and doing online classes is fun because we are able to stay in our night clothes and do school work. Students can get their blankets and anything they want and do work while being comfortable. The students do not have to get up and go to school. They can get up at anytime and do class work. As fun as that sounds some students will not be able to meet their friends because their friends might have a different sechdules then their other friends. They will have to do work wilhile they want to meet up.

Students should not do online classes because it will intefere with their other stuff like hanging out with friends and going to work. They will miss out on parties that their friends will host for them. It help the students and the teachers because not everyone has a good ability like the other students. "

I sopport the student should be attend class from home because We do not have to go to School and we can have more time with the family also We do not have to wake up early we can saty safe at home.

SD 1. some student do not like to wake up early and they shoose to take the classes online for the reason that student do not to ride the bus and can early to School.

SD 2. In my opinio it is a good idea to take class online most in this time becacuse so many bad thing are happen in the world for Example the corona virus this is one of most reason that I support to attend class at home because We can do the classes online and we can stay at home more safe and healthy.

SD 3. other good reason that is a good idea to take classes in home is that you mom know that you are in home because a lot of students scape and they mom thing that they are inthe School so if peolple attend classes from home mom ready know the his son in home.

conclution some student do not like to use the computer and they shoose to come to School and other student they do not how to use computer but still doing a good idea tke classes at home becasue you can have more time with your family also you don't have to wake up early to ride the bus and you can do you work at home and take more break"
1577,78B6F383CD30,"So many students need to finish the school more early than others, it's a good think the student finish high school in three years, they have more opportunities for study wherever they like. Although some students will don't want graduate early because they are not ready to being a university life or alone life, nevertheless for others students is a good choice being her life or overtake her life, for example they have more opportunities for study a long profession like Doctor, students will have more time to doing think they like as to travel, and if they want can make a family.

Students make a complied because they want to study a long profession and they don't have some many time to doing all thing they want. The students said normally the people finish high school between the 17 or 18 and they know are young, but some time they need a break before to enter the college and if one student want to study a long profession he or she don't have so many time to take a break and study a profession like a doctor than is during like

5 or 6 years. This significant than student need more time to doing one thing fun before to enter the college. Additionally in the future may be they need another break after the finish college I opportunity the young people like travel too much and know others countries, they own country, they want watch new things, they know different s people, different language, different accent or pass free time with her family, friend, or play any sports. This is important because although they have time when they graduate at 18 or 19. Maybe if they finish high school when they have 16 have more time to graduate the college early and doing so many thing they like to do.

Another students want finish early high school to do others things so different like make a family and find a good job they like so much. So many adolescences think in money since so young , they need money, money for buy some material thing like a car, an apartment, so many clothes so expensive. This is important because the adolescences think finish most early high school is like they said "" if I graduate the high school a the 16 then a began to work like than i will have 21 i have all the thing I need for begin an alone life, then will want to married get a big family.

In conclusion, the this a good program of some schools than students can graduate in three years, sometime students need more time in her life for doing thing they like an the opportunities for choice a some long profession and have time to do thing they like or job for a better life.

2358,AF6E7702012F,"Is doing your best a problem? Personally I feel like there is no problem by doing your best. You should always want to do your best no matter what your doing. But,some people don't like to try they give up so easily that they don't want to do nothing no more. Like me I try my best but,sometimes I don't apply myself,and when I don't apply myself it turns out to bad results.

For Example,Paul George,and the Clippers played against Los Angeles Lakers,during the middle of the game Paul's shots weren't falling so he was having a low scoring game,but he still tried his best to get rebounds and steals to win the game for his team.

For another Example Generic_Name had a test,and there were some questions on there that he didn't understand. so he still worked through the problems,and took an educated guess and still tried his best and got a 75 on the test. usually Generic_Name get a B or above on tests but he forgot that the teacher told him that there would be some questions on the test that the class didn't know.

Final Example,my little sister is a basketball player like me and every Friday i go to ball handling to get my handles right. My little sister never done it before,and the class that we took was advance,it was easy for me because i been doing it for so long. But,i look to my right and i seen my sister struggling and my Trainer told her she was doing it wrong. So she dropped the ball and walked out the gym. After the training we got home,and i had a talk with her,and i told her i was gonna help her out. I showed her the moves outback and she started to get the hang of it,and now she's been practicing on the moves for weeks,and finally uses them in the game. But, she gave up the first time but, she was willing to try,and the results turned out fine because she tried her best.

You should always want to do your best and not give up because if you do your best the turn out would be great. It makes you want to work hard and do better at the things you want to do or get the things that you like. It makes you feel good because you know you tried to give it your all and wouldn't have to stress about it."
1732,8311ABD30CC1,"Many people thinks that the school should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesn't have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours.

Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours.

For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Extending school for two hours, will cause that fathers will get a bad attitude, and some students will lost their jobs, sport practice, etc. Students will feel like they can not do it, and their grade will go down. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending school two hours.    "
3670,F6194DEBEFA7,"Teenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart.

The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues.

Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be.

Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.                                                                                          "
895,44DCCF637033,"DEAR PRINCIPAL

All the students should perform community service because the adults are out there working the whole day and when they come back home they want to drive on a clean community. The students when they do community service they are learning about their future life it is like a job you can't slack off. The adults don't have enough time to do community work with their job and all that but who has more free time than the students or kids . That is not all when we clean up our community our children our going to live in a clean community so help make a better future. The students may this is corny but they know too that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors child with home work and any thing out side your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids too that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class.

There would be like when a student gets suspended they have do community work and give him or her an hour or more time .

So principal encourage more students to do community service during the day or after school."
3036,D939E8851FAE,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because, you're getting people's opinions and their way of handling a situation people can give you advice that you wouldn't have thought about before and that will help your choice in many ways. Some peoples opinions can support your choice or can go against your choice. Getting other people's opinion can help someone think of a better choice and make that choice more helpful to that someone.

Why getting other people's opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording. Having different opinions can make someone think of a better choice because people give that someone ideas of the choice they're going to make. Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someone's choice more beneficial and help someone's way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldn't really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldn't be that make someone think of a better choice. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice.

Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someone's choice and make better choices. Having two or one opinion doesn't persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldn't really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she can't just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices. Having advice from close ones can be helpful to because they can persuade someone to make choice that will benefit their life and ensure that they will not regret that choice they made in the future.

That's why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, they help people think of better choice and new ones to, they can persuade people to make better choices, having more opinions can benefit their choice, having more opinions can make someone's choice more beneficial, having more opinions can give someone ideas. That's why having multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice."
2949,D3F44CC7EC17,"Do you think that people can be influence with your own example? or do you think that they need more than that. Although some say that giving your own example is the best way to influence others because you are giving a real example so people will trust you more , actually there are better ways to do it because if you give more than one example people is going to trust you more and you can make a plant for take their attention.

people can be convinced by looking at other people`s example because they think that doing what others do is better.

In my opinion we should give more than one example to the people because one can not be enough for people who do not believe what other say, so what we need is more options where they can find their influences. Giving more than one option is giving them a chance to choose them what they can be influence by.

some times we need their attention because that way we can convinced them that we are telling them the true and they will follow us and they will fell comfortable with them self.

in conclusion giving more that a lot of choose to the people is better because they can choose what influence they want Although some say that giving your own example is the best way to influence others because you are giving a real example so people will trust you more , actually there are better ways to do it because if you give more than one example people is going to trust you more and you can make a plant for take their attention."
2886,D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"".

Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didn't like or didn't want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldn't have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they?

Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but won't read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what you're ordering comes with.

Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because they're hurting badly and doctors will say you're perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you don't need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist don't believe in that but most do.

So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes don't know what they're doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others."
955,49096A420708,"It's good to change the school cafeteria food and make it healthier, because most of the students needs to eat healthy to live a longer life, students will preform better in the school activities and students will get in a better shape.

First, having a healthier school lunch in the school cafeteria will give students a healthy long life. They won't have any blood pressure problems. There body will be able to preform better as there brain. For example, if a student eats vegetable he/she will have much more clear blood than a student who eats meat.

Next, foods that are healthier will have a huge impact on students performance. If a student keeps eating unhealthy food they will constantly be tired and will not be able to perform as well as possible, but healthier food helps the students to perform better and get better grades.

Next, the healthier food means a healthier body which leads to looking good and keeps you away from going to doctor as often as a person who eats unhealthy food. Getting in shape doesn't mean working out, you must eat healthy to be in a good shape. Also, Students will not be sick as often which means that they will not need to visit doctors more often.

In conclusion, having healthier food in the school cafeteria is a great idea. Students will be able to perform better, they will live a longer and healthier life and students will be in a good shape so they will not have to visit doctors and pay a lots of money for there body which they can control."
1270,616C3D5795E8,"I think i agree on the Churchill statement because :

every time you failure more and more ,every time you learn something new , for example :

my mom always puts me to clean the house but every time i went to do the cleaning, she used to say ""you din't clean here or ""you are missing a part of the floor that still is dirty"" so i just say to my self next time i'm gonna clean better in this part of the room and i keep smiling not given up.

To learn how to clean the house in a perfect way i decided to clean the house every Saturday so i can practice more , it passed two month and then i went to clean again and i mop the floor , clean the windows , clean all the tables,so i finished and my mom says great job you now know how to clean in a perfect way!!.

remember to success you don""t even have to think about what you do wrong just keep working on it ,and keep dreaming!!!"
758,3A94013B23DD,"""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" a quote from Thomas Jefferson, meaning the more active we are, the more we are able to accomplish. Although many would believe being active would be the obvious answer, there are reasons as to why being inactive may allow us to achieve more. By being inactive, we have plenty of time on our hands to accomplish things, we have the energy to accomplish more, rather than constantly being worked up and doing something, and we also have time to brainstorm ideas.

Constantly doing something does not give us the time we need to accomplish goals. By always have a fixed schedule or always having to do something, we feel as though we connot risk wasting any time by trying to achieve something. Having those few extra minutes out of the day can allow us to create or focus on our hobbies, which then can get us to accomplish things. For example, over the summer, my dad decided to take time out of his job to focus on his love for plants. He then decided to make it his goal to bulid a garden, by taking time out of his very fixed work schedule to do it. By the end on the summer, he had accomplished his goal; just from taking some time off.

Always doing something causes us to lack the energy we need to accomplish things. When constantly doing things and working, we are too tired to achieve anything, because we put all our energy into everthing else we do. We become fatigue and restless when constantly doing something. For example, my mother is always doing something; she goes to class, goes to work, then comes home to clean and cook. She is never able to accomplish anything because she does not have enough energy. When we constantly work, all we want to do after is sleep, rather than causing us to want to accomplish things.

By not always having to do things, we are able to new brainstorm ideas. We can brainstorm goals that we would like to accomplish. When always doing something our minds are focused on other things, rather than focusing on acheiving goals. We dont have time to sit and brainstorm when we are constantly working. Our minds cannot focus on multiple things at once, meaning it does not have space for other thoughts of accomplishments.

Even though many people think that constantly being active helps accomplish more, it is not always true. We can accomplish just as much, or even more when being inactive than always doing something. By being inactive we have the time to accomplish things, we have the energy to achieve more goals, rathan than being tired and restless, and we are able to brainstorm ideas without other thoughts in our minds to distract us."
1363,690713606EEF,"I disagree because students don't only like sport or making year books and student council students also want to try other things like art, music, computers. Students like other things not all students like the same things. There are other things to try out extracurricular activities. I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities.

Like other schools don't have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said their's art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and

Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some don't some students don't like making year books some students don't like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want.

There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students don't only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion.

If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is it's the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities."

However does that believe that is not a good idea that students commit at the young age one reason is that they will file tire , because when they want to pay atention to math class and they see that the teacher is talking to much they are going to say no I want to sleep to to be in this class borring,second when they are in the corridor study for a quiz and they will be talking about the career and when they are going to take the quiz they will know nothing because they did not study .

Does who believe that is a good idea for students to commit a career at the young age give one reason ,one reason is that tey can see can the life is very hard and they will have to do there own thing ,second is that they can buy a car so because if they shoes a good career they are going to resif a lot of money so can have a car and help there family with other thing at home .

Finally that career it have to be good some you are not going to be looking for another commit career because you try hard and ask you family and teacher to help you to fun a good one, second if you like that career you most talk wit you mom or dad that you are happy with that and tell you teacher that help you to found that career and tell her can you will talk to other students to come and talk to the teacher so she can help them .

Inconclution people shoud agree that students can commit a career because it will help other students that are in High School and wants to be someone in the future they vere found what career do they want to work or study for ,second they will feel for good if they get the thing by there own ,thrid if they are traying to make something in their country their very try to talk to someone a friend or other person that can help them ,finally they can get more oportunity if they study hard and them founf they career that they wants ."

I'm feel depressed when I don't know about combing computer codes. Also, I can't even focusing on work so I tried to get help with others. Sometimes, I would provide an assistance when I'm doing my work. My friends would teach me for how I do computer coding to get some provide information.

2580,BF72FB4B953F,"Three year graduation

Is it beneficial for students to graduate a year earlier then the rest or could graduating earlier impact a student's health? Many high schools allow students to choose between graduating in three years or the traditional four years. Some students accept this offer with the idea of leaving early and not dealing with drama. In my opinion early graduation is not worth the mental, physical, and emotional stress.

To start off, when you choose to graduate within three years you are choosing to work during summer and do all core classes for junior and senior year in one semester. you worry so much whether you are going to pass or not here is where stress applies. Generic_Name, a college student at John Tyler community college, was suppose to have graduated last year skipping her fourth year but, unfortunately she couldn't keep up with everything. She had to do all her junior classes in one semester and her senior classes during second semester causing her to stress and have a mental breakdown in the middle of her Biology class. After consulting with her guidance counselor she came to the conclusion that she will have to do her fourth year of high school for her mental health's sake.

Now with that being said, transitioning from junior to senior year is hectic. You have to make sure you have enough credits to continue: make sure you keep up with all your classes and their requirements: and you have to stay up late studying and doing homework. A young adult needs at least 8 to 7 hours of sleep to properly function through out the day. A student that stays up doing late night homework and studying do not obtain most of those hours leaving them with only 2 to 3 hours to sleep;therefore causing them to be tired all day long the next day. The lack of sleep has a big impact on a student who wants to graduate early, for they fall asleep in class and miss out on important notes.

In addition, the simple attempt to graduate is emotionally stressful. Now imagine only having one year to do both junior and senior classes. Once again you worry about passing but this time you question yourself. You ask yourself "" Am I capable of making it? and Am I smart enough?"" and dwell on these questions. Eventually you start putting yourself down and start thinking whether you made the right choice or not. This is where your emotions come in to play. Meanwhile you are trying your hardest to do all your work you start feeling angry at yourself because you simply can not keep up. Soon enough you give up on everything your education and most importantly your future.

On the contrast, for many high school students graduation is an exit ticket. The faster we manage to graduate the better. We no longer have to wake up early in the mornings, we do not have to interact with students and their negative attitudes, and we no longer have to be caught up in high school drama. but even though graduating early seems glorious it is not worth all the emotional, mental, and physical stress of doing both years in one semester.

In conclusion, three year graduation is more than just saying "" let's do it!"". It takes away from your sleeping schedule; stressing you out when you fall asleep in class and fail to copy notes. Causes you to worry so much whether you are going to pass or not and mentally stress. you eventually start to question yourself, feel insecure and emotionally stressed. Graduating early seems glorious but once again it is not worth all the stress.                   "
1359,6867A6767D25,"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why

I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go.

In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and there's no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you should'nt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective don't get involved as much as your other friends is.

Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people don't like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials.

In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students don't have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. It's just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to King's Dominion and once your there you well be like I've earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something that's giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view I'm working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do.

Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they don't because we're a family and something we always say when we're down is ''dream, believe, achieve ''. This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also you're parents and family .

In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you don't have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

2457,B6F445EE304C,"Dear principle:

I think that changing policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a good idea. Students mostly don't try hard unless they're rewarded. If you change this policy maybe students will try on they're best to get a grade B or above. They will see their friends playing all these activities on their hard and best work. So next time they would want to try hard and play those activities.

On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. If kids try their best on the subject and still don't get a grade B average, this wouldn't be fair to them. They would be a lot of students who wouldn't agree with me because of this reason.

Changing school policy isn't a great idea, but to make the students get good grades and to benefit their lives, in that case then it would be good idea. Not every students will agree with me but that's the best way to get them educated even though it wouldn't be fair.

sincerely yours,

Bad chose, like people teens tin to make bad chose when they are around other people. Even around there friends they like to do stuff you should be doing like doing drugs, spelling and getting into tridol. Having a mindset that they need to live up to standers because it a tread or it's Popper. And it's usley young teens because they are always on sholmetuy,seeing all these's videos of people,getting frames over something sipol,they think that they can do it to. If a young kids see's someone doing drugs or stilling from a story they are most likely to do the same, it has a big inmates on the young generation,people don't know how much it efets them.

Snead people want respect but don't know how to give it back, like for insteps if you tire other with respect then they well give it back. Don't give yourself a bad name like if you opliyening for a job but the manger saw you stell something he or her is not going to trust you anymore, you need to urn that trust. A other thing is not to be rude because if your rude to people well think of you densely,do to you being rude and not good with people. And trite them how you would want to be tread with respect and not being rude to people if you give them all of that they well do the same for you. And that's what's truly inppont in life.

So in other words be around the people you love and that well bring the good out of you,don't give yourself a bad name in this world. Be who you wanna be in those world but think before you chose."
3228,E1B30D0F1F11,"Do you ever just wonder how school would be like if you could pick your own classes/electives? My opinion is that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. There are many reasons why I think the above. Sudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. Student want to be taking or doing many things that they are into to. I think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives.

Strudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what intesrests them. For example, I do not like to take music, it bores me. I would rather take drama. People are very diferent from each other. Such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in thiose kind of electives/classes. We just need to give students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thing.

Counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. The reason why I think this is because all electives should not be classes in general. For example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, ect. They can be taking another math class. If thats what they love learning about because with art, we cant do anything with it in the future. Which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything.

Students want to be doing many things that they love in school. Yes, that is very true. CLASSES THAT ARE FOR FUN SHOULD BE ELECTIVES!! Not required. We should just think about what we like to do best. Everyone should be able to pick their own classes.

In conclusion, music, drama, and art should not be required. Student like to do what they like best. Counselors/teachers should be picking those classes for us."
1739,8399BA1DF44B,"I am not agree because everybody in this world can be freedom to think or to do whetever they wan because we have the independence of right. They can enthusiasm for things or wons that they did.

If they want to do that the rule said is they decition,or they opioniom because they are freedom right, but i am disagree with thus rule for one reason, that it's. That if they don't want to failure you have to fight for yours dreams for everythink that you can do it, and say thank u god for give me that opportunity and say i am so pround of me.

you never give up just kept going and follow your dreams to have a good future and don't be failure and don't play with that things beacuse you can practice once and you can take that thing for a while of your life.

I will give you one example for this thing, you see the poor people that they follow the rules just for money or do whetever things just for money is because they just wanna a good future for they kid's and they don't wanna failure they just fight for they kid's to have a good education and they hope that one they they can be somebody profetional like doctor and help them family to get out the situation of poor.

I hope that everyone in this world can see the right things and complete and don't be afraid if you don't do nothing bad why you suppost to be afraid you have your right laws. If you play wiht that thing you can fail in your life, but you can learn that way because when you broken down and you say i can't continue with this, is when you have to say i am stronger, the life give a leason, and i learn about that. Now i see and i can be better.

You can see now that you can do it. When you wish something like be profetional, soccer player, but if you play with failure you can fail thats right you can not have to play wiht that.

Also there is going to be peoples in your way that they dosen't want that you can be happy, like a fake friends, and sometimes we were really surprised because someones in your family are fake too, but don't pay atention to them just focus in your dreams and finish.

Another example is my self because when i came in United States, i don't even know English and i thoght that will be more difficul for me, i thoght that i will fail every class, but is not how was i thihk because i just focus in my class and i work hard every single day, and i never fail one class that's right you never have to loss the enthusiasm in your life and enjoy every single day, because the life is just one and we has to make the most of opportunitys in this life, and be happy every single day.

When i came in United States without my parents i thoght that will be more difficul for me, at the beginnig was so hard because i always live with them but i never give up because i know that they want a good future for me and i saw that way and now i juts want to help them because they are a good example in my life they say to me, son just fight for your dreams and don't worry about us you know that will be ok and that's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i want to reversed the help that they give me one day.

My father and my mother say, you arer the reason for work and fight so hard for you. You will have a good future don't be afriad don't loss your enthusiasm. That's right i never loss my enthusiasm because i take the example that they give me because i wanna be a good example for my childrens and be like my parents or better.

When you have a problems to solve and you feel that you can fail just think creatively about different ways to solve and actively work to balance your mind, health and emotions or enthusiasm. we have to develop many ways to solve the problems. Our environment it will be consider many perspectives, and how we can work to balance our mind, health and see many solutions in our life.                     "
3611,F3ACD9A99ADA,"Success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience.

My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I loss my job because I didn't have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is a example how failure didn't take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later.

My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want,

A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didn't pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success.

Other might say that success and failing isn't good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say ''You can loss a battle but not the war'', In fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm.

In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchill's statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don't surrender don't give up with our goals, always been happy doesn't paying attention to the situation.

2926,D2E2605EE795,"Do i agree or disagree that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow? In my own opinion i say i would agree in my 17 years on this earth that i have to agree because if you stay to comfortable you won't do anything in life you will want it all easy and not try to strive for the best version of yourself.

you can stay comfortable but it won't help because your just wasting time and effort that you could become a better human being and spread your knowledge with other people. You should always try to strive to become the best you can be.

I say people should agree on this because not trying to fix your or improve yourself is not the best way to go. Like they shouldn't disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that can't help themselves. us humans should help everyone we can even if it's little people sometimes don't ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help.

Some people also may disagree because they might think only about themselves or they think that there at a good point that they dont have to try anymore or try there very best they think thieve mastered the problems and situations. They think that they can't learn anything else but there wrong we human beings can always learn something more strive to be better humans, father,mothers,sons,daughters etc... but the point is don't settle for okay do more.

We Should learn not to stay cozy you should try to improve a bit everyday or learn something new help yourself and help each other out if they need help or if you need it learning and talking to other people wont hurt you so like

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow""

is a true fact and you should try to be a better human or person in life and become someone that people can look up too."
3395,E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you won't grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing?

First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldn't you want to challenge yourself with new things?

It's good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things.

Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You can't master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good.

Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be.

However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you don't work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you don't do that than you would struggle a lot in life.

In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and don't want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because you're going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldn't it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? "
1351,6805FE96E548,"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.

A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.

Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.

Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.

In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.     "
581,2C34CE94B837,"I should be picked for this internship because I am a hard working person , I am a risk taker and im open minded .I am hard working when I am assigned to a task and in general I dont give up easy and I work until I believe I have done it to the best of my ability . For example one day i was assigned a project with a group of other students , my group was full of slackers and i had to do it all on my own.

I put in all my time and effort and dedication into it , my project ended up getting the highest grade than most of the other groups. ive been told i am a risk taker ,I do things others would consider to be rational or crazy. On a different project I worked on

I chose to do the most challenging one , no one would take it because there was a lot of writing needed to be put in and a lot of researching and information needed to be discovered .

I

am not afraid of challenges I like them I like expanding my knowledge and going above and beyond ,showing others my potential . I

am open minded when it comes to others and my ability to work well with others and communicate with them will blow your mind i am not afraid to talk in a crowd or present and i take joy in working with others and helping them out . I am very open minded when it comes to people and my education . although there might be some ideas we dont always agree on ,i accept it and respect there work ethic and give them my a hundred percent attention and try my best to understand them , and their point of view and where they are coming from . One time , there was this new kid at my school he was coming from Brazil . Know one would speak to him or make any interaction with him. so i took the liberty in talking to him and making him feel welcome into our school and letting him know he was not alone that he has a friend,that was me , after talking with him for awhile i then tried to understand and put myself in his shoes he was a scared boy coming to a new country for the first time with his mom and not being able to know the language and how different the lifestyles are from here and Brazil was very difficult for him and is family so i wanted to help . i made him feel better by taking some time and teaching him English now he speaks English fluently and he thanks me for all of done for him . this was one of the reasons why i love working with others and helping others out .although some people might say that i am a little too straight forward ,others will say that they appreciate my honesty , therefore i should be chosen to have this opportunity in taking this internship because i would be a great candidate for it and it would really mean a lot to me my goal in life is to be successful and get my family out of the projects and into a better lifestyle and this internship would be a step in the right direction . i promise you , you wont regret it ."
716,37193A72B5D2,"Teachers and some adults think that some students are expected and have the capacity to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Student are the only ones who can decide If they are able to take care of that responsibility or not.

In my opinion I think different and I don't think that young students are able to carry out with a career and a will support my reasons. First of all I think about all of that students who are already independent by their self, they probably have a job and need to pay their own bills, the rent, their phone, and they maybe have no time to carry out with all of that responsibilities with their education and the career at the same time, they need to work hard study and that is not easy for them. As the same time they probably have a lot of homework to do and they need to be responsible at their job. Another good reason I have is that some students without time they have no help, and they have no support from other people to try and see if they are able or they are already capacity to care about the career in high school, many students are able to do it but some of them are not able to pay for the help or the stuff need for the classes, some students have the luck to find people who just want to help them, and give them the opportunities to go on and help them with the decision they take to carry out with the career in high school but teacher or other people just don't want to help them just because they think and the give their opinion that they are not ready to take that decision and they still learning and have not the capacity to work on it and they just leave them and the don't give the students the opportunity to explain or show them that they are able to do it. Also a lot of students are fighting and giving all of they can with their education and they are giving up, they get tired with all the classes they have with all the responsibilities they are carry on and that why is hard for them keep studding in high school but must of the student are strong and still working to getting prepare even if they are having problems at their house or problems with their family they just wanna move on. Even though that some of students are too young in high school and they are still learning about how life is, how hard is to take care about the responsibilities the adults are already taking on and they think how hard can be if they take the decision to identify a career by the time they enter in high school it can be difficult to them because with the rest of the courses the are taking they will take more then normal classes. For some reason the students are not even thinking about their career when they are just enter the high school they are probably focus in the responsibilities they are going to have or they are already have in high school with their education, they have to take care of them. A lot of student make a mistakes, for example when they doesn't care about their education and they focus on being the best in their personality how many friends can they have or how good can they look, they need to ripen on their attitude and star thinking about their education they need to think how good in their education can be better on or how good grades can they have to make their family proud or how far can they go if the keep working hard and make proud of their self.

People can think that it would be easy for them or some of they can think that it will not. I think that it is not a good idea selected to guide them toward a specific career, thats why I just explain my reasons so they can see that it will be difficult, hard and stressful, they are too young and they can't take care of a big responsibility."
1974,953BEF800163,"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need.

To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step.

Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and she's a junior. When we don't have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; she's not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior.

Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, I've heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when they're in college.

To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature. Lastly, they will have more acknowledge in everything. High school, its one of the best step of your life, where after you graduated from there, you would like to come back and stay more than four years."
982,4B174612FD60,"Imagine oneself is a student in high school who is already stressed out by all of the homework and work that One must already finish during the day, but also all of the classwork that oneself did not get to finish during school. Students are already stressed out because of school work, letting a student use their phone as a learning tool would only benefit them in finishing their work on time. This is why teachers should let students utilize their phones as a learning tool and not be against the usage of it when doing school work.

Admittedly, students could get distracted with their phones and not get their work done in time. However, Teachers can specify that the use of phones is only for academic use only during classroom hours. That anybody who is not abiding by the rules will automatically get ISS. Therefore, students would understand that it is a serious matter and would not be playing around with their phones and getting distracted.

Furthermore, students would not have to wait on the schools slow internet and wifi to finish their classwork on time. Students phones work faster than most of the computers in school and they would be able to finish their work faster. For example at the beginning of the school year at SCHOOL_NAME the wifi and internet were down almost every day. Making everybody in the school that has online classes or just courses that require the use of the internet to be behind in all of their work. Also, schools computers are outdated and full of past information that makes the computers work at a much slower pace than a phone would. This is a contributing factor to students not being able to finish their work because the computers are outdated, it takes most of them at least twenty minutes to log in. Those are minutes lost that a student could have been using to have started their class work and possibly even finish it. Consequently, if phones were allowed to be used for class work then students would be able to finish their work on time and not have to worry is the wifi is working or if the computer is taking too long to log on.

In addition, students could take their work home if they are not done with it, and they would not have to worry about being behind on their class work. Students most of the time do not have enough time during class to finish all of their class work. Making their work pile up high and since the school does not let students take computers home they could not take their work home with them. If students have class work on a specific computer app like Microsoft word they would not be able to access it from a computer at their house because they do not have the same system we have in school. For example, one of the classes that I take is econ and personal finance and a lot, if not most of the class is online. If we have to do a vocabulary in Microsoft word

I have no way of accessing that document until the next day and by then we would have something completely different to do. Letting students use their phones to do work like in Microsoft word would mean that students could use their phones to type up their paper in Google classroom and send it in or leave it in the drop box in desire to learn. Hence, why letting students utilize their phones would be a great benefit to them.

In conclusion, letting students utilize their devices as a learning tool or experience would be easier on them. If students are permitted to utilize their phones in the class room then they would not have to worry about not finishing their work during class. This is why students should sign a petition and turn it in to the principal, so the use of cell phones during class work can be permitted and not be frowned upon."
1122,5704CCBC8B55,"I think that my principal need reconsidering the school's cell phone policy.

First of all , the principal should let allow all students to bring phones to school and use them only during lunch periods , free time , and when a student have a emergency . Because you don't if a student's mom is calling because a emergency happen.

As you can see , that the principal need to let the student to have there cell phone , as long as the phone is turned off during class time or is in bivariate . That is why the principal need to let us use the cell telephone during school."
3234,E1EC4869981F,"The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.

If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.

Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.

So, after this many reasons we all know that getting involved in the extracurricular activities can really hurt students. Joining these activities is neither healthy nor good for grades. All this shows that students should choose to be in the activities if they want to not that they are forced to. "
962,4975FA2ABC9D,"In the future what would you like to accomplish in school. Well I would like to know how to play the clarinet and learn how to play it for many reasons.

First, the good thing about about the clarinets is that I like when someone plays the clarinet and it sounds smooth it gives me the chills. Also when they hit a high note on it it gives me chills too. When playing high notes on it it looks easy.

Although when playing the clarinet sometimes when I go to a concert there is always at least one person that squeaks when playing it. I tried to play on it once and its hard to play when I try to play it fast. But the worst part when playing the clarinet is chipping the reed, once when you chip it you won't be able to play as good on it.

The only reason I want to learn how to play the clarinet is because I like the way it sounds, it sounds to calming and soothing. In order for me to accomplish to play calming and soothing is to practice at least 1 hour everyday . Also my last reason to play the clarinet is because i kind of think that it looks easy to play but I guess that it is a hard instrument to play. These are my reason on why i would want to accomplish and play on the clarinet.

1170,5AA45740A848,"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think phone policy at school should not let students use their phone during class or free time. For several reasons. First, school has to be an area of education and not of free time. Because in my point of view its a distraction to your self and the people around you. Second, phones could get stolen by the people you don't get along with. Also, another reason for school policy to know is that it can cause drama between friends and also people you don't know. Finally , phones can cause cheating, cheating is what school doesn't want so that's one of my main reasons why i don't want phones being used in school hours,"
2643,C3E499B46594,"Althogh some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Nevertheless is it not a good idea for students, because they tired more early, bring more focus on some classes but not in the others, and they not take a break on summer.

They can be tired more early because some time they worry for the work that they have . For example, students pass more time study and not take a break. Most students going to school sleep because in the night they study for exams, or make some proyect that they left. most of them have many homework and they not finish on time because they are tired and need to sleep to going with energy on the school though they are not finish the homework. In concept the students need more time to make the school work because if they take the offer to graduate in three years they need to give everything on time.

Most of them bring more focus on some classes that others because they think that some classes are more important and the others not. Nevertheless the grades can be going down for the reasons that the students not put attention on classes, or not make the work. Also they need to make the work of the all classes because that importan, and all classes they need for graduate. This can be give them problems if they not make anything for they grades going up because if they have bad grades they can not graduate in three years. Clearly the students forget the importan that all classes are for graduate.

The students not take a break on summer because they want to going the summer school for make more classes. For example, they make this for graduate more early but, they do not have time for they family or for the work. Many time they need to work on summer and this affect most students, they going the school in the morning and the night they work. some families going anothers countries for vacation and the students can not going for the reason that they need to stick for study. Clearly going on summer school affect students but, this can be help for advance classes.

In conclution some school help students to graduate more early like in three years. The students can be tired because they want to make the more importans classes, but this is more hard. They bring more focus in the importants classes and the others classes not. Most of them need to going on summer school because they need to pass the classes. For all students the graduate is it importans, but everyone need to take the time in the school an have good grades when they are ready to graduate this is more importan. "

Greetings Generic_Name I'am writing this letter to you, to let you know that am very interested on going to visit and learning more about your dealership. For the future am planing on pursuing the Auto tech field. In the past I worked at a Mc Donald's. At the moment am a high school student who is involved in the Auto tech classes, I'm also a member of the engine building team. When I first came to this the U.S I started working with my brother on landscaping, under a lot of pressure.

When I first started working at Mc Donald's I didn't know a lot about how to treat costumers. With in the time I experience multiple occasions in which I had to be patient and listen to the costumers. I had to learn how to work with different people and different personalities. Thanks to the opportunity Mc Donald's gave to work there I gain a lot of knowledge on treating costumers. Now I can say that am confident and willing to work with others and help costumers.

At the moment I'm involved in the auto tech classes and am a member of the engine building team which take place after school. Being in this classes has help me learn and gain experience on cars. This classes have taught me how to be organized and clean with the tools. In the engine team I learn how to be faster on everything and also being careful. Graduate being a Auto technician is my goal.

When I first came to the United States I needed to work, thats when I started working in landscaping with one of my older brothers. working in landscaping is hard, you have to deal with heavy equipment sometimes. I remember my brother use to put a lot of pressure on me sometimes, because he needed the job to be done in one day. There I learn how to control myself during peer pressure. Thanks to my brother now I know how to use power equipment and delicate tools.

With all this being said I will like to be selected to go visit your dealership and learn more about it. I see many oportunities for me at your dealership. I will like to have an Idea of what are the requirements to pursue the auto tech field. With all my experience I'm positive and confident that I can achieve my goal of being a technician one day. I will also like to thank you for taking your time to read this letter.   "
638,30DDC17D2986,"First impressions are very important but could they be changed?. Yes, yes they could be changed because first impressions don't justify who you are as a person and some people don't act the same when you first meet them. However some people are really judgmental about first impressions and could block off any type of relationship they had with you being job related, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend, and friends.

First impressions are serious which drives a lot of people insane. Because they don't know how the people are going to react to them but, its okay that doesn't define who you are as a person. A great tip of advice is being able to read a room that means how people are acting in certain time and place. Like whats the vibe and mood if you should be more relaxed, goofy,serious etc. If you can read a room first impressions will become a lot easier because you will know how to act.

But that's not the only way to have a good first impression most people dont act the same say on the first date,its probably going to be awkward and silent because you dont know how to act verses seeing someone for the 5th time. You know what to say, you know how to have an okay conversation. But dates arent the only situations that first impressions fall into. Jobs, jobs are the biggest make or break for first impressions from experience you can't be nervous and just be real you dont have to act differently. If your job takes you for what you have then its a great job.

However first impressions are very very judgmental. Some people take first impressions over anything because its the first glimpse they have of you and how you act as a person. And if they dont like you won't give you a job or another date depending on the situation. And there is nothing you can do about it. not even getting the chance to change the first impression. So is it hard to change a first impression yes,but its not impossible."
3609,F39FFFB63840,"I agree that failing plays a important role of success. Is because you can learn form your miss tack, you can understand why your keep failing and fix the problem, and you don't make a same miss tack again. However, I do see why some people don't think the same way. It because they don't want take a risk to fail at anything and no one want to admit that they failed on something. But it not as bad as you think, hears why.

First, everyone my miss tack and you can learn from that miss tack . For examples, when I failed to shot a goal, I what to know why I keep missing a goal. After a weal I learn how to properly shot it. A nuder examples are, my friend like to draw a person but he always have a problem to draw a hands. He try to learn why he keep failed to draw a hands and time go by, he finally learn how to draw a hands.

Then, you can understand why you keep failing and fix the problem. For instens, I always keep failing to payatensh, so I understand what was a problem and trying to fix that problem. A nuder examples are, when I keep reading I always keep miss pushing it . So I be reading thirty mines every day and it help me.

Lastly, you won't make a same miss tack again. For examples, when I found out that I failed my reading test I what to know what part that I miss, when I toked again I pass the reading test. A nuder examples are, when I made a miss tack to get a figure that almost filthy baler, and at the same time I have to pay my bills. So I learn my miss tack, at the time when I pay my bills I won't get a figure that almost filthy baler.

Inconclusun, failure is not as bad as you think, it can help you to success for instens you can learn form your miss tack, you can understand why your keep failing and fix the problem, and you don't make a same miss tack again. I hope you understand why failing plays a big role of success."
3639,F50C9936F416,"Some schools have a program that older students pair with younger students and lets talk about how the effects can be very beneficial in the students future.

One reason this would be most beneficial is that the younger students are getting there education from someone who already knows about the basic of reading, pronouncing words the younger students just have not reach potentacil and these older students are pushing these younger kids the right way.

Another reason Having older students pair up with younger students is a very beneficial idea is that it teaches a students what skills are necessary to be a teacher just encase they want to be a teacher one day.

Third reason a younger student pairing up with an older student is beneficial is because it makes the older student feel more responsible for somebody else is learning like making sure the younger student knows this like making sure he/she knows how to pronounce words correctly make sure the younger student can be organized.

A fourth reason that proves younger kids pairing up with older kids is beneficial is that the teacher has a couple less students to deal with so less stress to deal with younger kids can be annoying to deal with sometimes."
3808,FB73ABAB1D14,"Students should have the right to elect their classes that they want to take in school, because it's all about in how capable the students are or how much the students can learn if they have the chance to elect their classes. It's hard for some students to learn a class that it have been given to him/her. Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didn't had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of.

However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school.

The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, it's something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status. Most of the students from the age of ten years and up are still developing their brains and they can get easily distracted. Most of the parents in the

U.S they won't let their kids watch TV for more than thirty minutes, because they can create a habit and they will spend more of their time watching TV, playing video games and more.

In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that.

In my life experience, I have become successful in the things that I have done while being in school, because my parents always told to pick something that I would like from school, and I choose to practice sports and after choosing something that I considered good for me and my future, I received an scholarship for soccer. All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future. I completely disagree with the people believing that students should be require to take music, drama, and art classes, because all of this might take all the good opportunities away from your child and it will become a distraction for them."
3454,EC8590A774E6,"I think self-esteem comes from real achievement because if you're not doing your best work In class and you feel like its not good enough, and someone tells you what you did wasnt good enough then it will just make you want to do better. On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if you're self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice to be self confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you they're ugly how will you feel? Of course you will feel some type of way because that's just how the human body works, but you know what? It dont matter what people think. If you Got an affinity for those type of shoes then it dont matter what people got to say about your shoes. At the end of the day its what you like not what other people like. People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. Always remember that only god can judge you. Therefore you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive. That will help you build up better self-esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what. Dont be something that you're not just because your friend likes you that way, be yourself and if that friend is really your friend he will accept you for who you really are. "
34,0369AD4B5726,"I would agree with being honest at all times because if I'am honest, I'am telling the truth and I'm not lying towards anyone. The reason why being honest is the best policy is that people can really trust me if they ask me a question or if I need their help with any of my work even if they are not honest or completely honest with any of their work. I think that honesty would be number one in my personality because people get smarter when they grow and honesty will be in my life mostly from the start. Another reason why honesty is very important in my life would be to believe that I'm not going to fail a test or I won't get bullied in the future. But sometimes honesty would fail and some people are going to get angry with me when they actually trusted me. Then they might have learned a lesson to not trust me in their entire life ever again. That would be sad if I said I were honest that this would happen and I was actually positive about it just to make my friend or my family member happy instead of thinking about all the negative things that are going to happen which actually might have a tiny chance to happen or not happen. After a negative relationship about honesty happens with my friend or family member, they would disagree on my honesty and might never trust me again and find someone smarter than me. Later in my life, my friend or family member might apologize to me when they could not trust me in the past. The relationship with my family member or friend might come back together again and they might agree with my honesty once again and we might never get into a fight about honesty and relationships ever again. But what if my friend or family member found more than one person besides me to trust in their honesty. We might have a huge debate going on about that and also get into a fight that would never stop. It would be best to not have a huge argument about honesty and I can meet with the other person face to face and have a conversation with them which is not that harmful and nobody will hurt anyone's feelings or my friend or family member would not allow me to be with them their entire life anymore. That would be better because it would be best to gather as many people as I know because then me and other people who are very good with honesty can help my friends and my family members stop thinking about negative relationships and we can make them think about positive relationships so they won't get stressed out or they won't have any attacks when they think about anything that makes them feel sad or other dangerous thoughts like suicidal thoughts, dying by doing drugs, getting into a car crash etc. Even if someone tells me that they cannot trust me and they disagree with my honesty, I don't have any dangerous thoughts about death. I will fight back for my position in honesty even if many people trusted my honesty and I failed them in my honesty. Still, my honesty is not a failure. I will be honest my entire life and I will never lose my most important personality about me which is honesty. If I think I'm going to fail a test on the first attempt. I'm always honest that I will not fail this test today and I'm going to try so hard on this test that I pass and I will win and be happy with my own honesty that I trust. Sometimes if I forget to study for a test, it's not honesty's fault I failed. It's my fault I did not study for the test because most of the answers I got wrong in the test is because I guessed instead of knowing the correct answer. If I can't trust honesty or if I don't need it now. I'll use my honesty if I really need it help me succeed so I won't be a failure in life. I would want everyone to have honesty as their number one personality because honesty can really help everyone solve many conflicts that are not easy to solve in one attempt and I might need help with it. Most people disagree with being honest at all times and they say it's not their number one personality because people first have to learn the true meaning of honesty and how it can actually help me succeed in your life. Most of the time, people think that very smart people have the best honesty and they might agree with their honesty for some reason. But they're wrong, I can trust everyone's honesty. It's not like people who are not smart don't have the best honesty and people who are smart have the best honesty, they're equal. People who are not that smart can grow in the future and their honesty can lead to many people supporting someone who was not smart in the past and is now smart in the future. Same with smart people, they can either continue to grow or their smartness has a tiny chance of dropping. Then people in the future for some reason would continue to trust smart people even if I know that their smartness and their true honesty has dropped which would mean that they started to lie in the future and in the past they would tell the truth. That would be the reason why smart people in the past might start to lie about most of their things in the future if nobody teaches them to never get into the non honesty mode. The right people that can reteach me about honesty if you lose it would be either your family members or teachers because you don't goof around with my family and my teachers that often, it's mainly with my friends because they can try to get me into a different world to forget about honesty and everyone will wonder what happened with being honest and why can't they trust me anymore. Same with people who grow, my friends and family members will be suprised how I learned to be honest and how most people can trust me now. They would be put in a totally different world and they would be thinking. ""How did they change in the future?"" ""I thought they would still be the same their entire life?"" Finally, once they figured out how I changed in the future. They will probably inform everyone about the person that has changed. That is why honesty is number one for everyone lives and it's best."
49,043B9F48FDC2,"Should all the students have to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Or should it be an electives and they could be able to make their choice to take what they want.

I believe that everyone have different opinion , interest, or things they want to do. They are able to make their on decision but i don't think that it has to be required to take a class that some people aren't interested in. I am disagree with this prompt because those classes should an elective. In my opion i wouldn't take any of those classes and my reason why is because i am not going to enjoy or like the class because i am not interesting in it and there's not a required that i have to take any of those classes. I had a friend who didn't want to come to his art class. One day i asked him why don't you go to that class and he was like i don't like the class, i don't enjoy it at all and also i didn't choice it, they just put it in my schechule. i was like look you should go to the office and talk to them about it. Because you dont want to be there and also you don't even come to that class and after a few days and he went to talk to his consul about it. Less than a week he always be in his class and i was like it's your own choice to make desicion but i resolve it be cause you helped me.

But in other school i have one friend that he loves his art class and now he's taking it almost every year and he told me. Generic_Name you should take an art class because it's really cool and you do a lot of art also i enjoy it and i really like the class but i don't know what do you like but in my perpective i would take an art class every year. I told him look i am not going to take a class that i don't like because i'd rather be in a class that i like and i would enjoy it and i want to do stuff that i like and it will be my choice if i enjoy or not a class. Because look there's a lot of option and you can make a decicion and he told me "" Yeah you right"" and by it i just tell them everybody have to make their own decion but also remember that every decion have a concecuense. I asked a lot of people what would you do if they put you in a classs that you don't want to be in it?. They told me i just going to talk in the ofice so they can change it and i would love to come to that class but i also have the right to say something about if i don't like or i do like something cause we have a right to speak up.

We should be able to choice what we want to study we don't have to have a requiered to do things we could do things by our own. But there might be a thing that make people think we should have a required to take classes that we don't want but also they have to think about that we are teenager and we might have our future planed but if they don't know that they have to take some classes they don't even want to take then those type of things make people think that's why we have to take classes to prove ourself. Another things and it influence a lot that they make required to do things and students just don't want to they have to think how we feel about things and how we would react. We all know that sometimes we are not in a mood or we are in our feeling or we just don't feel the day at all and it can affect our decion and required because people who make the required they just don't care about how would you feel or anything they just chose what they want and they say what they think will be better for a lot of students but the thing they don't think about it how would react to thing like i said earlier every decion has a consecuense and it could be good or bad but we have to deal with it.

Most of the students would like to have all classes how they want and when they cannot do something they want then there's when the things starting coming out. Becuase they don't like it their behavior chnage and everything in that class. So all studesnts should be able to have the right to change things and everything in their schedule but their consul should have the right to say no to things that are not important at all and they could say you are taking this class because of this reason and you can't do it. Of course they will say something but they are taking care of their future and things they would do in life by taking any of this three classes. It might be good thing or it could be a bad thing but we just have to lisent to our students.

Everyone have a right to make their own desion about classes and others things but if there's a required we are not able to do anythig. Because we just have to respect the rules and do it without our opinion. If we are able to make a choice then our feeling and the way we would feel about classes it will be matter and we could make our decicion and we will like the thing we choose. But sometimes we just cannot make the decision and someone else would chose it for us so we just have to see the pro and con about the desicion we would make or the thing we would do without thinking. I think it shouldn't be a required to take this classes and it would be a elective class because some people wouldn't take this type of classes they are not going to enjoy it and go because they just don't like it at all and everyone have the desicion to speak up and make decision by our own."

It's almost impossible to change, I'm agree with this statement, for example, you saw an ugly food, you not eating it, anyhow it good eating or no. Next, if one person give you bad inpressions, maybe you not try to talk to him or her. Finally, if you want to shopping, you will saw the appraisal about the store.

First, when you go to any restaurant to finish lunch or dinner, you want a perfect food for yourself. you waiting for food like 15 minute, after 15 minute, the food coming, but, the food looking for squeamish, you will disappointment, because, you feeling it's a bad food and can't eating that. If are pretty food on you desk, you don't care how was food, just try it first.

Secondly, you parents introduce someone to you, this guy talking too mach, the mouth can't stop,

just like fly. however, you hate people talk too much and want quiet. Than,behave of this guy let you discontent. you will hate this guy also, want leave to him or her. This impression will let you apart to this guy.

Third, when you go to shopping with best friend, but, here are new place for your guys, just came only 1 day, you don't know anywhere to shop, than you will check to cell phone to find a store. When you find a store, the things looking for pretty, your want to go, however, your saw the all appraisal are bad, only 3 or 4 appraisal are good, than, you will change other one, because, your think the quality of needs are bad.

If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the streets after those hours would be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives?

Curfew helps young kids to stay out of trouble because it can be dangerous. For example, if they just wording around at night they don't know what can happened like they can get kidnap, and be at a place at a wrong time. They can think it's cool but in reality it's not. If a police men stop or pull you over you can get in to trouble because they gonna ask if your parents know you out or if they know where you at and if you said no they gonna call you parents and ask them to come and get you.

Sometimes your parents can get worry if you not home. Kids want to meet up with there friends just to hang out but is it really worth it or to get in trouble knowing your friends ain't gonna have your back. Curfew keep teens from getting in trouble. Although curfew can be good but it shows that your parents can trust you. Night can be really dangerous because you can't see in the dark and you don't know what can be out there. There can be drunk drivers at night also.

Curfew is a law so if you go out late at night you would be breaking the law. Police man really do be canning this serious. All they want is kids to stay safe and be good also to listen to their parents. Teens think that meeting up with there friends at night is cool. But parents just want there kids to behave and listen so they won't get in serious trouble. Why lose your parent trust over some friends that ain't gonna talk to you later in life. Be smart on what side you try to be. Not everything is all about friends you gotta put your parents first then your friends that why them made a curfew.

Plus it the matter of respect for your parents.

Curfew actually helps teens from doing wrong things. Teens don't think that there parents gonna find out but when they get that call saying mom you gonna get nervous or scared because you dont't know what to say for being at late. Parents can be smart at times when they want to but they do be catching here kids in the act of sneaking out ! Teens really do have a choice by picking stay home or go out and have fun. People really care about this law. Who wanna see a kid walking alone without no parent around. Teens just need to sleep or play on there gaming systems . You can hang out with your friends during the day or have a sleep over . Whatever you can do to hang out with your friends but DON'T GO SNEKING OUT TO GO GET FOOD OR TO BE WITH YOUR GRILFRIEND! Just stay at home call up your friends or even your girlfriend so you won't put your self at a higher risk of getting in trouble.

Overall just stay out of trouble and have your parents trust. Don't do nothing stuiped. Stay at home make do homework or watch a movie just don't sneake out jsut to do stuff thats gonna get you in trouble."
1065,51C93A7260DE,"Have you ever thought what school would be like for you and other, students in your school would have a program where older and younger kids will gather around, do different activities and projects and learn at the same time.

Think about programs you will want to be included in your school,that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently,you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily bases. In my opinion i feel like students feel more better and cofterble talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. There's times where student's feel more pressured by an adult so that's what makes them not want to ask for help.

Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you dont really know theres other people you havent met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program.

So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other student's gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school. Is not just in the program that will be in your school but people that you walk by every other day gather around and teach everyone something new and they can give back to you and teach you something new everyday to anyone in the program.

But back to the main starting point of the paragraph if you want to start a new program at your school talk to one of your teachers or your principle and share the ideas you have thought of or the ideas you have in mind and gather around to start something new and make school a better place. "
939,4800E073664A,"I do agree with what Ralph Emerson wrote. Being myself in a world that is being nonstop trying to make you something else that is not you, is a very good accomplishment you've overcome. There is always challenges in life where you would have to be yourself. If you can't be yourself then you should ask for advice from your family on how you can be yourself. If you aren't yourself and you've become different from yourself and its not always good. It's like letting the world win by changing you. You should always be yourself no matter what you come across, listen to you and your family, and don't lose to the world by not being yourself.

In life no matter what you come across, you should always be yourself. Don't let anyone force you to be someone else because you might not even like who you've become. People who aren't themselves usually are going through some serious stuff or just want attention. Being yourself is really hard when there are hard challenges you have come across that tries to make you different from yourself. Being yourself is the best accomplishment you can earn when in a world that is trying to make you something else.

You should always listen to yourself and your family. Getting advice from your family is the best because they've been alive longer than you and have more knowledge in how they've became there self and not anything else. Listening to yourself is good because you're doing what you want to do, what your mind is telling you. If you become something else and your mind was telling you not to, then you should re-evaluate your thoughts and be yourself. Family are related to you, they have similar mindset as you, and they should understand you more than anyone else in this world.

At the end of the day, you know who you are; if you aren't yourself its like letting the world win by changing you and losing because you aren't yourself. You're showing us you aren't capable of the world, you can't handle the world because you're not thinking about your decisions and letting the world change you. You know what you can do and can't do. If you know you can change then go for it and change. Changing can be hard but you should take it slow, think about what you want to change. It's a great feeling knowing you've changed because you know you have achieved your goal.

Ralph Emerson won against the world trying to change him because he realized people change and aren't themselves anymore and spoke out. Don't let anything try to change you, you do you. Listen to people that are close to you and you trust. Aim for your goals and take your time, don't be anyone else. Therefor win, not lose and be you.         "
3864,FE60E597467E,"What is positive attitude? Positive attitude is when a person has positive thoughts about something that went wrong or good, but they see all the possibles ways to success in life. Having a positive attitude is essential in lifestyle, this can bring happiness to your life, and can take you to extraordinary places. I think having a positive attitude is important because this is a way to express yourself around others, and to show the way you can manage your thoughts. I agree that having positive attitude is the key to success in life, and that everyone should have a positive attitude not just for a work area but anywhere.

There are many reasons to have a positive attitude, for example: you may want to have a positive attitude when you get a bad grade on the test, because you can think positive and say: "" I did bad on this test today but, I am going to keep trying and studying hard every time so I can do better"".

Another example is when you are doing a sport and you think you can't do it and that you are going to give up, you can tell yourself you can do it and have a positive attitude towards it. There are always problems in the daily life, and people deal with this problems not always with a good attitude.

What will happen if you don't have a positive attitude? Well if you don't have a positive attitude, you won't have success in life because you are going to have negativity in your mind and the word ""fail"" is going to become one of your favorites. Having a positive attitude is not always easy, and not all people have it. A negative attitude is the opposite of a positive attitude, and this can affect your life. For example: In school if you have a bad attitude things can go bad, when you are always being negative usually your problems don't get fix and you struggle more with your thoughts. This can mentally affect you, and teenagers are challenged every day by this issue.

The key is positively to a succesful life. I personally consider myself as a postive person. I try to solve every problem with a positive attitude because when I do so, my problems get fix the good way and I am happy with the results. If I don't have a postive attitude, all my goals would be nothing, I get stress and change my attitude, and I even hurt people's feelings without knowing. Success is important too because by this you can be a better person for society, people can judge you differently and you can help others when they are going through a lot. Positively is also mental strength,

it expands your knowledge, it changes the way you think about everything, and makes your life easier.

In conclusion, having positive attitude helps you to have success in life. Sometimes it's hard to understand how people can be so positive about everything, but not all people are happy in their lifes. Some people have their reasons to not be positive, and it's important to understand these people. Other people, like me, have postitive attitude towards anything, which is good because it helps you in your daily life, work, school and others activities. A lot of people like other people with a positive attitude, because it brings positive energy and hapiness to other people's life. Everyone should have a positive attitude, if you are not a positive person, it's not to late to change the way you are living , and it's time to have more positive thoughts and say "" positive"" for a successful life.

1829,89C7C4115B84,"One place that i really want to go is Generic_City, Italy. i really want to go here mainly because of the stuff i can do their. I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy make's like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel.

The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and i'll always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"". My cousin always modifies if cars (he's also a car guy) he's another reason why i like cars. He has a Rx-7 every single part is modified he spend more money on his car then he does of him self. When i grow up i'm going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars.

I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just don't want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country.

I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture.

Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didn't know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters.

This is why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. because of all off these fun stuff i can do their. All of these are reasons why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. I hope one day i can go to Italy and explore their.    "
3172,DF149975C610,"I agree with emerson's statement. I will grow every day, I do best in life. When I wake up most days, I think on my goals. I will reach my dream in my school to grow better in Algebra. I will grow in my school , to improve my english. to set up my plan to become a doctor. I study hard every day. I can do this finish my goals. I work hard. I feel tired most all the time , but that is not my stop sing to leave my school. I will finish finish as soon is possible I will be satisfied getting my goals done.

I disagree we don't have to challenge other person's to do better. Some people they are satisfied what they have,for example job,school, and other activities. may be they still in high school and they are no ready to go to the next level to go the college.

In my case, I want more challenge on me to have a better job, better opportunities, to support my family. Majority of people think, I can't complete my studies or finish my school. I believe on me, I will grow up to see my self in a good job, I will grow in Math, english and History. I believe also some people, are happy what they have in life. Further they will discover new ideas, to put in order to bring on their future plans to move on to the next activity or achivement.

People grow evendough, when they have done journey in life to achieve their goals. I saw some students today. They were my classmate in the same school where I done too, now present day some of them are lawyers, profesors, and doctors. Solutions I agree we should learn new things in life, is important to have wisdom to share. I agree I can get my High School Diploma.

I will motivated people to back school to done education. To do progress in life, we do have to find the excited things what should like to do. If we are good in soccer, let's go play soccer. if we like music, we should find the ways how to learn to sing. I agree I'm the solution to get things done one of them my education. I disagree I am no the problem to stop my goals.

Finally with effort one day, I can be a doctor. I know is no goig to be easy. I love dificult things on me to get my dream to become thrue.

satisfied is a word I will declined, I will see my self with my family, friends, and teachers given me my diploma. I respect people, is satisfied with their goals.

In my opinion, if we have the opportunity to have a better future. We do have to challenge our soul. To become a such a profesional to help our world. We should live in peace, a share the wisdom, and love around the world with people. "
298,15FD5B635B50,"Did you know 67 percent of people talk to more than one person for advice. They do that because different people might have different views of the situation. Although some people experienced the situation. The advice might be useful for other people too. It can help them agree with the choice or decision they will make.

One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people won't. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice.

Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it.

Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing. To ask their opinions to see if they are thing as you are. To see if you agree with them. They might have a lot in common with with about the situation.

In conclusion why people ask multiple people for their opinions is to see their points of view and to make sure of what you are doing. The people you ask may have experienced it the thing they are going through"
2792,CC149CD4B584,"In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online."
971,4A4B45273A9D,"Many people do not like to be a idle. In many states ,cities, and also country a lots of people like to work because many of them have responsibilities . If we are always doing something , Of course that we deserve more because we work for living , for pay taxes , and bills . People have different jobs , people who were young and get graduated and they went to university has a better jobs , they work in offices ,or like a doctors, nurses,lawyers,and many more. People who did not graduated for any reasons they don't have jobs like that others one . Its not bad to not get graduated many people do not get graduated , or not go to the university because maybe they did not have that money to pay that bills from the university . But anyways they also can get a great jobs .

Example, I have 2 old brothers one is 22 , and the second one is 27 they two have a different jobs , The oldest one he get graduated, and also he went to the university now he's a lawyer , he work 5 days of week , and he always told be that I have to be someone in this country (USA). My brother who is 22 and does not like school , does not like the university , and also do not like to work. So , who deserve more ? Of course that is my oldest bother because he's not a idle men .

Many people who doesn't work , They don't deserve nothing they are just a idle people. In many states , cities , and countries theres people who do not like to work they just do nothing all times . If they work they probability just work for couple of the month . How Tomas Jefferson said "" Determine never be a idle ""

People may think that persons who do not like to work are not good idea to be like a idle. Also many people may think that they maybe just don't have a huge responsibilities or they just their mothers giving then money for survey. And many people said that's really bad for keeping theirs sons that way .

In my opinion, Every people in the world is different , People we went to the university thats great because that way they can get a great jobs . And also people who did not go to the university, they also can get a greats jobs. and thats good , I think that people who do not work it just because maybe when they were young they parents did not teach them to be responsible. And now that they are adult they do not like to work , And that kind of people is always we they parents living in theirs houses.

In conclusion, Lets put in practice what Tomas Jefferson said "" Determine never be a idle "" Many people said lets do something with are life . We don't have to be idle .                  "
898,451321E506A6,"I think students doing home assignments will not benefit the student, because it doesn't help the student grasp the same kind of concepts like other students that do go to school.

The reason why I personally don't like home schooling is because if I'm at home I wouldn't get my work done. I'd be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because I'm not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldn't have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When you're home schooled you're mostly self-taught.

One other reason why I wouldn't reccommend home schooling is because you're not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner.

I think home schooling is a bad idea is because he wouldn't get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly effect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and axiety. If the parent loses their patience the child would start to act up on them. For all of these reasons home schooling is not a good idea. "
890,44B06B4A6D7E,"Schools offer distant learning as an option for student's who likes work from home, can there be good or bad benefits from working at home?. I think that working at home would not benefit student's, reason being home is more comfortable and relaxing .Working at a public school can help you get opportunity's with friend's or teacher's like a job or college career. Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer . Staying after school is a big benefit to people who prefer public school because you can get work done that is needed, but at home I feel like you can't get the same help you need on the work.

Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. Working from home can be challenging for some people because home is more comfortable therefore the student would become more lazy and get bad grades. One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. Students who work at home would have no one to help them out with work outside of class which would be hard on the student

Students who go to public schools will benefit more then the students that work at home. Public schools bring more opportunity's as distant learning would not get as many . This issue could be solved depending on the student, some students like to be at home and some like to go to public schools . Public schools help student's with college information and helps the student choose his path in life. Working in a public school environment, helps more students do better in there classes makes them more productive. "
2805,CCEFC4392340,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is.

The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year.

The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year.

Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they don't forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year.

In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke."""
148,0B478E81218B,"People should go seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters because a lot of people in this world are very isolated, like they are always to themselves, sometimes you can notice when people are going through things. People always need somebody to be by their side, it's not good to stay isolated it could make you go crazy. Fifty percent of all people go through depression, anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns because there's nobody there to help them, sometimes when you try to help they just either ignore you or they just don't want to be spoken too that means they haven't been seeking help. A person who has a companion can be going through things too you know, but they express themselves to their best friend but for more help you can talk to your specialist doctor. Doctors and authorities are really a good help, they hear you out and always agree with you. Experts should be people who are very close to you it could be a neighbor, family relative, family members, your boss, coworkers and even your friends.

Authorities sometimes don't really help you when your having mental breakdowns because sometimes they don't care or it's not their business. Life is way bigger than you think, don't take it for granted always be grateful that your living to this day. The Environment should be peaceful, calming and not to over dramatic always be positive in your life don't let anybody bring you down, Life is important, live it up to the best, In other places like work or school always express yourself usually at work you ideas but your not show if you should share them, don't be shy share your thoughts on new things. Sometimes at work it's hard for you to share what you are thinking even at school, a lot of people have to over think their ideas because they think it's not good enough, that makes them lose precious time because time is usually short and you need all the time you can get, it's better to go seek help because your struggling to think of a good idea.

Most of the people in this world are really good at making their own decisions because they have nothing really to worry about, they like to be independent and always get things done quicker that way. For some people it's really not that easy for them to get their work done because they have a huge struggle in their life, they need the help, but sometimes they don't ask because they don't want embarrass themselves in front of others that work independently. Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and equal, the world needs to open their eyes sometimes because a lot of people are taking their life because they don't receive they need, day and night, sixty percent of people in this world work hard to live, they work hard to cover your monthly bills, groceries, clothes and gas if they have a car. People who make low income deserve a big chance so they can maintain themselves, when you in situation like that look for people you know and ask what they work for, it might match what like to do. People who are struggling to maintain rent and other important things they can always seek for government assistance.

People are living in this world for a reason, they need to survive and live their life. Everybody got to do what they got to do sometimes when it comes to surviving, there is a lot of single family dad's and mom's in this world, most of the time they can't even maintain their kids and home. It's a good idea to always have someone in your life they motivate you and care for you, they do much more because their here for you no matter the situation, Always have help beside you, you will need it. A lot of people who are alone and make their own decisions, don't have families and friends, they just rather do their way because they know what they are doing. Not everyone is the same, everyone has different problems and they usually go through them alone, sometimes they don't know how to think and how to live. At the end of the day there has to be someone out there that can help you with your life, your never alone always remember that. Some people who try their hardest usually pays off even though they go through struggles but they have to be independent sometimes thats how you learn to be responsible and no one is always there to hold your hand sometimes you got to give it your all, just believe in yourself over time you will succeed"
578,2BE976C99FDF,"Many people like Philosopher's are stating Information which comes from there head and believe Its right; For people to look at and assume It Is right and agree because of what position that person has such as a Philosopher,Physician, and a Humanitarian. This Philosopher,Albert Schweitzer illustrates that an ""Example Is not the main thing In influencing others;It Is the only thing."" Although setting an example by your own behavior Is a good way to Influence other's; Their's still better and different way's to Influence people. Not all people have bad behaviors because of somebody close to them; A son could be a good and humble and the people around him could only have negativity.

There are different ways such as sitting down with someone and giving advice about good behavior and what their currently doing wrong In the present. Schools even teach about It and have group of students learn about whats good and bad. In health class they are teaching about having a healthy life to be prepared in life and for whats coming In the future. Although there are example's out there like famous people that motivate others to go the same path they went,Also a good example but those are not the only way's; There are teachings or parents giving advice to have a better behavior,psychologists who people can tell whats going on in their life and they get a response of what they can do.

Somebody,Anybody can demonstrate they were a good example to somebody but at the end not everybody turns out to be like them. A son can be good and humble while the people close to him or that he admires have a lot of negativity. Anybody could sit down with somebody and talk about about what there doing wrong and they could be doing the same thing;That dose not make them a good example but at least they give advice,ideas, and reveals to that person a new pathway they can take to do better. Teachers who teach about It can fill them with information they didnt know about having a healthy life; That teacher could be doing everything wrong and be negative which makes her a bad example to everybody but the students get the good advice to be better.

There are people who leave good examples for others to follow but is It also the only thing. Because there are other ways to influence other people such as giving advice and teaching, while that person who gives It Is a bad example but the person who receives It follows the good advice not there bad example."
899,451A840C382E,"yes i am agree with Emerson statement: if we attempt to do something in our life to make a better life or what we have already otherwise we will never Develope.

what kind of attempting we have to do for development? we need to have education for development that we can make our life better.

we can start our education from beginning of our life which is called school, college, university, and etc.

we should learn and keep our education in these places until we reach to our goal and success.

education is a best option for us that we can know everything, make our mistake correct, and we try to receive our diploma as soon as possible by hard studying, and every day learning the new things base on our life.

we should looking for the way that we can grow our self and do not lose our opportunity in during our life.

education is a process of life can grow your mind to better know about new stuff. this is a chance probably happen for one time, but it doesnt matter whenever you get it. basically when the students finish these process,

they will graduate, and then they will gain their diploma from any of those places after that, they will become a educated person with a high careers in their society.

although, some of the people dont like studying, or maybe they dont want it, they are preferring work careers instead of education."
1355,68392F53B9D7,"I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best'' because not everyone always learns from their mistakes,the problem may have already affected them,the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everyone learns from there mistakes. some people cannot remember if they had a mistake a long time ago and that mistake comes up again, for example, my brother had failed his drivers test and when he took it again he failed again. Furthermore, when your nervous and you had a problem, Some people get trauma and they think of that problem and they are afraid of doing it again, For example, I missed a tackle at football once and I was scared of doing it again, so when I had the chance of doing it again I thought about if i would miss it like last time.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because the problem may have had already affected them so they would not be able to change it. some people may have made a really big mistake so they would not be able to be the best if they have had that chance. For example, somebody on the news had the death penalty for murder so they would not be able to change that. Furthermore, people have had the opportunity to get something great but they chose not to, they cannot go back and change that. for example my sister got this award but she refused to take it so she cant go back.

I disagree with the saying ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best'' because the way to be successful in life is to hardly have any mistakes. A lot of people had had many mistakes in their life and failed to achieve their goal, for example, my cousin wanted to be a lawyer but then had a lot of problems with what she was doing so she quit law school. when people have a lot of mistakes they tend to get more mistakes and then they end up trying to figure out how to deal with all them. for example, I was taking a test and I tried to figure out some of the questions at once but then I ended up mixing all of them up.

In conclusion,I disagree with the quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" because not everybody can acknowledge what do do after they have made a mistake, the problem may have already have had a negative impact on them already, And the way to be great is to rarely have any mistakes"
2112,9E817DB62497,"Are outdoor activities enjoyable? Outdoor activities are enjoyable for everyone people can play outside with they're friends and get a chance to meet some new friends. There are so many activities someone can do. They are a lot of sports people can play soccer, football, baseball and the list keep on going. outdoor activities are good exercise for everyone for the soul reason of doing something outdoors than doing nothing indoors people are getting more lazy and stupider by the day because of technology humans wast most of they're lives on technology than the outdoors. The outdoors activities help people to get more active. Outdoor activities on any season and weather. If it is winter and snowy it's a great time to go ice skating or snow boarding. If it is summer and hot then it's a great time to go swimming and it is a great time to head to the beach and go swimming on the ocean or to play sand valley ball. Then fall is a good time to throw a football around or to kick a soccer ball around. Spring is a good time to play soccer go running and to go bicycling.

What is some of your favorite activities? My favorite activity is soccer. I love play soccer because everyone can play soccer is easy to learn and it is simple to play. One thing about soccer is that it can be played at any time on any weather if it is snowy, hot, cold, and rainy. The best time to play soccer is on the spring because the weather is not to cold but not to hot it is just perfect to go outside and kick a ball or to play with friends. Then the trees and the plants look beautiful because they are growing during the spring. The outdoors is fun and enjoyable there are so many activites some can do so try some of them out. "
3317,E587CBD5D1E4,"How we know the first impression is important and not always it's impossible to change it with our actions, and attitude, it depends of the situation.

Sometimes the first impression can be good. For example if I going to meet my girlfriend parents or if I go to meet my friend parents I need to have a good appearances to give a good impression but we can have a good impression but that can change. However if we do bad things like with our girlfriend if we treat bad her the parents are going to have a bad impression and that can change or with our friend if we don't help or if we give bad adviser to him the parents can think bad about us even if the first time we get a good impression.

Sometimes the first impression can be bad. For example in a job interview, during the interview if we don't use the correct language or if we go with bad aspect we can't get the job. However even if I give a first bad impression that will change if in the same interview we use a good language and if we respond the answer properly that can help you and finally in my own interview a give a bad aspect but I use the correct language in the interview and I get the job that's why I think that can help you in a interview when you get a bad impression.

In conclusion the first impression not always It's impossible to change if we know how to deal with it."

Ways I show intelligence are by performing clever tasks, giving good ideas or advice, or teaching other people how to be intelligent like me. A way I show intelligence is by giving good ideas or advice when there is a problem. Another way of showing intelligence is learning something quickly. I always learn and understand stuff because I am very intelligent. I can also teach someone else something if they don't know it. Teaching other people is easy because I very intelligent. These are some ways of how and why I am intelligent.

Ways I show my talents are by showing my special abilities, intelligence, and being athletic

I am very talented in a lot of different ways. I show my special abilities in school by using my brain to solve problems. It is easier because I am intelligent. Since I am intelligent, I can solve any type of problem. I can solve the ones not even teachers can solve because I am intelligent. I am also very athletic. I like to play sports and do excercise. These are some ways I show my talents.

I show my abilities of being athletic by playing sports, doing excercise, and running. I love to play sports. You can have fun and do excercise at the same time. I also like to run. It is a good way to excercise. Finally I like to do excecise. It is a good waty to lose weigth, lose calories and get fit. This is why I like to do excercise

2960,D457F3AEAC6D,"I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchhill without failure how can we humans excied in life to get to success? To prove my statement i will provide two reasons, and also two examples, explaining why i believe that failure can lead humans to a world we couldnt imagine it could exiest.

Reason number one would be Battles and Wars. I believe that losing Battles and Wars help us the united states of america create new weapons wither it was nuclear or bullets. Another reason why i say that is because without losing those battles and wars how wouldve we found out about atomic bombs or harden steel bullets. It sounds crazy and highly dishorroable to are fallen heros who were killed in action, but if we won wars and battles everytime we would soon fall. Because we keep using the same positions and plans in order to win, and we also would feel too confident in wining so we will be using the same weapons over and over again and let the other team discover those new atomic weapons.

Reason number two is about automobles. Automobles have been around for a very long time now i guess if my calculations are right its been almost 1,500 years since Henrey Ford showed the world his first ever automoble, the Model T. Henrey Ford had to go through so many people doubting his Model T project would work. Day by day, month by month, even year after years of failed experments. But in the spring of 1830 he successfully got one fully working and running. He had to go through so much walls blocking his path in order to show the world that a automoble was and still is possible. Another example would be Tesla. The famous electronic car company to power there cars with electricity. those guys mustve gone through so many experments that i cant even imagine and the amout of failed ones too and im pretty sure there is alot more failed test projects than passed ones. I say that to be reasonable about it not saying it to make fun of them because if they didnt fail the first time the first modles would have been super crappy, like the cars would suck. Because after every failed project you get new ideas and new imagines of how you want the car to repersent the company and have a good repuation. So if failure wasnt an option for these two companys the cars of 2020 wouldve sucked so much because the company will only car about the money and just send running crappy looking cars that we humans have as a need for work and family.

Those are my last two thoughts about failure and Wisten Churchill isn't wrong at all. Without failure succces would feel like nothing like if it was pointless. And we wouldnt live the world we live in today if it wasnt for people back then who didnt stop failing until they reached succesed."

Every body need to know that the Word ''Idle'' is something bad, because sometimes is annoying. Some people are Idles and that is no good. When we are idles others people sees us like anormal people. If I disturb a lot in class I can look like a anormal person.

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". And imagination will always be apart of us we grew up having our little or big imagination's how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas,or any of those type of things ,and superheros. without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is.

Also,

having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

In conclusion, i agree with this statement "" imagination is more important than knowledge "" because for those given reasons like the one about us as kids we would use our imagination and how we would use it for ourselves and the other given example for the blind people how they have that throughout there life spam. therefore those are my reasons i agree with the given statement."

Some people believe that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is not the greatest accomplishment because not following what the world wants can make a big impact on a persons life; however, to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something is the greatest accomplishment because Being able to be someone who the person is not suppose to be can bring success into a persons life, not letting people influence a person characteristics is a big accomplishment, having to be someone who a person wants to become can show the person full capability

Being able to be someone who the person is not suppose to be can bring success into a persons life. Being different can isolate someone from the society and this can change a persons life choice. A person who think and act different can have another way of facing problems in life which makes them different from other people.

Not letting people influence a person characteristics is a big accomplishment. Being who the persons wanna be can give someone originality. The person can act freely and become who it wants to be also they do not have to worry about peer pressure.

Having to be someone who a person wants to become can show the person full capability. The person do not have to worry about what others think of whats it can do. Acting as what the persons not suppose to be can give a big advantage in creativity.

Some people believe that being someone that you're not can is not the greatest accomplishment because this can make a big impact in someones life; however, showing who you really are is one of the biggest accomplisment in a persons life becase acting different can lead to success, being different means the persons have full control over their actions, having to be someone who a person wants to become can show the person full capability. To be someone that a persons dont want to become is complete fine because this shows that no body is limiting the person from being who they really are."
2604,C15EC5707409,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. I do not agree, with this model by extending the school day two hours. I Think my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours, because two more hours of school will be very streful for students and students will not have the enought time to do their homeworks after school. On the other hand this would be a big problem for schools.

In first place, I think this will be a big disadvantage for studets who have others responsiblity to do after school. For example, I have a job after school and I need to be there at four oclock, but if my school follow this model I wouldn't keep my job, because school will finish two ahours late and it will be very late for me to go to work. This show, that if school follow this model this really will affect me and not only me- but also other students who, also have to work after school.

Second, two more ahurs of school will be very streful for students, because classes will be longers than what they usually are, so students will get tired and they will not concentrate in what the teacher is saying. Also students will not have the enought time to do their homework after school, becuase they will get very late and tired at home and they will not feel like to do their homework, knowing that they need to rest for the next day of school. With this in mind, students, also will be affecting with their grades, for the reason that they will not turn in their homeworks.

Some say, if schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours, would be a big problem for students attendance because students will not show up to every single day of school, for the reason that they will be tired from the day before of school. Therefore follow this model would not be a good idea to deal with, because attendance is something very important that schools require to students can pass their school year.

In the final analysis, this rutine will not be easy for students to face, even know that there is going to be only for day of school, for me this still not a good idea to agree with. As a student that I am this would affect me in my daily rutine. Students will be very streful and tired during class. This would affect the students attendence which, also will affect their grades.  "
3216,E12401B92C3B,"Some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. Even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. Everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. I disagree with what Albert Schweitzer said. In fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently.

To begin it is difficult being a good example. Everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. For example: I do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. My aunts explain them that I am a good example in my family because I have two jobs and I go to school and in my free time I prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. I know the things they say are correts but I told them do not use me as an explample because now I am like that, but if tomorrow I decide to quit school or I do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. Some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but I know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too.

Next is better if we influence them differently. Not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. For example: I have an aunt who had her first kid at her 14 years old. Now she is 30 years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. She tells to my cousins and I that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. She remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. Later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. Now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. My aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. Some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not right in the past, but I believe that we learn from those mistakes but still we are not the best example because we already did bad things.

In conclusion being an example of our own behabior is not the best way to influence people! There are many different ways to influence others as you know it is difficult being a good example and is better to influence people diferently. There are many occacions where we recognize that we do great jobs in life, and people have to see us like good examples. However; people can see us like good examples but not to exaggerate because some people think that just because they do something good they are the best. And I know they can think that because every single minute in our life is count it and also challenged, and we do not want to waste our time."
2942,D390FE972D8F,"Changing the cafeteria food's to healthier options is a good idea because, it shows kids new variety of food's they never tried before, and it makes kids have a balance between food's when they eat.

Changing the menu is going to give kids a better experience and have a open mind to foods they never ate before. Once they try it at school and realize how much they like it there most likely going to eat healthier on a daily basis which is going to help there diet and help there body become bigger and stronger.

When kids go out to eat or are eating at home there going to have a better balance between when they should eat junk food and when they should eat healthy. When they eat dinner at home there going to have more on their plate than just the main dish there going to have vegetables fruits everything because they've tried that fruit or vegetable before and they know they like it. Kids will also see that they like a different combination of food with there vegetable or fruit.

So changing the cafeteria lunch menu to healthier options is a good idea, kids will have a better diet and will have better options when picking out what food to eat for the day. Kids will also start having an open mind to a different varieties of food.    "
3440,EBEFF43F46EE,"If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because I'd always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. I know that college is a long time away for me but it's coming sooner than I think. Before I know it I'm going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like I'm successful I need to finish college. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful.

The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what

I need to know in order to get my dream job. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesn't mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer won't come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I can't just have a high school diploma. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams.

The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didn't see the point of even attending in the first place. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. One thing she never got to do was finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I don't give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.

In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day there's one thing that I want to accomplish the most. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college."
3426,EB0F373C1D2A,"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school.

Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves.

What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student can't get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long.

All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies. "
2743,C9B989E27414,"Some people said that haveing a positive actitude is the key to success in life? How do we know this and, how can we demostrate this on real life, well here I have three examples of how to be a positive person it help me to be success in life.

In my first year as a freshman i was a lonely and boring person I didn't talk to any body, i was dumb I remember that i used to had a really good teacher her name was Generic_Name, i remember that i was bad with her and know i just want to aplogize with her, my point in here is that if my attitude was positive in that time thingscould be different in many ways and thats why i decide to chenge my attitude.

In my second year I decide to talk with more people and be positive person and because of that I star to have new friends and more teachers like me and when a teacher likes you they help you more and thats a small way to show that have a positive actitude is the key in life, and because i'm not a smart student, that extra help that the teachers give me, it help me to pass my classes.

In my third year, well it was pretty fun because when I change into a positive attitude i got new frinds and when i was in problems they help me, like i losse my pencil they borrow me one, or when i miss my bus they give me a ride to my home or they give me a number of a bus that is close to my house, when i was apsent they ask for my missing work so they can give it to me.

In conclution the positive attitude is the key in life because it makes you friendly and more people like you because of that. "

Job opportunities and getting notice by important people are opportunities that come with having an affirmative attitude. This kind of posture can benefit ones future.

If more individuals convey a positive attitude many would have better employment opportunities. Jobs can help you be successful. Working for the president of the United States is a more beneficial job then working a regular nine to five. Showing an affirmative attitude can help you work for the president and can also help you have a better income which can lead to success. Having a good occupation is important.

Since it's important to have a positive image it can expand the people you meet. One way is by having a confident posture. This helps you have a better chance of engaging with significant people like the president. This attitude can lead one to have job opportunities.

Looking at the other side being negative can also help you be successful in life. One example is by being selfish. Putting yourself first in everything you do can lead to success. With this negative image shows that your the most important person that can only bring you a favorable outcome.

As many have stated displaying confidence is the way to go in life. Employment opportunities and getting noticed by important individuals can bring success. With most success theres always positive results. Obviously one should always be positive if they want a desirable outcome in life because life is too short to be unsuccessful and negative. "
526,2844FD2BF83B,"I don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home.

Reasons

1-difficult.

2-Get distracted.

3-confused.

First i don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home. It can be hard if they don't undertand something. Is not the same the class in the computer to have a tecacher explaining you. If you have a question it's difficult to ask to the computer unlike to ask to a teacher.

Second i don't think students would be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. If they get lazy they can say they going to take the class later. if they want to watch a movie they going to forge thinks about the class. They can get distracted for anything like the phone,music,and the TV.Attend class from home would not benefit students if they want to hang out with their frinds they can leave the class in any moment unlike if they have a teacher giving the the class in the school they can respect the class,put more antention,and understand better the class.

Third i don't think students would be benefit to attend class from home they can get confused with the class. if the take the class online they can read the direction but sometimes even reading the directions students get confused.

is better to attends the classes in the school so a teacher can help students with anything students will need. teachers have the experience to explain students what they need to do about the class. attend classes online students basically are alone so is more confused to understand the class. in school if students get confused they can ask to someone else to understand. at home they dont have anybody so they have to think alot to understand. attend classes from home can affect students grades for less knowledge about the class unlike in the schools they have many opportunities to learn better.

In conclusion students would not be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. It can be more difficult to them to undertand the classes. they can get confused with things about the class for not have a teacher with them personality to be helping them to undertand the class."
2983,D610B092DAD9,"If you where a high schooler would you know what you would want you'er career to be ? Some say that students are expected to know to the career that they want to have so that they take specific class for that career. So that it could help them acive or get closer to the career that they want.

All though some say that high schools students should not be expected to know what specifice career they want. Frist peopel tented to chang over time so somthing that you might have liked three years ago you might not like that much anymore. Second you cant really telll if you like somthing intell you try it. Lets say that Generic_Name has wanted to be a teacher her whole life but then she gets the job and finds out that she is not that happy with her job and that she should have tryed other class in high school. Finaly most student dont really think about thier careers intill the last two years of high school.

actuily all students should know what they want thier career to be by the time they are in high school. Frist if student where to know what they want there career to be they could take specific class for that career. By students not having to take other class that they dont need it would help them focuse more because they whouldnt have to worry about having to take or study for a test in a class that they dont need. Finally if a student was to be taking class that he/she wants they would show up to class more because they would be intersteded.

Thats why I belive that students should know what career they want when they get into high school. Because it would help them out and even make thier life esay. Even if that idea was to chang but it all ways good to have a goal so that you can acive it."
2300,ABA60F0BD289,"How can you build self-esteem. self-esteem comes from achievement. Student's are confident when they have completed their work and their goals' has been reached. achieving work and goals build self-esteem because they learn how to have confidence, self- respect, and achieving goals.

When students have confidence is important because they can turn in their work with out thinking about getting a bad score, Students can put their best effort in their work and they have confidence they'll have a good score. when students have confident they want to participate more in class do class activities, Students having confidence is important because they can have a positive mindset and they have that confidants to teach other.

Students having self-respect is important because they learn how to respect them selves and others, when self-respecting they think about what they are going to say before they talk sometimes students didn't mean to say it in a wrong way do they make them selves look bad and others start making fun of them. when we have self-respect we learn how respect our decision how to talk with manners.

Setting up goals is important because you build off the skills you already know and getting better. when i was in art class i kept getting bad grades and i never thought that i was going get better at drawing, but I set myself a goal to get better at drawing go i started practicing everyday and started to build off my skills and eventually i get better at it. Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because it's showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine

As you have read self-esteem is build off by effort, achieving goals and having self-respect is how you get better . only when we have self-esteem students learn better in classes because they will putting more effort on activities in school be more confident with answers and not be shy about getting it wrong students learn from studying or from their mistakes."
836,40331978F344,"When creating movies, games, or any other art, its a good idea to get advice from others instead of just one person, first off, its a good strategy to make your work more diverse, makes it more appealing, and more opinions is better than one.

First off, when creating art, its important to get advice from others, but the more you get, the more clearer and more diverse it becomes. They can tell you if you messed up and why. They can give you ideas to make characters to fill in the gaps, They can also help expand the story.

Second off, If you want to seem as appealing as possible, you should ask people for what they want and work with them. If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion.

Lastly, the more opinions you have, the more messages your art will have. One person isnt enough to give enough opinions. instead of just one opinion, you should have multible opinions so you can give your art a message. listening and getting feedback from multible sources will help you and your art in conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback."
182,0DF2006FC8F1,"Dear principal, i think that bringing phones to school is ok as long as we don't use them during class time. Me STUDENT_NAME is telling you to please let use the phones during free times because how about if we have an emergence and we need to call our mom or dad and we cant communicate with them. It would be very hard for use because we also have to have our own time to communicate with others in case something bad happens, So im telling you if we can please use our phones in lunch, nutrition or in other free times. We the students have to have the free time to. But we also have to be careful on not be using the phone during class time to. If we do then you can cancel the policy but if we actually do good we can continue with it. You never know, we might even do good in this and we can keep on doing it but if we fail, You can stop it. I'm telling you to just give us a chance to see if it dose work out."
2975,D594B486E6B5,"People that have their faces in front of a screen with there back slouching with the help of technology. Technology is advancing year by year and month by month. When teens or adults get there hands on the new technology they will spend weeks or even months in their rooms, trying to figure out what the device can and cannot do. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives, because it can lead to bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive.

However, not everyone agrees with this statement. Some people claim that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. Neverless, this position overlooks an important point, mainly that technology cannot change how much human contact you have or do not have. For example, my friend she cannot drive, but she can have items get delivered to her; books, food, and clothes. Furthermore, when the delivery person came she did not know the proper way to greet him. Do to technology, people can have bad communication skills and they don't know how to communicate with people when they are in contact with someone.

Moreover, by being isolated, technology can lead to bad communication skills. When someone gets the newest device or game, they want to know how it works. By learning what the device or video game can and cannot do, they usually spend a month learning how the device works or how to unlock the next level in the game. For instance, my brother got a new video game, he has isolated himself in his room, so he can beat the level and go on to the next. When he was finish with the level, he had a hard time communicating properly. Before he played his video game, his grammar was good; now it wasn't. For example he would use the wrong past and present tense. Thus, by staring at the screen for so long, he has got very inactive.

Additionally, sitting on the couch or in a chair with a screen in front of you, every day for a whole month can make a person inactive. People that are inactive can become very lazy, and they intend on making a lot of mistakes when they are talking. They can also gain weight or have health problems. To illustrate, sitting in front of a screen while eating junk food can cause you to gain weight and can lead to health issues. During spring break, my friend had nothing to do, he was on his laptop everyday eating junk food.

Now he has to be careful on what he can and cannot eat, because he will get heart burn.

If he does not stop eating unhealthy foods in front of a screen he will gain more weight and have more health issues.

He does not know how to ask for help; he needs someone to push him to go outside and enjoy the weather, instead of being in front of a screen all day long.

Based on this argument, one must conclude that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on peoples lives. Technology can effect us in many different ways; bad communication skills, health problems and being inactive. In conclusion, technology can change human contact in a negative way."
3907,FFD9A83B0849,"Working alone, students do not have to argue with other about decission of their proyects and have to work with someone they do not know; however, most students prefer to work as a group because students are able to dived work, to share ideas and to help each other. Working with a group allows students to work more efficiently. Personally and due to the facts, I would prefer to work with a group because working with other is more beneficial for students.

Firstly. Most students are required to do many proyects during each marking period which is to much for each student, and specially when there is a big proyect for each class that worth 10% of the period's grade, but working with a group the proyect might be diveded to each person in the group, and share between them. Each student have different and unique qualities that can be helpful to do do certain parts of proyects that for other can be difficult to do.

Secondly. Working with a group might be also seen as opportunity for student of gaining values of cooperation which is important to have due to many companies assign jobs to two or more people to realize them because of the different knowledges they can provide to each other. Companies usually use the phrase:

""Work as a team""

to make their productivity more efficiently. Teachers should see this as way of helping students to get expiriences of working as team, and also that way, we as students would get knowledge of others.

By allowing students to work with group teacher might be helping student to get more confident about their due to the fact that students can disscuss betweend eache other the topics and loook forward the best way of doing them. Schools are allowing students to stay after school which is perfectly fine for those students that are not able to go to a house of one the members of the group. A group might be also helpful for those students that are having issues turning their work on time because; now, they can get be supported by other and be more productive.

To conclude, No students should be in the position of having a big proyect with no enough time without the opportunity of work with a groups. Many companies are assigning jobs to be done by more than one person, they know that a team works more efficiently than one person, and teachers should do the same in their classes to help students to get their grades up, and also to be productive on turning work in. Working with a group should be allowed for students during classes to improve their qualities of coorperation and to have different points of view to do the best for subject."

3667,F60545D8271E,"I think that schools must have a after school homework club because students who are having difficulty in school can get extra help from teachers, students could improve their grades, and teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs.

The first reason I think that schools must have an after school homework club is because students who are having difficulty in class can get extra help form their teachers and students.

One time

I had trouble understanding how to answer the questions my teacher gave to me about the civil war 2 years ago, and my teacher said that I could stay after school in the homework club and to meet her their.

That was the reason how I understood how to answer the questions on the quiz.

That is one reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

The second reason why I think that schools must have a after school homework club is so students could improve their grades in their classes.

One time I had a D in my science class because I needed more help with remembering the parts of a cell.

My science teacher then told me that I could stay after school and go to the homework club with her to practice on the parts of a cell.

One week later my grade went up to a B because my teacher helped me pass my test.

This is the second reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

The third reason why I think that schools should have a after school homework club is so teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs.

One time I stayed after school for the homework club and a teacher was having a heard time explaining a question to a student who spoke Spanish.

The teacher asked me if I could translate what she is saying to the student.

the teacher and I both helped the student understand the question.

This is the third reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

In conclusion, these are the three reasons why I think that schools must have a after school homework club."
2561,BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances,

football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy."
3730,F893E9ED1F0C,"Should school have to add one and half hours to each day? I disagree because student have to do stuff after school like some student have practice for sports and more. Another reasons why I disagree is because student might not like school and it can get boring. Something else why I disagree is because parents might want you after school for something and if you come from school late them can't do what your parents are telling u want to do.

Some reasons why I disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. Something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs. Another reason why is because some students have family things to do out of school and it would be for a long time. Some student would have doctor appoints and that is very important.

Another reasons why I disagree is because student will get bored in school. Some student can start to get mad try to leave the school and get in trouble and the student can get in a fight. Something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer. Something is that they would not be able to learn if they fall asleep.

Last reasons why I disagree is because parents might need their child after school for something. There parents might need them to help clean them clean there house. If they need to tell them something important. Another reason why is because there parents might need help to buy food for there house. Some parents might not like that because they would not be able to see there child for a long time.

That why I disagree because school is just for certain time it not all day. Some student will get bored and not want to come school again. They might have thing to do after school like sports and practices or other thing. Some student parent might need help from there child and would want to see them more time not for a little while. That why I disagree that we should not have add and half hours to each day.                                                                       "
3080,DAECE15EE507,small act of kindness can impact on other by showing that you care about others. And even though you don't show a lot of kindness even a little bit change on the other person because of the kindness that you were showing. If you think showing kindness is a waste don't think that because showing some kindness can show the other person that you care about them. Also you can think that not showing enough kindness is bad then you wrong because even just a little bit can show yourself and the other person that you care and that you nice. Even though your not the type of person to show kindness to others can change about what the other person thinks about you like maybe the person thinks oh like this person doesn't care about me. But when the person show kindness can change the option on what the person is thinking about you. And if your the person that is always nice and you think your not good enough because you think that you don't show enough kindness just know if you say something nice or show thats kindness. In conclusion this is why i think showing small act of kindness can impact on others.
1115,56579FB8A60B,"When you have a goal, No matter how long it takes, and you complete, it will be the greatest accomplishment.

To be yourself in this world that is changing over and over, you have to have a strong mind, a lot of people will not be agree with what you have to do in your life, But people over think everything people say, if you want to go more higher than where you are; you will have to make some decisions in your life to make those greatest accomplishment that you want to finish and get to the top.

I agree with this statement, because the time passes in your life is going with it, the more you do the more you get and that is what people don't get, if you want to make accomplishments in your life you have to worked out man, For example Lebron James how do you think he went where he is now, Making steps in his life, goals, family help, you have all of it it is right there you just have to get it.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""... honestly I will not take it like is changing you, because you are the one changing your life, yes you will be seeing stuffs you will make some errors but that is how you are going to reach what you want in life. you are going easy you will get it easy and you will get it shipper too, if you work hard at the first time, at the end it will come easy and you will be thanks full.

A great accomplishment?, That can be anything, every one is a world, what I mean by that is that every mind have the power to do what it have to be done, either a teacher, family, friends, they are just telling you where is the door, your friends are not going to opened for you, not your parents or teachers, you are the one who will opened if you want to do it and get out, and get that goal or accomplishment that you have to complete.

I can be a example for this, I used to hate school a lot, i went tot his time that i didn't wanna even go there, but there was this English 10 teacher that just speaking with me one day just one day, yes I was having F at that moment, after all that thinking a lot about what she said I passed her class at the end with a B, not knowing that I was going to be able to do it, but I did it just doing what i have to do, like I said people can just tell you where is the door you have to go get it.

""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", yes it is; put your self together get all the help you need if they are good person they will help you, staying quit you will not get it, asking for help will not make you smaller it will make you stronger, and that is what we need be strong and get that goal or accomplishment done thanks."
867,42587039161D,"Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house.

Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons.

So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay.

3736,F8F503B765DA,"i say that we shoudn't have more hours of school , because it will just make us be more sterssed b working. we wil barly have free time to o what t do but more time time in school wil make us tired and weak we will need more food. it will cost the school more food and it wil cost more money and light to wast on teaching. Kids won't learn because they are going to say why did they put more school time and thats all they are going to say the the whole time. It will make it all more busy for the teachers they will get mad and say how they can't do that much hours they got kids they got thing to take care of.

The school will need to whas't more money on food and electicion bill just for one more hour of education and kids won't even learn alote because they will be to busy complaining and say that they want to go home. the school board will just was't money for no reason. school is doing good already so do not mess it up by an hour of school. The teacher will work more time ,so they will get paid more. So if u do put one more hour of school if a kid needs to stay after would they stay an other hour of school that would mean that the teacher would gets a bigger pay cheack and that would be alote of students so teachers would have to stay for ciuds to so that would be longer and by the time its done it will be dark.

The school will need more volnenters because they don't want to pay teachers more already because they already do because they have an other hour of school left so they will have to beg the teachers to volnter to to stay. School will need to think of more thing to do in the school to fill up the hour.

we will not want to go to school. we will be so tired and and to know that we have an other hour of school i would be done for the day. I would not feel like going to school every day because i would be more tired . it will give me less free time to us because we got sleep earlyer because we are tired.

we will get mad because we don't got free time alote and that would effect our school day. Kids will feel that school is to much work and might tell there parents and the parents might tell the school to lower it down. The school will will get complans form parents that there kid is stressing to much so that would be bad and school will have to cancil the one hour. Thats why i think it is a bad idea to put one more hour of school all of the people will disagree i would to because it will just make me stressed out and give less free time. I think school should leave the hours alone since they don't have to deal with the work and tired ness they don't have to think twice.

I think it is dumb to add an hour more because it can mess up every thing. If every thing is doing good then it should stay like that if we need to change it we should all chose if we want a to have one more hour or not. We are the important voteers so why leave us out of it. We are the ones who get tried ,so one more hour and 30 mintues is not good for are bodys even worse if you have after school or a clud. The money that you had to use for the extra time could go to better things like new computers for us. Or it could help for better lunches or better gym oqupment or mucic things and make the school better by painting it or somthing. Instead of was'ting it on one hour of paying teachers. I would like to have free time not streeing out about doing work and being done and haveing little free time. Thats why i think it would be better if we did not get one hour of school and just be the same."
2310,AC3111702C95,"First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. You will forgive and forget. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. People change and when they do, so do impressions.

Second chances are also very important with impressions. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble."
567,2B62F285FD21,"Its a good idea to have year-round school because you will not be out of school long that will make you forget what was just learned and will always have help from teachers all the time.

Being out of school for a long time can make students forget what was just learned and it's true because many kids have reported that they forgot what they have learned in that year of school. Shorter breaks is the way to go because you will be able to retain the information that the teacher taught last week. This is another advantage that you will have because students will be fresh and will have more time to learn and study for upcoming test and would probably even make them a better student.

Having a long break is desireable by all of the students but it can also be a negative thing, Thats why having year-round school can improve many things for an example it can improve your grades, better focus and understanding, and better opportunities in life. It will even make the school at one of the best schools to go because the percentage of passing scores, quality of learning, and the best teachers.

This will not just improve and make students better at school but can also give them opportunities and chances in life. Education is the most valuable thing in the world without it this world would of not had influential leaders and inventors. This can open new doors in life and it can make anyones dream career come true not mattering their race or class. Having year- round school is the answers to many solutions.

In my opinion we should make a difference and have year-round schools. We have to make our youth in America into one of the most successful and brightest because they are the future of this nation.

2623,C262F0931AA1,"This prompt is about some people that need help to make their own decisions or need someone to told what they need to do even in their personal life.

The question say "" should people make their omn decesions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?"" some people they will said that is better if someone as came and make there decisions in everything so, they don't need to worry about anything.

There are another person that think that is way to much because how someone that they don't know is gonna make their decisions and also the dicisions of their life.

This is a big topical because like I said before so many people can desagree with this but there are other that are agree with this,in my opinion I'm desagree with this becuause is my life and I need to leard how to deal with it. Even if my life is the worse one I going to take care of all my decesions sometimes we can ask at someone for a opinion maybe, because the person is more older then me but is only a opinion you're not gaving authorities at all at the person to go and make your decisions and then take care of all your stuff.

In my conclusion is better if you take care of your on stuff doesn't matter how hard that it, is your life and you are the only one that knows how to deal with everything that you have done so, this is my last decision people should make their own decisions. "
3463,ED06CD30103F,"Have you ever wondered when is it a good idea for people to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. They are many reasons why high school kids need to start thinking about what they want to do for a living. Im going to tell you why it is a good idea for high school kids to have a (an) idea of what they want to do for a living. However, some people think it's a bad idea for them to start thinking what they want to do for a living.

If people dont start knowing what they like at a young age then they will not know what the want to do in the future. We should start knowing what we want to do by the end of high school for many reasons. When we finish high school we should go straight to college so we can study about what we want to do. They're many people in the world that still dont know what they want to do; and that is because they didn't know what they want to do. You should always know what you want to do for a living once your out of high school.

People in high school only think about living life and not thinking about what they want to do fro their life. They're many people in high school (including me) that just want to live life with out a job and just got party. Life doesn't for that way. If you want to work at McDonald, Burger king, etc the you won't be able to party like you want. All your going to do is work, work, and work all day. If you start think about what you want to do for a living right now, then when your older you wont be working all day. You will be able to take a vacation or have time with your family.

Some people think that if you wait until your an adult to know what you want to do, then its better, but thats not what I think. You should know what you want to do by the end of high school. Then when your older, like in your 50s or 60s then you can retire and not bust your butt of working at a minimum wage job for your whole life. Thats my reasons why I think its better to know what you want to do for a living once your in high school."
1489,7302457525D4,"I think some student take a class at home because they live to far or they not have any transportation however the students can study for video or for online, but I think that is not benefit because it most better to learn more going to the school, for example the teacher they wants to theirs students learned but something they can put a lot homework because they want to their students learned however some student they live to farm from the school but they take the bus or they take the train and another transportation because they want a do something on the future, but is not bad idea to the students take class on the home because everyone wants to do something on the future for example if you someone wants to do something on the future they need to going to the school or take class for online becuase the school very important however not everybody have the same opportunities.

But I think the online class is not benefit for the students because they can not learn better maybey the students they can not consentrate good at home becuase they distrate for something and they cannot learn about the lesson and maybe the teachers they cannot teach good however on the schools the students they cannot distrate and they put attention when the teachers theach the lesson better however they force the students to put attention because the teacher wants their students learned.

However some people they don't have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

The school is very important but some students doest like the school and some students like the school becuase they want to do someone on the future so if the students wants to do something on the fututre they need to have a dreams because the person doest have a dreams they don due anything because we can take the opportunities to the parents give to their childrens becuase some childrens on the world they wants to have any opportunity.

But in my opinion some people is possible to take a class for online maybe is not possible to their going to schools but they can pay classes for online but is not the same like the schools but they can due if they have dreams they can due because everybody have dreams."
1945,92EA64272FB4,"High school is like a preschool for young adults, where they get a chance to explore the world much earlier.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they won't have to stress of what their going to be. It's agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age.

Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they don't like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become.

As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teen's can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying.

As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams.

From there the students path will flow to what college they'll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time.

The students won't stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do.

Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

Its never bad for a kid to have dreams of being a cop and going for that career. Its always good to plan ahead, to always think and do. It's great that a young adult wants to think of it's future. Agreeing something that everybody has done, is something that people can agree on.     "
3460,ECEE1FB05BDE,"Let's be honest if you're yourself and not faking who you are in this world you'll become a better person in this world. One thing you don't ever forget is to be honest,and to be real with yourself and everyone around you.

Girls,if you reading this please don't make the same mistakes that i did in my past be always honest with your partnership or whoever, because the consequences are not how you might think. When i was in 8th grade i met this person i was so in love with him,he add me on snapchat so that same day that he add me i post a pictures that i was in the field,35 minutes after he text me i was so happy,and nervous because i liked him so we start texting but we never talked in person,a week pass by and he start to being disrespectful with me,playing with my feelings i knew that we were just friends in those time. One day i told him that i want him to be honest with me,he always said that he was honest with me,2 week pass by he were keeping playing his little games and i did not say anything i just leave his message in delivered,1 years pass by he texted me saying that he felt so bad for everything he did to me in the past,i just told him everything that i felt for him in the past but he was not honest with me. Girls,let me tell you my big mistake that i did,we talk about 5 months as a friend after we talk for 5 months he make me his girlfriend,at the time i was still feeling butterfly for him that first years is was perfect like any relationship,those 12 months i was so happy,i always told him that he was ''the love of my life'' and i just say it for everything we went trough since middle school also,because he was my first boyfriend and my parents were fine that i was dating him because they though he was a good person.

Girls,find a guy who is real with you all the time they might be a lot of guys out there that can pretend that he is in love with you. Yes, they might be real and make you feel butterfly 5 months or 6,but things changes in this life person change not everything is always the same,anyways he started to lie to me when i knew that truth of that problems is when he start to hurt me all the time but when you love someone you let them hurt you,so i keep letting him hurt me,i started crying and to supplicated to stop hurting me he stop like any relationship we were okay for a week and then he started doing things that hurt,he started talking to girls,and cheated on me but us girls we so dumb that we keep them.2 Years after i was in depression i did not tell my parents they found out when they take me to the hospital because i passed out in my room crying, without eating for days i was in the hospital for a week after that i was able to go they take me to therapy. after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was ""i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i'ts me"" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i'm not going to lie like i'm afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me. i'm not thinking to go out with a guy because girls you have to love yourself to be able to love other person.

In conclusion,if you are honest with yourself your life will be okay without any problem.     "
927,471BD41D6BA9,"Some people say that to converse resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. our school is deciding if they should do a four day school week, with nine hours consisting each day. Others rather to have a normal school week.

I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With an nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade.

Other people say schools should follow this model because, A nine hour school day means more time for each class and having more time in all classes its helpful for homework or late work, They can take advantage of having Friday off students can have a job only on Fridays. "
3003,D760EF65B80C,"Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break.

Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others.

Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyone's high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year.

Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time.

Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress. I suggest the traditonal four years of high school education."
2494,B9A542B2C36C,"I think students should not be able to take classes at home. Because is not going to benefit them with their work. Sometimes students dont know how to do their assignment assigned. Students need to communicate with others to gain more experience.

a lot of students needs help with one person to support them with their work. Some students are not smart enough to work by their-self. If students take classes at home they might have some issues.

For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. They communicate with others share their thoughts. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help.

however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others. Some students have bad attitudes and they dont like been with others or forced to talk. But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience."

Student's can also gain confidence by making and learning from mistakes. student's learn at their own pace and shouldn't be afraid to get some questions wrong, all student's should be self-confident in themselves in order to achieve goals and different opportunities for a good career or a good paying job.

Student's who are confident in themselves tend to do well in activities like sports: soccer, football, basketball..etc. Student's should be confident in order to do well in sports games even if the team is losing, being confidant will give the student the urge and strive to keep pushing and even comeback and win the game.

Student's should be confident at all times even under pressure weather thats in school or out of school activities. Being confident will build up the student's self-esteem, to achieve the goals or career, the student want to achieve.                                      "

3883,FEDCB06D743F,"Dear Generic_Name,

It has come to my attention that schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations trough interships and shadowing opportunities, to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of job. However I'm in favor of the new opportunities that the schools are offering to young teenagers.

Allowing students to explore certain ocupations would motivate students to decide what type of job they want to dedicate their life on.

Every student dreams to have a perfect job, were they can have a good enviorenment and do what they love to do, But for many other reasons; students do not have the same opportunities as other's. with the new chances that companies are offering to students, everyone has the choice to be what they want and be succesful in life.

Every student goes trough a hard process were they have to decide, what they want to become in life. as a result not everyone gets the job they wanted to, causing that this person feels miserable working in a place were they don't feel comfortable. many juniors and seniors are feeling the pressure deciding what type of job they want; However companies allowing students to discover what their passion is and what type of job they want to get,would increase the percentage of students achieving their goals and get the job they wanted to.

Not every student has the chance to get the job they want to. either way because they don't have the sources to reach their goals or they can't because they are not well stablish financially. for example, my dream is to become a doctor but no one of my family have gone to collage, they don't have any expierence nor the sources to help achive my dream. I believe i'm not the only one that is going trough this, schools partenerships with companies benefits everyone in many differente ways, causing that every student has the chance to succed in life.

Lastly, allowing students to have the will to explore new opportunities benefit those who are still deciding what they want to become in life, and those who don't have any chance on achieving their goals. it's very important that every teenager prepares to the real world, without having any doubts or risking themselves to be unsuccesful. companies allowing students to choose what they want to be in life can be one of the many reasons that our future can be secure.

Thank you for taking your time on this matter and allowing me to express my opinion and my greatfullness.

Sincerely,

3807,FB70FE5B31A8,"Generic_Name moved from military academy to a public school whehn he was 14, he was a serious person, and he was really respectful. Four years later, I met him at a restaurant and he was a whole new person, he dressed different and his personality was different, Generic_Name's influences in public schools changed him.

People's character traits are formed by influnces beyond our control because the enviroment that we live in takes a huge part on how we are, who we are, and how we act, and because of people like our parents that have guided us and influenced us throughout our whole lives, and while some people say that a person is able to choos who they are or control their character traits, the majority of the people in society live by other people's influences.

The enviroment that a person lives in takes a huge part on someone's character because; their culture, their religion, and the people they surroud themelves with, always have an impact on someone's traits; for example, a private christian school student might not have the the character traits as a public school student because the enviroments are way different. In conclusion people's traits are controled by influces beyond our control because people is always getting influenced on the daily regardless of what envioment they're in.

People like our parents are responsable for most of the character traits we have since they have been with us our whole life. They guide us everyday, and they teach us what is right and what is wrong. Most of the kids in this world look up to their parents or use them as a role model, and that controls a huge part of our character traits. In conclusion our traits are formed by incluences out of our control because our parents, who have been with us our whole life impact us every day with thei lessons.

Some people say that a person is able to control their character traits or choose who they are, because they are alone and they probably don't like talking to people or learning from people so; therefore they don't get influenced by anyone , so they start forming their character and they start being who they are base on only what they do.

Most of the people in this world are influenced by the outside since most poeple go to work everyday, go to school everyday, and talk to people everyday, thay are always getting something out of someone, it could be an advice or a lesson. I don't think many people are able to control their character traits on these days with social media, and things like that going on.

In concluison our character traits are controled by influences we can't control because the enviroment with live in always has an impact on us, the people we surround ourselves with have an impact on us and society in general has an impact on us. Moving forward i think it would be good for people to keep being influnced by the outside because we will get to know how everything works, and no matter who we are influenced by there will always be someone that will tell is if it's right or wrong."
2293,AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.    "
296,15D10C4DBA29,"Have you ever assist a older student and a younger student from involving a program? It is better from involving a program so they can talk to each other and communicate others, if they are struggling with some work or if they need to stay after school which is important for them to get good grades.

I agree that older students should assist younger students from involving a program because they can help together and cooperate together, if older students want to enjoy a after school activity if they like being it, they can learn about social skills.

I think that cooperating together for students is good because they can hang out and talk with their phones while their at school and they can work as a group of doing a project which is good for them to do if their kind of bored and they can work together of doing a skit or a play or act they like to do and last they should book buddy which that means reading as a group or playing card games each other.

I think that older students like to enjoy a after school activity because they like to do video games because i know that some students always stay after school for video games because they like it a lot they like to play games each other which i play video games with my friend, and students might say 'Yay' i like to stay after school to play video games again.

I think that students should learn social skills, because they can educate themselves of liking it, and there is a another club that is called Personal development which is a good club of social skills so that students like it a lot and their is some fun things that students like one of the activities are really fun for them.

In conclusion, students should help together from cooperating together because they can get to know themselves and they can be happy and they award themselves from accomplishing goals that they do is important for them, and if they get all A's they can improving themselves from their teachers saying "" Students have accomplished their goals because they are on time to class they respect teachers, and students working and cooperating together of doing kinds of work they like to do is best for them.

3278,E3D9EE7C68F1,"Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have. "

Occupations Through Internship and shadowing to discover

Many schools have partnership with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations through internship and shadowing opportunities to discover. Many schools look for the best for you to graduate and to have the best paying job, like I think it's a great idea that the school let's them go out to discover many things that we don't even know and things we never even knew that it excited at all. Students this days don't even know what they want.

I would and will do it of convincing my principle of school to let kids to explore bunch of things like I said before like trying to take them to field trips for them to learn how to use credit cards and take them out to explore nature and study countries.

The oppurtunities to discover will take him to the highest of knowing what he will really want in his future and college for a fact that many kids don't take lead for being scared. Taking the biggest step ever to learn the new life becoming adults. You should never listen to people taking because they will want one thing and another you should think of what you really are passion of working without any complain.

I would convince my manager to take me many places so I will be clear and happy about it. Lets say principle or manager to lets explore new things like better paying wage job like that you won't be killing yourself.

That would help of us thinking if we learn something we love it we can even make our own business and will make lots of money. that will be a fact why asking your principle for many things of going out to explore bunch of things, like that you won't be worrying about money, paying stuff, and won't be dealing with bosses because I hate that they pressure you so much. If I ask to explore I would love to learn to read panels of when they build houses and buildings because they make a lot much money since their isn't much people to do that.

If your parents don't afford shouldn't be a problem if you have good grades you can earn scalerships to pay for them, You just worry about going out and finish high college of 4 years and enjoy it because you will definitely miss it after wards.  "

Why it is important to work by your self? What are the beneficial? Think about it; Work by your self is better than work with a group for many reasons. Work on your own is more beneficial than work with a group learn more, more attention and good grades.

Generic_Name was a student that likes to go to school, he woke up every morning like a normal student does, but the thing is that Generic_Name do not likes is work on his own he prefer work in a group and not by its self because he likes to distract others by talking, playing,be in his phone instead on what he needs to focus on. The time keeps going and going. One day a wise person said

"" The time keeps going and going and wait for no body.''

There was another guy called Generic_Name. Generic_Name against work as a group because he knows that is a distraction and he don not likes to have bad grades. Generic_Name made a scientific experiment his experiment is based on the idea of work in a group or work alone. He talk with his teacher and explain his idea, the teacher agree with Generic_Name's idea. The teacher gives a worksheet to the student that were in the class and the teacher said you may work on your own or in a group.

The result was like Generic_Name thoughts were like, the students who work by them selves demonstrate good work, perfect scores and they did not took long time to finish the work and they were able to help others students. But the other group of students who choose work as group they show something different than the other students that work by them selves, they did not finish the work, others not even start the work between those groups was Generic_Name.

One day Generic_Name met Generic_Name at his house to play a video game. Generic_Name went to Generic_Name house and they start playing the game, while they are playing Generic_Name start ask a lot of question between those question he ask. Why you always work by your self? and not work in a group?

he laugh and answer the questions. I prefer work by my self because I easily distract with my friends, or I start talking with them and I do not finish any of my work. Generic_Name said something especial to Generic_Name. Understand this Generic_Name, work by your self is not the bad you learn, you prepare more your self, more instead of coping someones work. Think abut when a test, quiz, or an Sol comes up. Nobody will there to help you out and you do not know what to do. Please do not take mad at me I just want to help you, Generic_Name said don not worry, I appreciate the word that you said to me.

Generic_Name think over night the words that Generic_Name told him while they were playing, at the next day Generic_Name try to do what Generic_Name does and he found a big surprise that he can do a better job by its self, and time was passing and Generic_Name notice that his grades went up, have more time in home his teacher was surprise on the huge change that

Generic_Name had.

In conclusion work on your own is not a bad decision. Work on your own help to grow in knowledge, successful in life and not depen on others, try the vest to help other and must important to help you.  "

I want to go to a university, but to achieve this goal, I have to put forth effort my going to school and studying all the time. I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. This will be true in school, sports, and in life like my mother tells me all the time. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life.

In my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. We have to practice everyday to have a chance to win. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. Always doing something in sports allows you to be better.

My mom told me when she was growing up that she was poor, and she did not always have food to eat so she picked mangoes off of the tree. She did go to school, but when she was not in school she had to always stay busy. She would go to her grandmother's house to wash clothes or sell some of the mangoes that she picked in the street. She was fifteen years old, and she had no shoes so she worked for rich people in their house cleaning. She tells me this so that I will understand that I have to stay active and she has worked hard to give me a better life. She gets angry when I try to stay in bed and not do anything, because I always need to be active to get somewhere in life.

We achieve more when we stay active, and we always are doing something good. My goals in life are to go to school, and graduate from a college, play sports to stay in condition, and make a better life for my kids like my mother. I can only do these things if I stay active and work hard. It is wonderful how much you can achieve if you always stay active and focused."
1798,87AF2FEABA83,"Some schools thinks that students should attend classes at home. Others might think that attending classes at school will give benefits to the students. Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better.

Therefore, students should take classes in school. Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students. If the students take classes in school, there will be more teachers and staff at the school. Truly, learning from a teacher helps you a lot, because they are teaching you face to face."
10,00B21F9B726F,"Do you think its a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? In some societies, students are expected to identity a career by the time they enter high school. Yes it is a good idea to start young because your already step ahead, you will have background knowledge about the career classes you choose and once you get older you won't have time to choose an career. Also taking courses in high school will help you choose your career like for an example academy classes.

As a students taking a career course, will help them learn more about that career and you will have background knowledge about that career. for an example I'm taking auto technology in highschol becuase I want to learn more about cars and how to fix them. after high school I will be going to a community college so I can learn an advance auto technology class and move on and thats I'm going to succeed in life.

Another reason why its a good idea for students to commit to a career at young age is becuase it will help students choose a good career that pays good money and the students will be a one step ahead. by doing this they will accomplish their goals.

others may say that its not a good idea for students to commit a career at a young age becuase they think its waste of time however, its not waste of their time, becuase once your getting older you wont have time to choose an career that will last.

In conclusion, I think its a good a idea for students to commit to a career at a young age becuase you will have some background knowledge to that specific career, you will be one step ahead, and once you get older you won't have time to choose a career.

All those question's are important to me because on my opinion those are ways to succeed in life. Those question's can help you in the future if you use them. Knowing what you would like to do in the future can help you out because your school might have classes or after school club's for it.

Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. Why is it important? Its is important because if student's know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career. For example if I wanted to be a mechanic, I could take auto collision in edison, and that would start to help me out and give me experience. Knowing what you want to be in the future can help you out a lot, and you do what you like to do, and on my opinion knowing what you want your career to be gives you a advantage in the future.

For some people it isn't a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. They try to find out what what they like, and what they dont like as a career for the future. Some people go to college not knowing what they want to do and find out till there in college. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Now that she knows what she wants to do she studying and trying to reach her goal as being a ultra sound doctor.

If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goal's for yourself, and once you reach those goal's set harder ones to reach. You can set many type's of goal's like one day owning a 5 bedroom house or owning your dream car. You can set goal's with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere.

If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday. One of my goal's is to own my first car before I graduate which is a Lexus Is300 2001. Setting goal's is important in life, and Ithink everyone should set some goal's for themselve's."
1428,6D6E937C3A67,"We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. These are the three main reasons that differentiate people's characters, and makes them good in their own way.

Each person has had a different childhood which is an important part of people's characters. Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older.

People's environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. If a person has a lot of bad friends that person's character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him let's go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character.

Culture has a big impact on a person's character in a lot of different ways. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Sometimes cultures effect the person's character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture.

In conclusion people do not get to choose their character. People's character is formed by a lot of different things such as environment, culture and childhood these are the most important to form a person's character. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other. This is a very important topic and it means a lot to me and other people Thank You for giving me the change to talk about it.       "
3334,E71DABB44645,"This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources.

As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I don't agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn't.

Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let's use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren't really saving energy

Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him.

Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won't get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won't have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments.

However, teacher's opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren't robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers.

My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody's benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school's main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We don't know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we don't have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesn't have, which make us a different environment than the business.

I feel comfortable or confident about this quote because once you already mastered something you keep feelling as if you are still missing something or maybe you think what you already have is not enougth so, you decide to start working on a different thing or proyect just to keep making grow what you have.

In this life nothing comes easy, you have to work harder to build something or what you have in mind, once you build what you got in your mind you still probbably not going to stop trying to build more than what you already have, because you already tasted hows it feel having much, so you keep going and build more and more only because you don't feel that what you got is enougth or you liked how is feel having much.

""Dreams never come throught, untill you make them happen."" That can also describe or talk a little bit, about the quote of Ralph, because when you have a dream and that dream get into the reallity you are going to think like Ralph, you going to feel that is not enought for you and you are going to start trying to do something else to make grow what you got, sometimes this can be taken as a selfishness because you want more than you have but, if someone doesn't feel goog with what they have they can keep working to make it grow.

To begin, my first reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I tell the truth all the time. Because of that, everyone trusts me, and tell me their secrets. Telling the truth all the time also help people recognize me as a good person, and help me make lots of friends. Telling the truth all the time would not only help people recognize me as a good person, but it will also make everyone trust me.

To continue, my second reason is that I never betray someone. Never betraying someone will make people think that I am a good person, and people that didn't like me will start liking me. Never betraying someone is also a good thing because it will make you loyal, and faithfull. People that you never betrayed will like you and become your friend.

Further more, my last reason about how I use this talent for good things is that I am always fair. I treat everyone the same way I want to be treated, and that will make people treat me the same way they want to be treated. I also divide things evenly, so everyone have the same amount. If you want people to treat you fair than, you have to treat them fair.

In conclusion, my talent is honesty and I use it for good things like, telling the truth, never betraying, and being fair. I treat people the way I want to be treated and believe it or not they treat me the same way, so whatever talent you have use it for good things instead of bad things."

For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young you're body don't feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement.

In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are gonna help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep a educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lear a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world."
3594,F2AE464DA15E,"Do you think a good way to success in life you had to fail first?.

In this paper i will argue about, why people should believe fain in life it is so important because if you fail a least in one thing in life it's help you be more confident and be prepared for the real world and also help you that if you want something you had to fight for the.

My mom always tell me "" Be confident i believe in you"". When i was in 1 grade in my country Honduras one teacher tell my mom that i'm not in math the i'm going to fail the grade and i did it. But my mom tell me that and she also tell me if you fail the grade it's no becasue you are not intelligent. It's because it is difficult for you but i know you can do it and i did it the next year i have to take again 1 grade but that year was diffrent and the teacher tell's my mom that it was amazing how good i was in math and the other class too. I'm happy that i fail 1 grade because shows me if you fail one time doesn't mean you had to give up , you had to figth back like i did.

I always said to me you had to fight back never give up in my dreams no matter how difficult is. When i was a kid my dream was the i want to be a lawyer. One time in my school we have to said what we want to be when we grow up and i said i want to be a lawyer. One student tell me how could you be a lawyer you never going to complete that career and said to him you never know no matter how many times i fail. I know i'm going to be a lawyer because if you not fight back for your dreams. That's mean your i said you are failure person and i'm not a failure person. Not allowed other people said you never going to make never.

If you fail one time or more doesn't mean you never going to make is the contrary. In my whole life that it is 18 years old i fail many time but i always i had in mind. I fail i learn a new lesson today beacuse all the fail times i had in my life i take as a lesson to help to prepare for the real world and how it is.

Someone may think i wrong to think like that but they are the wrong ones beacuse no ones is perfect in life everyone make a mistake or fail in something in life

To be a successful person in life you have to take step by step and also no matter how many time you fail keep going. You are gonna make don't allowed other person said what exactly you had to do.

In the future i hope people never give up in their dreams just because they fail one time or more and also show the person's who tell you ""You never gonna make it"". Shows them that you did it all by yourself."

380,1CFAD2A1BC00,"I think that it would be good if we have a after school club because, some students might need to finish up some work there missing. Now let me tell you why it would be more good, first you get to do it in groups and make new friends in the homework club, it makes you more focus in the work that you need to and you can even do it with a group, solo, pairs. and after school homework club is perfect for all those things and it raises your grade up.

all you have to do is...

(1)Ask for your parents permission to join the homework club. (2) try and finish up the work you haven't done yet. And now your done. It even helps the school by you making the school a school where student can grow and learn. if you ask any teachers from our school they would all say that homework clubs are good to help your brain learn more and release that stress that you might have from not doing your work in time and homework club helps you in that.

as a student my self i to have homework and test, and other stuff and sometimes i don't have time to do my homework at home so sometimes i choose my days that i want to stay in homework club for example lets say you want to join a club but you know you have a lot of important work missing then dont choose other electives just choose homework club and then you can choose the elective you want, and with that we should all have home work clubs in each school."
252,1271A68BDC00,"Would you want to spend your day Indoors? I don't think so! There are many ways to spend your day outdoors, for example, excercise with your friends. Many people likes to workout outdoors because It's calming and It makes you less stressful. Just imagine hearing the birds chirping and seeing the butterflies, Isn't that something you'd enjoy?

You can also make a lemonade stand! Everyone loves lemonade, especially In the hot! Putting up a lemonade stand isn't hard. It literally takes 10 minutes or so to put one up. Kids enjoy doing this because they have something fun to do and not lay down on the couch having nothing to do ;However, you're just not giving people lemonade but you're also getting money!

Do you like going to the pool? I think everyone does! Another way you can spend your day outdoors Is going to the pool. Going to the pool is somewhere everyone goes everyday because you can relax on a floaty, play tag In the pool and you can also try new things In the pool that you thought you could never do!

Walking around the neighborhood and listening to music Is also teenagers enjoy doing because they can get to know the area better and It can set their minds off of the things.

Going to the park Is where children enjoy because they can play hide and seek, tag or play around. Teenagers also enjoy going because they can go to read a book or have a picnic! Picnics are fun because you get to talk about stuff with your friends and eat at the same time!

These are some fun ways you can enjoy your time outdoors and not watch Television everyday! "
1854,8BC2D4B87F27,"People believe that students should take music or drama class and i am agree with them because some students like to play instruments and some of them like to enjoy drama events and a lot of students like to draw even if they're not good drawing but they try and that's why they should take art class and the same thing with students who likes to play instruments. But the problem is if a student want to take those classes they have to ask for a permission from their parents first, because a lot of students want to take the class but their parents they're don't agree with their children and also sometimes to take those classes its need time and some kids don't have compassion to take it easy and they ruined it. But many students love to play instruments and they usually give their time on it and they learn with time practicing.

For example, A lots of students like to play sports for school and they talk with their parents first if they can play and also, if the parents agree with their children decision and the same thing with music class,drama,art etc. Because for those kind of stuff always need time. But i am agree with people who believe that students should required to take music,drama and art class because they can learn something new in their life and someday they can find a job to be an artistic or musician to play song in any events and drama they can get to record for the TV shows and that will be a good job for them in the future.

Those people who think that students should take classes for music,art,drama they support their children that's why they want their kids to take it and that's the good thing because they give the permission and a opportunity to their children to learn."
1095,53E542321463,"Dear Principal,

I agree with what you think but sometimes students need sport so that they can think better. I am in a sport and I wouldn't like to miss my sport. I believe students should keep playing sports but their grade average should go up at least to a B. I am worthy that students grades will go up.

Think about it's if the students are in sports because you nor their parents would want them out of the house to go with a group of bad people. so think about what I am telling you then write back. I hope you agree with what i am writing. Just think that you were a kid without sport and out in the street with those bad people.

3834,FCE7BA86AFDF,"Why should we share anything to others? Because it makes feel relive if it is the thing that hurts and also it may make new friends. People can learn many new things which they might even not know in their life. It is important to learn from the experience of others because it helps to face the problem if same problems occurs and to make new friends by sharing experience to them.

It helps to face the problems if the same problems occurs. With the help of the experienced of a friend people will be able to work on problem. Help of a friend will be a lot easier because he/she may already know about it. It makes people resilient. Trying the difficult type of problems will make people resilient. Many people may get to know about that problem deeply. They will do their work better if they know how to deal with the problems easily if they know more information about that difficult problems. They will get to know whole thing about doing a better job with best ability of them.

1129,57B782277D2F,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone and what do you feel is more beneficial? I think that working with a group is more beneficial because you can get things done quicker, share creative ideas, and it shows teamwork. It also saves up time when working in a group and when having deadlines.

First, working with a group gets things done quicker and you don't have to worry about much things when working with a group. When you have a group, they could be doing something else while you do another thing at the same time. However, having to do all that stuff by yourself slows you down and might not have time to finish. Your group and you are all doing something and that makes everything go quicker because your not doing it all by yourself. If you work alone you could be stressed and have to think of all the ideas. Working in a group can really bring more ideas to the stuff you and your group are working on. Also, you can divide the work with your group members and make things faster.

Second, sharing the ideas with your group can be helpful. It can also be very fun working with other people and having different opinions around. Someone in your group can be the most creative person and really help out on what you are working on. If you don't share your ideas then whats the point of being in the group. Everyone needs to have something to say and something to work on. If you work alone you will miss the opportunity to have someone helping you and have an opinion on it because when you present it, other people might something to say about it. Working alone can be frustrating and exhausting for some people because when they don't know something on one will be there to help them. Also, having to work alone might make you to multitask a lot and difficult for you to finish on what you are doing.

Last, shows teamwork and that teamwork makes everything better than having to work alone. When you show teamwork with your group it shows that all of you can be leaders in that group. Working in a group can be really fun because you be partnered up and meet new people or be with the same people you know and make the work effort exciting. When being in a group, you can your part while everyone else does theirs and it makes everything go quicker.

In conclusion, I would prefer working with a group than working alone because working with a group make things much easier and less work too. I wouldn't want to work alone because I wouldnt have anyone to discuss and share my opinions with. Having to do all that work by yourself can be very difficult in the process; things may not come out the way it should. Also, when you work alone you might not have many ideas to think of and with a group you can. Working by yourself may not be as much fun as in a group. If you had a group you would be able to divide the work, but working on something by yourself probably make it two times harder. That's why I think that working in a group is more beneficial than working all alone."

317,171E655CC8F1,"Attend classes from home by way of online can be a good idea but , in my position is not a good way for the student and can be innecesary or bad idea in many reasons.

When the student is in home he going to do what he want he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason.

My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that.

Some people says when the student take the online class from home he are more concentrade however whent the student take this classes from home he are more distractic because he have the cellphone in his hand or he have the TV in the room, the dog, the play station and he going to prefer play or see movies than work on the classes.

In conclusion thye student can no work , no have the teacher for question or warn he can lostr the class or are more distractict or prefer play than work on the class are my reasons for no take online classes but with the good students can be a good idea."

64,05021F4CA528,"I belived that what you yourself choose to make it because alot people have different choices in the life some people have different influence of what they belived on there own choices and ability for example like life style and what they enjoye doing to do also what they belived and whats right or wrong, who they hangout with.

I learned it in different sitution from expericing with my friends like some they change there belives and some have different life style of living some parents disaprove of them the way of living and some are disapointing what they choose to do in life. I have a friend that there parents are religious they dont agree with his life style but still respects his chocies in life. I used to haning out with my friend in house where im met his parents they told me there stories about how education was so important to them how they got more jobs from it but the otherside of there family like his uncle didnt graduted from collage but still came sucessful. I have other example told my parents my sister like going to school and told them i didnt have a interest in going to school i sometimes thought about not going to collage.

Also I belived what you youself to choose to make it because alot people have different choices in life and history some depening places where you live of come from for example like in eastern Europea Bosina and Hergionvian some people are Catholic,Orthdox and some are Muslim they grew up having life style of living and also in the U.S some people dont use modern stuff and us old fasion for example the Amish and also speak Germen differnt dialect and english.

I belived people have the right to choose they way want to live or do with there choices they make and become sucessful. I think people have different mind set of life finding out who they are whats there goal in life.

I belived there different goal and ability of doing it and the passion.

I belived alot people can anyting in life that is someting postive bring joy and get alot of sucess and get noticed.

also for the people that do negitive things i belived they should get a second chance to do it no one is perfect i think failure is the mother of succes people should have a postive mind what there going to do."
1957,93C575DB7931,"Would you rather ask one person or multiple for advice

I think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. it will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice.

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices.

Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.

Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good."

3378,E8C554B25F19,"Do our character have to be formed by that way the we performed or by influences. Your character will be what yourself choose to make it. We should formed our character by influences beyond our control.

In addition, by the influences that we receive day by day we chooses how to be creating our character. For example, I introduced my character in the situations the I pass, that help me how to be a better person. Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she can't believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we don't want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we don't want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i don't try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future. Also, Things are necessary somethings is hart to change our character because we think the we are okay but other think all the appositive, so we never have to think the we are fine because the never is going to happened always we have to be better in some thing we need to be honest with our lives and accept what we are doing wrong is more better to accept our errors and there is went we are going to see how our character change in a better way and then we are going to feel happy about our character and our lives.

Moreover, The influences control our character by the way the we act and think. For example, I was a person the if something I don't like I really have to talk to you the was horrible. Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really don't like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we don't think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we don't think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you don't like the people act with a bad attitude you don't have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the. In addition, all thinks the people said about you help you with your character, don't feel sad because you change your way to think. Obviously the take your time because you are not going to change in one morning but with a professional character more doors are going to open and more opportunities came so take other people influences.

Some people argument the we should choose our own character traits, because some people just are going to tell you bad opinions in the way the you have to act. Moreover, some people believe the is no necessary to get a great character. In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we don't have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that. In addition, some people don't care if you are okay, or how you feel. In addition others argument the is necessary listen to others influences because sometimes we don't find a way to resolve our character problems bur other know what to do and they try to find a way to make you live easy. For example, I know some people the dont know how to control they character when they are mad soy they contact person the know how to act in the situations. Also, some people take careers for find solution to person the have serious problems with they character I really dont know if is normal the people get mad went they want to eat, I have a friend with the problem in my point of view the is not normal because i never pass from the situation so I can't help her but people the have long time studying on the yes they can tell her what way to eat or i don't know but they have a solution for the problem in her character. In Addition all this problems can help you to have a good character a better attitude because is necessary for talk with other because we need to have a way a formed how to talk without breaking they feelings because as humans the we are we feel sad went other trade us with a mad face and sometimes we performed don't talk to then. So always remember the a good attitude change to many things.

In Conclusion, sometimes is necessary be influencing by other because they give you different ways how to be working in your character. In addition they received influences by other help you with the control in your character by changing a your way to act and covert you in a better person. Also help your character in a better way to think, in be focus on your ideas. In conclusion all this things are necessary in whatever way the you want to used then because in the proved of the live all things are necessary event if are smalls things they are necessary don't thing the people just influences your self in change your character because they just want to fight with not the is not like that is people is trying to give you a better influences about how you have to act because they always want better things to you. Always if you do bad on your character they are going to tell you and I thing the is more better if they tell you what you are doing wrong the others persons the you don't know came just for the just because you don't want to obey always think in you future. The is necessary a excellent character for a better work or food different's things the you want to realized."
1059,510CA49B78BB,"Is setting an example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people? Sometimes it is not the best idea to mirror other people's behavior because some people do not always have a positive behavior. There could be time's that someone could be in a negative place of mind, reckless, and does a lot of horse play; other time's people can be charming, properly mannered, and influential.

Growing up in the Generic_City area, I have been able to witness a lot of drugs, gangs, and violence. The example these group of people decide to display is not a very positive act on their behalf; this is not a pathway you would want to be taking because of the bad outcomes from it. I remember I had a friend who's father shot himself due to the poor choice he made which made him reflect and he figured that was the only solution.

On the other hand, some people decide to be very influential to society in a positive manner. Out of my three years of high school I was able to see some students making their way for others by not being selfish; a lot of them did volunteer work as well to help the community and to hopefully inspire others to do so as well. I actually got the opportunity to throw a kids halloween party at a church: I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun.

Honestly, I do not feel like I am a good example nor do I feel like I am a bad one either. I make mistakes: it is how I was taught. Growing up I believed that the only way you are ever going to learn is by making mistakes and being able to evaluate the error of your mistake; only then you can truly improve yourself and help insipre other people as well.

In conclusion, I am mutual about examples being the best way to influence other people because of it not always being a positive thing due to the poor decisions some people choose to make. Truthfully I think it is a better idea to be the best you that you can be because at the end of the day there is only one of you and so many of us; it is best to stay unique."
3712,F7DD6134C693,"Generation by generation there is a new technology, out time we have cell phones, computer, tablet. People use cell phone in positive way and some times in negative way as comunication, news or to study, some school allow students use it in classroom for education purposes and some school they not allowing it for so many reason.

Schools should allow students to use there smart phone in classroom for many education purposes as recourding a labs or math or for communication betwwen students in group project.

Having a cell phone in classroom make teacher now who is apsent and who's not with some new technology application and we cell phone they can done there work easyer.

By not allowing students use there cell phone they will lose time that they not having it, and make things difficult and students they will make a lot of nuse bye talking to each other in some group project.

Students want his class to be easyer and he want to enjoy it and learn every day from it and by make easyer by using cell phone every one going to be happy."
1886,8E53C7642922,"Have you ever group up with older or younger students before? And you think of eachother's differently and won't work it out, well there a program that helps older and younger to solve that problem.

Older students can teaches the younger students to learn the next year problems or tests that is coming up. The younger students would confuses how do the problems infront of them and would need helps. The older students help the younger students with their studies. Older students can help them read the sentences on the problems they have or help with the steps of the problem. The younger students can help the older students what they learned and teach them how the problems works again. A lot of older students forgot what they learned in the past and it's stressful. In sixth grade, my teacher let's all sixth grades read with 2nd graders and it's how younger and older bonds little bit.

The younger and older students can bond eachother in the program. They can learn from eachother what they do in their own grades to lighten up the day without awkwardness. It's a teamwork program that helps younger and older students to assist for eachother. It's like a group project and they have to work with eachother to finish the project and helps eachother step by step. One time i was little a older student alway read to me and slowly we bonded, It's was nice at the end of the day. Bonding is a key to success of learning from eachother and we are the same person with different thoughts and mind."
2928,D2EBEB5FDA90,"I believe technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. The reasons are,they buy thing online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for them.

Purchasing online things are not always great. When you do purchase it online sometimes they don't always tell the truth and when your getting phones or other things like clothes or makeup. These thing you never know if its used or brokering and if someone could of warn it too. Also food that are buy online are not fresh and they could Carey germs. Take for example when you go out you look at the food to see, which one is good and which one is bad but when your online you can't tell what your getting. This cause people to become lazy.

People become lazy because of how much stuff there is on online and games,

TV shows. Therefore people rather watch a TV show then go out with there family. This is bad for people because this can cause people to become depressed,more stress about online chats and what there saying online or watching a TV show;but you wish you could be that person. People will stop going outside. Take for example YouTube, YouTube is the most used media but also there are non-stopped videos they can go on forever and people stared to thing they have to many things to do. This cause peoples communicant with others harder. YouTube cause people to give up.

Communicating is becoming harder for people because they don't face to face talk anymore. Now they use phones more. Phones are used for texts ,calling. So why is communicant important? Communicant is the main thing in your life it brings people together and you need it for jobs. Jobs where you have to work with other people and help people that buy from you. Take for example Generic_Name is the co work and Generic_Name is the costumer,Generic_Name does't talk to people that much because she texts more ,therefore, when Generic_Name came up to her ask for help. She didn't help because she doesnt like talking to people.

Therefore,technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. I believe these are the reason,they buy things online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for people. Peoples need to use less technology and try to open there self to the outside world and hang with there friends and family or read books. Some will still choose to use technology today."
2796,CC68BA9DCB2F,"Asking alot of people for advice is always a great idea. Since you don't know whether the advice is good or not, its better to listen to different opinions from different people, in order to make better decisions.

For example, in four year i'll be going to college.When i'm choosing which college to go to, I will ask several people for advice. I'll ask my mom and dad to see how much money we have. Asking them can help me choose college that are not so expensive. Then i'll ask my siblings what they did after high school. One of them is planning to attend SCHOOL_NAME soon, and he told me that is a really good college for studying law. From hearing that, I might add SCHOOL_NAME to my list. Finally I'll ask my counselor where I should go, since she knows what my strength are and what my weakness are. She can suggest which college suits me the best. Hearing those advice from different people can help me choose the best college to attend.

After I enrolled in college, I will ask my parents for advice. They told me in college, studying is way more important than socializing. They also warned me to be careful and surround myself with people that will bring positive change in my life. After hearing from them, I asked my friends what they would do. They told me they would party all night and drink alcohol. Comparing my parents advice with my friends, obviously, my parent's advice are much better. It's always better to ask more people than one so you don't make a mistake.

College means independent life, before graduating high school, ask more people for advice! Everyone have different opinions, choose which one is best and which one will help you the most!"
565,2B4AB39B1C76,"Yes there should be one way to improve student achievement to start an after school homework club in my school, because there's allot of student that really need help on there homework, teacher should stay with student that need help with that class homework so they can understand more what there learning in there classroom so they don't get confused on that time of a test, they can get a good score because they have study with there homework and they have get allot of help from there teachers. But some student don't like doing homework when that teacher ask them if they should stay with them student don't even stay after school and that teacher gets really mad because some times they takes time that day to stay with a students and they don't even show up.

Teacher take time of there social life to help student for there homework to do good on there report card because some teacher care about homework that student needs to complete it on time or that teacher give them more time and they still don't even do it that's why some teacher don't give no extra time any more, that teacher tell them if they want a A's or F's on there report card because they don't finish there homework, there should be a only homework club after school so other teacher should not stay and do work for that next day, but someone student throw there homework on that trashcan because they don't care about how hard teacher work to give them a good education to stay after school.

Some student understand that homework and finish really early, that student should help other on there homework and do a after school club and help each other on what they do need help on,but went teacher let student help each other they only like playing or talk and not even help with that homework, but if they don't know each other they do finish and help, but some student don't like went someone else is helping them because they don't explains how a teacher will explains to them because some student only give them that answer and that how they don't like other student helping them because some teacher ask how they got that answer and they don't event know how to explain to a teacher that how that teacher know that they copy someone else.

Student achievement will grow allot bigger if they start after school club teacher and student volunteer to help other that are really begin of homework and other works will help them if there was a only homework club because some student don't even do it because they dont understand or they forget to do it but if they do it after school there not going to have to much difficulty on there homework any more, some subjects don't have homework but went they don't do that homework they talk to that teacher that they had allot of homework and they forgot to that homework but they don't even try do work on it. some teacher try to help them to do it but they still don't even try to do it, they rather get a bad grade and not do that homework.

Some student want to finish their homework early went they have time they like to do it during class time because they don't like staying after school in class they ask that teacher for help or other student in that class because they finish there work on time and don't have any thing to do so they start finishing that homework so they don't need stay or finish it at home they can rest and don't worry about homework or they can stay after school and finish with that that student that finish on time and if they don't like working with other student they can stay with a teacher, some teacher like other student helping other because some teacher think that helping each other will understand more and they will ask question to each other to learn what there were doing in class.

Allot of student will improve there grades and there will do there homework early if teacher call there parent to stay after school to do homework allot will finish early and they will not feel that they got do allot of homework at home some student go home and play and they forget that they have homework to do, there mom ask them if they have homework and they answer with a no but went a teacher call them to stay after school that there kids have not do any homework in that class, that they have a F's in that class because they don't finish that homework on time and they don't care about if they need to finish that homework, after school teacher should award student for staying after and finish there work on time so they can feel happy that there grades are going up.

After school club in other school will help allot of student to do got on any test because homework helps allot to study and do good on any class but if you don't try to do your homework your going to have difficulty went it's time to take a test because you haven't even doing not of your homework or not even staying after school club, other school don't like doing homework clubs because they think that everyone understand that homework because know one ask for any help and never brings homework to class teacher thinks that they don't like do it, or they tell that teacher they forgot it home and that teacher believed on them and they get a good grade but don't even do it,some student volunteer to meet with those who either have difficulty and other student don't even stay other student takes time always to help other and other don't even thanks those student.

2065,9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.

Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.

I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.

In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.

According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.      "
1513,747E3560442E,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on your experiences, do you agree or disagree with Emerson's statement? Take position on this issue. I believe what author Ralph Waldo wrote is true.

First reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. I think if you don't work hard for what you want,you will never accomplished it. Also believe in yourself and be confident, if you have skills use them. However, someone people have skills, but are not confident with their self. Practice or training will help you be successful.

Second reason, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my experienced I wasn't confident I would be shy to present my project. Although, I got my first job and helped me a lot with my fear. Now when my teachers asks who wants to present I will raise my hand first, so I can get over it.

Lastly, why I agree on what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. In my second experienced I was good at algebra and my other subjects, but my junior year I gave up when my grades dropped to a zero. In my second semester i started bringing my grades to at least a C, to make my mom proud. Until this day I feel proud of myself too.

In conclusion, you should not give up on something you love to do nor let someone tell you what you can and cannot do. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right , work hard and you will be successful."
71,0546517E6BAA,"When we make our own decision , we are creating our own world. People should make their own decision than be guidance from experst and authorities because they can't grow like a person by it-self. If they are guidance from experts or authorities they can't develop their own knowledge. That not help then because they are depending by other people and they can't never try something different by it-self. I agree with people who make their own decision because they build a self-confidence, learn be independent, and develop own skills.

When people make own decision they build a self confidence. One example of build self confidence is that we can believe in our self in what we can do. another reason is that we can feel confident by making our own plans. last reason to build our self confidence is that we have the ability to create our own future by making good decisions. Taking our own decisions always help us to feel confidence because we feel like a responable person in each decision maked.

Taking our own decisions helps us learning to be independent. One reason is that we learn to work by our self by making the decision to create our own businees without be guidance from a experts. Another example is that we learn to get up by it self, when we fall down by a bad decision. Last reason is that we have the right to do better if we get something wrong in our lives by a bad decision. When we make a good decisions by our self we feel independent because we are learning to live by ourself.

The people who make their own desicion, they are developing own skill. When we take own decision we are improving our knowledge becuase we are understending about what are the good decision and bad decision. Another reason is that we are learning to develop our own personality because making desicion help us to get more experience in our lives. Last reason is that to make decisions also help us growing like a person because when we take decisions they make feel us with confidence that we are people with great capacity to do anything. Make decision in our lives help us to develop our own skill because we are understanding how hard is live if we select a wrong decision.

Make owns decision always help us to grow by ourself. By doing own decision we can build self confidence to be a successful people in our lives. Practicing own decision help us to be independent and make feel us as a responsable peoples. When we make own decision ,we are making our own progress for future coming by developing skill like doing better our personaliity. It is for this an many others reasons that people should believe that is better made their own decision than be guidance from experts and authorities."
169,0CCB18D0CAB7,"My central idea is supported with specific imformacion about this threes reason, one make something great for other people, two specific job, three skill. and give my opinion about all this and be very specific.

In my opinion I agree with Emerson, Because is very important to make semething great for other people that you want to help. This could be a good reason constantly to help a lot people to accomplishment dreams, goals and purpose in the life. For example make something good for people that want growing and that the families feel pround by the achievement. Other example, give to other people a reason for to going forward and cumply their dreams and purpose in the life.

Specific job, a specific job make something greatest for a lot people in this world. In this job we help to peoples that want cumply their purpose in their lifes and enjoy their accomplishment. Specific job that can help a lot peoples to get many oportunities for working in any work. We help to get a good information about a specific job that want greatest a magnific accomplishment. We recollected a good information about your dreams and goals that you want, for get a excellent job that you want in your life. My idea central is help to other people to find greates accomplishment in your lifes. For example we can help to other people to find information about carreer and specific job. Other example reach information about what want the people in specific for get an amaizing accomplishment.

To have a skill to trying to make something else is the greatest accomplishment that you can make for other people. when you decide to help to other peoples that is very interested to going forward with the batalle of wanted fo get a good accomplishment. For example you have a big ability for help to other people to get a greates accomplishment, you can help to othetr people, and this can be some amaizing in your life and in my life too.

My conclusion is help to other people to find a greatest accomplishment and purpose in the life, that can make very happy the rest of the life and enjoy a magnific job that I want, and always going forward and never finally the dreams and porposes, and never stop to dream high.    "
648,32380C91070A,"It has been said that the importance of positive attitude is a key to success in life. i believe that have positive attitude is better then having a negative attitude.

Its better to foward then moving backwords to put postive thought head and keep moving ahead.

I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success, it help in many way when talk to someone or when talk to costumer. Having a positive attitude help when working in a work place For example,

when a costumer is giving a hard time instead reflecting back it better to respond with a positive attitude then a bad one. Then matter will turn out better.

when reflecting back with a negative attitude the outcome isnt great it worst it better to smile then be mad.

Its important to have positive attitude because there better outcomes having a better attitude is a big key to success it help when dealing a bad situation. Having a positive attitude change the way you see thing there much better outcome like seeing a smile on someone face because the attitude you gave them was positive and not negative. The action we do reflect on what is said or done, just like attitude reflect back. when giving the right attitude everything is better and there no bad responds or action done.

The important of attitude is the emotion some gives when thing change for example, when a job gives a raise to someone the person attitude change because there happy. Small things changes a person attitude and a way of thinking. when thinking about the way your attitude can change in just a split second by the action taking place is pretty amazing how not only when someone is happy the attitude they show is better then it was before.

In conclusion having a postive attitude is very important when to talking to someone. It is big part of life and it will help you with succes when facing a problem in the long run. the important of attitde is the way to think or feel and what makes you happy.

There is so much succes when you have the right attitude. Don't let the wrong attitude reflect back do better. Being negative won't help,

i agree with having the right attuide is the key to succes."
3890,FF6224AC70C6,"A city council is having arguments to adopt curfew for teenagers,10 P.M on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Some people thinks this to be a good idea,but others especially like young people does not think so. There are conflicting opinions over this topic. According to me this is a good idea to set a limit for teenagers who stay away from home late night. In my opinion,this adoption can lead to improvement in sleeping habits of teenagers,prevents unhealthy food habits and allow teens to spend more time with their families.

Curfews to stop teenagers going out of home late night make them improve their sleep time. As they are home they sleep on better time than they are out till midnight. For young people sleep time should be 7-8 hours atleast,because of their growing body structure. Young people are more energetic if they sleep well. Staying out late disturbs bed time for teens,which makes them lazy,tired and inactive in activities going on around us. Unadequate sleep can also lead to risk in driving a vehicle. As you could not sleep well you may feel dizziness while driving a vehicle,which is really dangerous. A lot of teens die in road crashes because of unattentiveness while driving,this unattentiveness comes from unadequate sleep. Also the crashes are caused due to drink and drive habits after staying out late night. To protect teens from death in that early age curfews should be adopted. As when me myself could not sleep well,I am unable to concentrate on my work in my class. This alot of times effects my grades. Also when I stay awake till late night separates me from what is going on in real world because when people around me are awake,I am not focused and asleep.

This adoption also somehow effects teens eating habits. Staying out means eating unhealthy and junk food,which is not at all good for young people's health. Along with adequate sleep we also should be healthy to stay fresh and active. It is really necessary for young people to eat healthy food because they have their full life to live and if they will stay unhealthy,they will get diseases in really early age. Not only food when teens go out with friends they drink alcohol or beer, which is not good for them at that early age. Unhealthy food weakens teens immune system which leads to diseases in quite early ages. Not only diseases unhealthy food collects a lot of fat in their body that effects teens socially,mentally and physically. If teens stay in the house they eat food provided to them by their parents, also which is healthy and not too oily. Whenever I eat unhealthy food it makes me sick and if you are in place where no one knows you,people there likes tyo stay away from me which makes me feel uncomfortable. I have seen a guy in my family who have grown fat after eating a lot of junk food,he suffers a lot of problems like he need someones help to get up if he sits down,a lot of people teases him for his fatty body and also he cannot even walk fast because he gets tired fast. So to stay away from these bad comments and unfit body teens should eat healthy food and home made food.

Apart from food and sleep curfew for teenagers make them stay home with their families. This makes them to interact with their families instead of going out with friends. Most of times generation gap is being shown in between families that is just because of less attraction in between people in the families. Having dinner together at night makes you discuss various aspects going on around us. Like when our family get together we talk about of new things we tried,just as me and my sister made new friends as we shifted here this year. Also we talk about how to be aware from diseases going on in recent days. We also discuss about problem we are suffering from. This makes us share our happiness and problems we are going through in our life and also we are able to intract wih the family members.

There are various more ideas that shows that this adoption takes teens lives towards positive aspects. Proper sleep,healthy food and interaction with their families can be obtained if this curfews are adopted. To make future generation healthy and concentrated about development and growth of our country these laws are need to be applied. If teens will be healthy they will come up as fresh and present minded citizens towards the country. If they will sleep well,they will work hard to make their dreams come true. Also if they will interact with their families they will make each and every one satisfied in world. Teens should take this in a positive way instead of taking it as a restriction on their freedom. This is not a reastriction but a key to live healthy,fresh and active way of life. Give teens life by restricting their habits instead of giving them dealth with improper lifestyle."
1651,7D94F809823A,"Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. looking for information, buying a book,

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

1043,4FA6CCB0D1BA,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in there years and enter college or the work force one year early. yes we need to done high school because it's to important to for life,but about your familiys and for your country. Then however If you not finish high school it,s not good because you not ger a good work and anyjob.

Is it a good idea for students to finish high school. The First it,s to important to your life because if done the school we can choes whatever you want,Then we going to college just chose your option to lear a four years to college, After that i,m looking find a job.

The Scond, about your familiy. If you finish the high school your familys to happy because we can leave to a good life with your whole familys, and we can get a strght life. Then your familys is always to makeing to happy.

The fainliy, If you finish high school and college you get a good job,and whatever you want to get the job,but we can suport to your family and your conutry If you get a good job suport to other people If you can,thrn even everones we need you. however If you not finish school we can get a good job because you don,t have high school diploma that,s mean a document confering a privilege or honer so don,t have that why, but you work to like clean,shopers and like the simple you get the job, and you not happey bcause some people distraicting, and It,s to mach tarid. that means we can do finish your high school."
3008,D77A3352CB34,"For some reason I think it is not a good idea because the students are not decided what they want to be in a short time, they need learn more things in school, because they can regret for take some careers because they have another perspective when they was a young, sometimes they lost the time at find another career that they want because they choose one career that probably don't know how was it when they wasa young.

Still better option choose the career when you finish high school for you have more time for looking something that be for you agrade and that you prefer, you need take a decision when you choose one career, some you are good or something that make feeling well,example you are very nice doing somehting that make you happy or some career hard that making a lot money, is your choice.

For another way if the students are decided what they want to do when they are younger, they had more time and get more experience."
316,17085E68BA88,"Personally, I have been able to find myself to be able and do more when I'm up and active, as in doing something good for me, someone else, or in general. It's like you're able to do more once you're up and you are able to tell yourself that you can do better and you can do more than what you're supposed too. As Jefferson said ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Sometimes you can be so into the work and time can fly and you can get so much done with no distractions.

When I am doing something positive for myself and I want to do more, I find me telling myself a lot ""what good will this do to me?"" or ""where will it get me?"" I'm sure that I'm not the only one asking myself questions like these when I want do something good for myself or my life. When we are doing something for us, we can ask ourselves questions like the ones I stated. Once we do more than what we want to do and keep a positive mindset about it, that can be able to stick with us and become a good habit we can carry on in our lives. Which is amazing. We'll be able to strive for the best for ourselves and others when we carry on a good habit like that and show others how much we care about not just ourselves but others as well. We can always be able to carry a positive mindset with us and we can pass that on to others and it'll be able to motivate people to do more than what we can do once we are up and doing something.

I really tend to look at the bright side a lot and look at what is at the end or the outcome, when I'm trying to strive for the best by doing the absolute best that I can. We may have our moments where we can get tired of doing the most, but then we are able to tell ourselves how much the hard work is worth at the end when we do the most of what we're supposed too. Once we do the best that we can, we can reflect on it later on in life and be so proud of ourselves and tell ourselves how tired we were for doing the most but how much worth it all was at the end. I have my moments where I can be so tired of trying my best and just want to give up. But then I take a step back, look at my work, and once I'm done and I tell myself how proud I am because it got me far. We also are able to have no regrets at the end of the day and reflect on it and see how dedicated we were and still are to this day. We can tell others our story and say how proud you are for yourself and see how dedicated you were and still are for doing what you can and doing better. Not in any bragging type of way but to motivate them in a way. You're able to pick up the habit of being so dedicated to bettering yourself or others by doing more once you're doing. It's like self motivation, telling yourself ""you can do more.""

Once we pick up this good habit of accomplishing more than what we are supposed too, we motivate not just ourselves, but others as well to do more and more. Like I said, we can look at the bright side of it always, and feel nothing but good and proud of ourselves at the end. When we build this good habit and do the most, we are able to do the more than what we could before and little by little building that up. At the end of accomplishing what you could, you are able to tell others what the hard work and dedication gives you at the end of it all. As well as how far it get's you in life. It can sometimes motivate others to strive for the best and it can help them, sometimes they need to hear you out for it to motivate them. What I like about it is that, when we are able to pick up this good habit of ours, we can tell others about it and it can motivate them to do the same. It's like we talk them into to striving for the best for themselves and others in life. It's like we are passing this good habit we've built down and then it just keeps going and going. Sometimes hearing others out really helps others a lot.

When you are able to just take a moment and take one step back, it really is possible for you to accomplish more than what you can when you're doing. You motivate not just yourself but others when you really are dedicated to doing your best and it can become a good habit. You're able to pass that down and it can give you a positive mindset to it all. The outcome can turn out to be good and make you feel good about yourself at the end. It can get you so far in life as well and you're able to look back at the most that you have accomplished and have no regrets about any of it. It is truly motivational and can truly help if you are really dedicated to it all."
3488,EE99F74CAE44,"Philosopher, Physical, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others, actually being a example can not be a good thing to influence others becuase first you need to start doing the right thing on your own before you decide to be a example or influence others and that's mean that you need to do everything perfect when that's means that it is hard to do it.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what

I don't have.

In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others."
1643,7CC4A8E1948E,"Winston Churchill is a good person everybody knows that, a person that give good idea or a person that bring idea to life . Thing he say they are true, they can open your mind, and make you think.

Yes : I agree with Winston Churchill. I know some people say that too, to be success at first; you going failure to failure, in once you try not to failure guest what, you fail again. This can be happen , but Winston was right , to success you can fail all the time. When somebody want to be success in he/she fail, that doesn't mean they cannot "" try"" again. But the thing is, they need to get up in keep trying on till then.

If success brought people failure to failure, then what would that be in life, when you fail on try to be success, it not a bad thing cause sometime in life either you: win or you loos, but at least you can try one more time. Failure might be discourages you, but you can Always keeping going to accomplish your gold, or maybe you might "" successful"" after all.

1)Success is a good thing for those who fail in fail in the results, they successful. Winston idea was right, so my position is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loosing enthusiasm are lesson you. With enthusiasm your success going greats and fast. Thats it true enthusiasm try to find your success can make a big differences. An in endurance can bring you to successful too, in time you'd need it.

2)If you pursuit or enthusiasm your can success anything that you thing that hard can be easier's for you, cause you put your ; Enthusiasm, and convicted your issue. Failure without trying "" does not"" gave nothing excepted discourage, in that will be stupid of you if you failure in you give up in the same time.

3) Failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm will give you something in return, in that is ""fact"" no dispute about it. Even those who loves you can make fun of you, it they sees you keeping failure; or stay away from you on till you ""win"" or find what you want's.

Anabel for you to be success you need enthusiasm, it gonna give courage, and not to focusing on you failure, then you'll never success or accomplish your gold. For example : Generic_Name his a psychology teacher in Generic_School,Generic_Name never thought he will be a teacher cause his gold was to teach psychology, unfortunately he cant past his test so that he can graduated, but he thought about it , he put all his enthusiasm on it Generic_Name past the test in now his a successful guy. There are tree reason that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

ONE, if you a failure in you didn't put your enthusiasm on you ""success"" you'll never be successful.

TWO, take example about people who never thought they will success, such ass Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and Generic_Name Generic_Name.

TREE, always get up when fail, always focuses on you success, and take that serious when you a failure. As a Mather of fact , look at all the Hollywood stars' , some of them didn't born with success some of them were poor, having no skills ,and some of them didn't have no education. They work hard in hard to be success cause that was their gold to be "" success"" in they accomplish it even if they fail sometime.

Winston Churchill was right about that, i'm 100% agree with his statement. If you a failure in then you loss your enthusiasm you will never be "" success"" . That's a true statement for success, in

I really Agree with Churchill's statement about the important role failure plays in the pursuit of success.

If you have a gold to be success in you though you a failure , don't like that why cause with : enthusiasm, and consists you can accomplish anything, even thing that you image you'll never accomplish or be success.    "
616,2EB94A444839,"Some schools offer an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools think that it is a benefit that help students who don't want to go school or if they have diseases, they can't go schools. Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits.

Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students can't learn good like in school.

At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents don't let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they can't go to schools because they can't walk. It would be better for they because taking classes by online or they can make a video conferencing with a tutor. They can learn about all classes they want to know and it would be a benefit for their future because they will get a diploma that will be help for them. Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school.

Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who don't want to go schools because if they don't like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there won't be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they can't learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who don't speak English and they don't want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I can't speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I don't want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me. For me, taking class in schools is better than home because now I go to school and it is hard even if I go to school. I am improving the language with help of teacher and friends.

In conclusion, taking classes from home is not a hundred percent a benefit. It just have some benefits for some students. For some students taking classes from home is hard because they don't learn too much. Overall, if I take classes in home or school,

it is something relevant because even if I am in one or anther place, I am learning something. It is not a thing of other world. It is just for students that have the purpose to learn and be someone in life. Going to school help me to improve my life each day. Each day, I can learn something new and now my language is improving because I have people who want to teach me and I am a stronger person because no one can laughing of me because I am learning. "
3847,FD98A503573E,"Do you think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life?

some people said that positive attitude can help you in life.

positive attitude is the key to success in many ways in life.

I agree, because in many opportunity that you will have in life, is that you will know a lot of people in life with out positive attitude. One of the most important things that a person can have in life is positive attitude, if you are one of those persons with positive attitude, you will get more opportunity around the world.

In my own opinion positive attitude can help many people out there in life, having positive attitude can help a lot in the person. Example: when you go to work, if you have positive attitude you feel good all the time, also you will be able to talk with your friends in a way that you would not affect someone around you.

Those who have a positive attitude you will success in life. Example in my family, my grandparents has been successful in life only with positive attitude, they always have faith in the things that they will do, also one of my grandfathers said that all you need in the world or in a the work area is positive attitude, if you had that you will get all you want. in many opportunity that you will live in real life, is when you are ready to do something but you are not sure to do it, that's where you will put your positive attitude to do it on own place i would said that having good attitude is one of the best things that a human can have good attitude would give you more opportunity, when someone with positive attitude wake up at the morning the first thing that they do is smile at the mirror.

Positive attitude is a good thing to have but, some people with out positive attitude they think different in a way, that they dont know what are they are doing to be as the person that have positive attitude in life.

In the future positive attitude is going to be one of the most important thing around the world and also in your life.

conclusion if you have a good attitude you will successful in life. "
3412,EA4AED3BFE34,"Some schools permit their students use cellphones in classroom for educational purposes. There is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .They can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if it's for educational purpose.

I think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and that's what make cellphones a bad opction.

Some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. Also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. Students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes.

Allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. The bad effect for students can be :they are going to get distracting , they are not going to do their classwork,and for all that reasons they can lose their classes.

My first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class.

My second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed .

My third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource.

Some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us.

3327,E660157F81B4,"A lot of people ask for an advice, but others ask more then one person for an advice. An advice means talking to someone for a recommendation. Some people ask one person for an advice. Other people talk to different people. Talking to one person can help, but asking more than one person can help you understand something better. If i am about to do something that i can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for an advice.

I would ask different people for an advice, because i can understand something i could do better. Another good thing about asking for an advice is that if i go to like prison for murder, drugs or alcohol, in the future when i go look for a job nobody will want to hire me because of the stuff i did. If i am going to do something really bad in school i should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing. When i am having trouble doing something or understanding something i should ask others a advice of whats a good way or doing it.

I think that other people should really ask for a advice. If someone wants to do something bad that they can get in trouble or they can ask for an advice. Is someone wants to make new friends they can ask something for an advice to tell them how they can talk to new people. If i am having bad grades i can talk to my teacher to tell me how i can get my grades up. And that is why i think an advice means. "
3207,E0C521DEB367,I disagree with the school board because we not trying be in school more time in school. Also students need to have their own time outside of school with family and friends. I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. My other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. The county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them. That would help them with the decision and knowing what would be the impact on the students. This is my prompt to yall about if i agree or disagree.
3110,DC33D5F69792,"In China we don't have the thing that Ralph Waldo Emerson. I know Ralph Waldo Emerson think he is grow up because he beyond he has already mastered. In my opinion people are different, so not everyone can grow up from beyond the things his already mastered. If they beyond the game that they already have play the best, they are not grow up. And there are three reasons I disagree about what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote looking for new things and learn it make people grow, some small vital can make people grow up, and other vital matter can make people grow up. I am disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote.

People can look for new things and learn the things to grow up. The new things are not for human control. Students learn new things make their knowledge be more, they can grow up in this way. This is a example of my mom. When she first time can to America, she didn't know any English. She is learn English for three years, now she can talk a little bit English to other. Nobody can say she is not grow up, she learn a new Lagrange she never know before. In my mom story I know not the things you have already mastered in past make you grow up, the new things can make you grow up, too.

People can have many small things that they don't care make they grow up. In a science experiment if you get a small mistake, the all experiment will be destruction by that little mistake. People who learn science, if they make that small mistake they will get their master abusive, nobody knows if the experiment will make people change. I think this is a big things will make people who learn the science grow up. They can control it is happened or not. In this example I learn the little things happen let they know the mall will become the big thing than it will bother you life.

People can have many things in their life can make they grow up. When you go to the society, you will find it is so different between school and society. When you go to the work, you can feel effort is not the only choice, it is many way can get you go to the high lever. If you know this one, now you really become a adult. When you have a wedding with a girl. That will be you best time time, you grow up again. Then if you have a baby, you will get what is the really mean about responsibility. Responsibility make you get a word called grow up. Many things make people grow up the work, wife, kids, and other things make people really grow up.

Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" It may work for Ralph Waldo Emerson or other people, but I disagree what he say. People are different, they have many different way to make they grow up, not the only way like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. People can study new things to make their knowledge be more. They can learn the things from the small mistake that they made. They can grow up from society. In China it has so many reason make you grow up."
1511,745F880CEFA7,When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.
2240,A79B40F29DCA,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.

I used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them.

Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.

Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself

""what is the point of doing all this?"". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.

In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first."
2161,A1976FDEA9E2,"If I would pick a enjoyable activity it would be art. I

would picked art because you can do anything you want with it. The reason I

picked art was because a long time ago I would be sad or mad. So I went to the consular and she told me

I can use art. And how will

I use it? I would color what i felt and i would take my anger out its like telling someone what you feel except your drawing it.

My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that. For example if you had feather and bottles or cans you build a bird out of it. And even just painting something like a wall with difrernt kinds of color thats art.

Also it can be soothing because when you have a lot of tress you can paint. Because whe you paint and your trying to paint the beach it relaxing. For meits relaxing because whe you start to paint the brush won't be hard like a pencil it will just go by so soft you won't have to worry about messing up.

It's also great becauseyou get to learn about artist. Because it will kinda help you. Because it can tell you about how they draw or paint they can have a special way doing it. Like I read artist that used dots to paint and draw I thought that was enterested so i tryed it was kinda of hard. But I enjoyed trying it. This is why i like art becuase you can use it for anything. what is your favourte thing to do?       "

Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also be a helpful option for scholars with disabilities, or illness that might stop them to attend school.

Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes such as students not doing their assign work, or not passing the class due to less time with students. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future.

1281,623B7BD7613C,"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of you're friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality."
788,3D4475C949C2,"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home.

Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up.

Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate.

The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer.

Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home.        "
2434,B4CBDAF1161C,"Although some people say that classes such of art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves, actually some say that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area and in a short future they will be contributing to the culture of the nation.

Often people comment about the classes that students are taking on school. They are agree that art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves. As every person in this country we must let them take part of their own decisions. Let me remain you, when you were young there is a bunch of classes that you didn't like to take, you complaint a lot. It's the same with this classes. Students must decide what they want to do in order of their own benefit. Many students don't even care about those class and their grades look affected because schools required them to take those classes.

People suggest that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area. For instance we are in at school!. we are connected to other schools we can make events and build good relations between students in order to let them gain experience. as soccer, basketball, baseball, and football also we can create competitions to motivate them. the kingdom university during 3 years asked to 100000 people "" How do they feel about competitions""

and the 90% of people said, competitions motivate you, is not matter what kind of competitions the human nature always wants to win. In other to this some schools are more likely to invest money on those areas.

Culture is a good reason why students should be required to take art, music, and dramas classes. When we talk about culture we have to do mention that it does a huge contribution in the society. for example Tourism, some research showed that the 70% of people who travel to another countries just to know how their culture works. like in years before the music had been changing. The United States of America have long history in music like Jazz, Rock, Heavy Metal and so on. That's why music classes should be required for students to maintain the culture of music in our country. When we talk about art everyone has heard about the famous Leonardo da Vinci and his picture of the Mona Lisa. Outside there is good amount of artist who became famous because they impressed the world with fantastic pictures. drama, our world is a age where we use the social media for many reasons and social media need authors. Example Hollywood every year produce movies. All those authors have a really good home, cars, and many facilities to live. That's why students must be required to take drama classes because many of them can have the opportunity to enjoy a life like this.

Some say classes as art, music and drama should be electives for students because the own decision is important but classes such art, music and drama must be required because it give the students the opportunity to gain experience in those areas and contribute to the culture of our society and nation.

3649,F57B95D17755,"No not good for older and younger students to be in a program. But sometimes older kids become mean and don't care about the younger just care themself to have fun. It's not normal for that to happen and it will feel weird harder stuff for the younger ones don't know and the older kids think it's too easy. There's so much reasons that it shouldn't happen doesnn't feel right.

If it was like in the summer for an activity that would be great because you learn about how the older and younger kids are. The younger kids will want to do childess stuff and the older ones want to just be on there phones and just talk. Sometimes the older ones need to teach the younger ones to be more grown up so they learn about the older ones. The teachers mostly will try to tell the older ones to help the younger ones to be grown up.

So usually they shouldn't create schools like that it will feel completly different because there will be different stuff then real schools with older and older kids and younger and younger kids. The younger ones could sometimes scream and run or goof around a lot and the older ones sometimes will feel annoyed by them. So lot's times I feel like the older ones will feel unconfortable from the little ones. When you grow older you learn what you do now and not like when you were younger.

Most the time you usually want to be friends with people your age not too much of a different age. Sometimes it can happen to be friends with someone older or younger but most times your age. Always try to be yourself and not change your additude. Sometimes the older kids will need to try make the little kids happy by talking with them and have fun with them. But not for to long you should because it will get boring doing it for a long time. When u finshis they will sometimes try bothering you because they liked what you did but just leave them alone after.

These are examples why sometimes you should or shouldn't allow those schools with older and younger students. After when you grow older you the one teaching the new kids to be grown up. Try remeber the times you were little and what the older kids did to you do that with others. But there could be lot's of times younger ones a different and you were that way 8 years ago. Help everyone be a grown up kid and still think not too much they should add schools with older and younger kids."
744,395189B8B76B,"Many schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities. I would like to be selected to visit and learn about the work that interested me,

because it would help me to be prepare on my future is a great opportunity. One of the reasons that I would like to be selected is because that can help me to find the right job and to know how to do it ,and to learn about it more, Because I can have more experience on doing my job. For example if I have to do one thing I should know how to do it and is better to learn something before doing it.

Another reason is because not all schools have partnerships with companies to visit and learn about the work that interest students, that way I know what's the work that interests me by having that type of help on schools, By doing that type of help students learn new things and have more opportunity in life and have better jobs and have more money by doing the type of jobs that they want to have in there future is a great help for schools to have that. Students should already know what they want to learn about work.

I think that is a great help for schools to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment, so student learn more and they can find a job that they want that is why I want to be selected and visit and learn.

Those are great opportunity to discover whether students are interested in pursuing that type of employment."
2378,B083862AF3B4,"There are many students that has the possibility to take class at home. The students that take class at home are benefit because they don't need to leave from home, they can stay in home if are sick, and they can't be absent, because they always stay in home.

There are many reasons for explain that takes classes from home is a good idea, this are some of them:

First, the students that take class at home don't need to leave from home, nothing can detain take classes. The weather changes don't affect to take a class, if is snowing, raining or are a hurricane in the city.

The parents of the students that take class from home can be more unsuspecting, because they sons are in home, also this is benefit for the parents of students that take classes from home; they can be sure that nothing danger can be happen to they sons. The student don't have any excuses for be absent. This is good for the students because they at final a year has perfect attendance.

Second, the students that take class at home just can be absent, if they need to stay in home and don't take some class, they have the opportunity to explain to the teacher by text or just a call, then the teachers need to ask to your parents if is necessary don't take classes because you don't feels good. The students that take a regular classes in the schools can't do this because they need to be in the school everyday , if not in this case the correspondent sub school has the obligation to put absent in the class day.

Finally, the students that take class at home can't missing a class, they don't have the possibility to missing the bus or miss some useful for the school. The students can't forget the computer, pencil, notebook or other things that we use in school, because they have all classes online, this can be positive for the students that stay in home at care to they parents the student can't has some distractions that sometimes has in the school, like talk with any friend, use a inappropriate language to the teacher or don't pay attention, if can be some possibility to the student miss some class; they can take the missing class latter.

In conclusion, take a classes from home is a good choice because stay in home, do not have any absent if are sick, and don't missing class, are a good idea for take classes at home, the benefits that this have are good for parents and students that need to have more family time, or need to have more time with they sons. A reason that take classes in the schools take a big part time of students, this is a good choice because the students don't need go to the school just stay in home ,add that, this is a good choice for some students that need to stay in home, with they brothers or they parents."
3767,FA0A1D6FEE25,"I agree with Ralph Waldo's quote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you somthing else is the greatest accmplishment. In todays society everyone wants to be part of the wave to whatever is popular. People always go the extra mile to impress other people even if they have to change their style or the way they act. It's hard to be yourself in todays society so those who can do it have accmplished something great. Being yourself is better because then you'll find your real friends.

Students in Middle School and High School for whatever reason want to be cool. They think doing drugs, breaking rules and being disrespectful to others is cool. When they get home they're a different person. They're respectful, follow all the rules and don't do drugs because thats the way they are raised, They're being themselves. That shows the impact of what people consider being cool is.

Some students are at the wrong spot at the wrong time and start hanging out with the wrong group of people to be cool. This is important because they could be offered drugs or be offered to skip class. The students would say yes because they want to be cool knowing very well never to do it. This shows what could happen to a student who are trying to be cool. when they know to stay in school and never do drugs because that won't help your education it would only slow it down.

For example one of my friends was skipping school and doing lots of things he wasn't supposed to be doing. He thought he was cool and told everyone. I guess you could say he got cool from it but in the long run he suffered. This is important because while him trying to be cool he ended up getting bad grades and getting kicked out of school. The school gave him one more chance and made him go to the carrer center where students who fail usually go. This shows what could happen when you try to be cool.

Being yourself is the best thing you can accomplish because you wouldn't worry about most things other students wear or say. You would go further in life being yourself and becoming something you want to become. If your don't want to become a doctor and want to be a car machanic then that what you do. Being yourself would make you more happy then trying to fit in. "

High school students are graduating in three years because open more opportunity of life ,knowing the new world of college works,beneficial being a young student .

first,

1694,80CCEFCCD166,"Some may say that working in a group is better because you have people around you that can help you and support you. You dont have to depend on anyone when your working by yourself. Your focused more and when your focused no one can distract you. You could ask people for help if your confused on something.

You don't have to depend on anyone when working working alone because if you have a group and one of your group members doesn't show up then your screwed because now your missing a piece of your project or whatever the situation is. It's going to be hard when working by yourself because everything is depending on you. So you have to do everything on your own.

When your working by yourself you are more focused on doing the work. You could listen to music to keep you even more focused. Music keeps you relaxed and calm. You want your work to be nice and organized so that the reader can understand what's going on. Also you can use the internet to help search information. You can also ask someone for an idea or for a little of help."
322,1736153EF81F,"Well, I feel that working with a group is better than working alone. In my opinion is more easy to work with other people and you can be sociable working like that ,there's a lot benefits and reasons why I prefer more work together than work alone. Let me explain what are my reasons why I prefer work in a group and why I don't like to work alone.

First of all, I prefer work together because is more easy and you can finish your work quicky. For example, is you work in group of three, one member can search for the information about the topic, another member can make a poster showing examples about the topic and the last one has to organize how they are going to present and explain the topic. However, if I work alone I have to do all the work by my own, and it can takes a lot time to finish the project.

Second of all, Working together is so funny you can talk with your classmates about the topic, and having good discussions. I feel comfortable working in a group and I enjoy working like that, because they share their opinions with you, even you can learn more from your classmates than the information of the topic, it can be strange,but it is true you don't know how much they know about the topic. Sometimes you can't understand the topic, but you have your group and ask questions to them, and they can help you to understand the topic.

Third of all, Working in groups can be sociable, you can have a good time knowing new people and make new friends. I think is good be sociable because you can learn new things about them and you can develop your knowlege getting the new information from your classmates. For example, if you don't know anythink about history and you are in a group, and you ask who knows something about history and someone likes history you can aks him about it, and you can get new information about history and at the same time you are being sociable. However, if you are working alone, you can't ask to anybody because you dont know them.

In conclusion, that's are the reasons why I prefer working in a group. Working together can be easy you can share the work with your group, you can have a good time with your classmate talking about the topic , and you can develop your friendship making new friends."
1462,70E490A83717,"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?

In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?

In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and review's for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.

In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer.

For example, That is one of the problem that happen on many schools cause let's say when teacher tryed to explain us something about the intimate section they star to Idle when this is no funny. Also Thomas Jefferson inspire peopler to help others when they was idle to a inoccent people.

Additionaly we can stop the kind of problem if we work together helping each other.

It's wonderful if peolpe work as a community and tryed to help other,cause Thomas Jefferson was a men who like to help people on what he can. When someone else was Idle to you don't put attention and keep figthing on what you want .Like everyone know we have different talens and always one person of them was jealousy and tryed to Idle you cause he don't want you or someone else progress more them he that unfair everyone have different dreams and work hard vfor what they want.

On my opinion wse can work as a group and tryed to stop those peolpe who Idle others. Also we can do something else cause lety's said if vsomeone Idle otyhers and we bdon't help these guys the problem continued and repeat cuade anyone work with the kind of problem.

something else was some people don't like to help others. That cause that kind of problem but we as a community we can work on that and tryed to stoped."
2460,B727B720430B,"To whom it may concerned:

For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2. For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice. Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes.

As long as their phones are in silence or they won't be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice. And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, there's a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble. But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus.

Students shouldn't be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever they're inside their classrooms. Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets. I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school.

Sincerely yours,

Where i would like to visit

3/21/18

If I had to choose a place to visit i would choose Brazil. I would go to Brazil to learn and expertise many new things. I could learn how to speak Portuguese, I can find out how Brazilian food is or i could even learn how to make it. I would even go and see one of the famous parades held in Brazil, one of my friends went to Brazil to see the parade and he said ""It was beautiful."" Going to Brazil would be great.

I would like to learn Portuguese because I could get along with the people and even be friends with them. I could even ask for directions if i didnt know where i was going.

I would like to try out Brazilian food. I would want to try it because I never had it. It would want to know how it taste and if i like it i would try to learn how to make some of their foods. I would try to make it because I could make it at home and never forget about my experience with Brazilian food.

I would like to go and see the Fantastic Parade in Brazil. I would see it and take many pictures and never forget about it. I would like to know how it feels to watch a parade that everybody loves.

If i go and do all of this i would never forget about it. I would always remember the good times i had in Brazil. I never forget about the expertise I had.                         "
1002,4D23A7FA9408,"Although some say students wouldn't benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home because they will feel comfortable and students can be more safe.

Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects just because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas.

However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried for their child's safety.

As you can see students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can't stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure. "

2831,CE2EC298670A,"I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them can't go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. and is a very good experience. If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example

Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them.

Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.

Also the family of the students can not affords the students education.

The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.

I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.

First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.

Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.

Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future.

The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. And don't leave their kids with another person many time. And spend more time with them.

In conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. And also the people that does not have their family in this country. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. For does that when they were in the school have some problems. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work. Finally the distance education is a good ideas because help people with the things they want and that they need too.    "

376,1CB9668F242D,"There are so many enjoyable ways to spend time outdoors. That is bike riding,skateboarding,rollerskating,

surfing,scuba-diving,camping,hiking,rock climbing, and snow boarding. However,the most people enjoy doing are skateboarding and bike riding. Mostly,during the summer,friends gather around the neighborhood and teach themselves how to skateboard and bike ride.

However,most parents disagree with having their children ride bikes and skateboard. Most parents think that their children are going to get abducted,raped,kidnapped or get hurt. Some parents also think is a good idea for their to children to skateboard and ride bikes outdoors,so they can cope with talking to people. Well I think is a bad idea for children to ride and skateboard in the Summer alone without parental guidance, because it takes a lot of training and focus to bike ride or skateboard. Some people can even scuba-dive if they have the experience. Most people like to spend time outdoors,for example,they can invite some friends over for some barbecue.

People like to spend time outdoors doing fun stuff like Snowboarding. Snowboarding is a cool way of spending time outdoors,because a lot of children like to play in the snow,so snowboarding is a fun way of playing in the snow. There are so many outdoor events like,Easter and partying. A lot of children like to hunt for Easter eggs during Easter,because they find eggs,candy and so on. Sometimes,most people like to go to outdoor-clubbing to chill,relax, and relieve stress. Some other people don't like to spend time outdoors during the night because they either don't have time or they have important things to do.

Mostly,during the Summer,most parents take their children outdoors to teach their kids how to ride their bikes. Eventually,people might find the activities mentioned above enjoyable,because they get to tell their friends their parents thought them how to ride a bike and skateboard,they could assist their friends. People like to spend time outdoors with friends than stay home alone and do nothing. They could try and teach themselves how to ride their bikes. If parents stay outdoor with their children on a campsite,they could make smores with a campfire and enjoy.

In conclusion,people should stay out more often so they can learn how to snowboard,skateboard,bike ride,rock-climb,roller-skating,surfing,camping,hiking,scuba-diving and jet-skiing.              "
2483,B88EA53BC496,"Of course you accomplish more if you are always doing something.

Sitting down on your behind trying to accomplish your goal or your dream will never come. Get up go grind for it , go plan for it,

set steps you will take to accomplish that goal of yours. Now if your sitting down doing nothing how will you ever accomplish anything if you are putting no work into your craft. Nothing in life is given to you , get up off your behind and WORK.

. Some of the greatest athletes in the world like Larry Bird, Michael Jordan , and Lebron James all had to get up every morning and train master their craft before the can be great and accomplish the amazing milestones they accomplished in their careers .. Before every game Larry Bird would shoot 100 3-pointers because that was his craft. Lebron James was fresh out of high school and trained then ended up getting drafted. Do you think if some of the greatest athletes in the world would be able to do what they do if they sat around and waited for it to come to them?.

Same thing with money , you think you can just sit at home all day eat,drink,sleep and watch TV all day and think money is just going to fall out of the sky?. Money requires work, and sitting at home on your couch all day will not get you a profit i can guarantee you that . I understand that yea maybe sometimes you should sit back and let things play out but no the more you let that happen the more time you are wasting in life.

One of the best NFL football Running Backs ever to play was Walter Payton. He was not your average RB . He had a hill in his neighborhood he ran everyday which separated him from the other players in the rest of the NFL players. In the off season 90 percent of the League goes idle but nope not him he worked and trained everyday, you know where that lead him to ? Lead him to the top 10 rushing yard list of all time. The people who work everyday all day will and comes back the next day to accomplish more will have more accomplished when they are dead and gone.

Everyone should want to accomplish something nice in life and work and constantly striving to do better 24/7 and trust me it will happen.     "
3016,D80ED2446C0E,"Setting examples by your own behavior to influence other people is better for many reasons but still has its pros and cons.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them. In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. You can ask a smart adult and act upon there actions and carry it on. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

In conclusion setting examples by your own behavior to influence others is a smart thing to do and you'll be surprised by how many people youv'e influenced.             "

2927,D2E545CFEBF3,"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy.

For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades.

My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng

2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school.

I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle.    "
1888,8E64BE4119C3,"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.           "
2057,9B15B90564A3,"I think that they should not do a homework club because what if students don't got time for that. A other reason would be is that many students don't do their homework nowdays so it was just be a waste time for the teachers unless they are getting paid extra for staying after school now thats a differnt story. A other reason is what if none of the students stayed after school the school would have to be sure if students would a tend this homework club. Students should be able to do thier homework on there own to be honest so that way they learn more cause maybe the teacher might be giving the students the answers and that's just not right! My other reason why they shouldn't do the homework club is what if most teachers don't give out homework like i don't get a lot of homework but maybe somone else wouldn't get homework. Would any teachers parpicate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would argee on doing this club? How long would this homework club be a hour or 30 minutes at what would it end because students have stuff to do out of school. Do pranets know about this club would they let their childiren stay after schook is a way for them to get home if anyone can't pick the student up?? Would this homework club interfir with any other after school clubs or what if students already do a club and they need help with homework but they can't go to the homework club because they have to go to the club they do. Does the whole school want to do this or just some students cause not this club would be worthless. In conlusion i think that they should not do the homework club."
1726,82DE4E49CC52,"Thomas Jefferson wrote determine never to be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, people can accomplish if we are always doing something, people can follow his purpose what they want because all people can done with want they accomplish in ours life its many things that can we do something.

First, People like to be idle with other people like in some works when they do not want to employed in his works just because they have a inability personal but if people want to accomplish. They can doing something like in his home or a thing easy that they can make, for follow living but some people something just think about what they want to make his purpose but they never do something.

Second, People can follow his purpose and doing something wonderful, but if they do not are idle for example in some works like that people who work. in some place the boss are idle and that do that people leave that job for his idle personality it is wonderful if people do something good for his life because, some people do things bad and that happen that in some place never proposed something.

Third, In some place or country are bad, because people do not accomplish to have a good country because they do not do something good, for example something steal person, and happen that country accomplish a purpose we need to accomplish what we can or what we what for ours life, and do not be idle because are idle do not help for make something better for ours life, so we need to have patience with want we accomplish.

We need to doing something good for examples, people that work in office need to be amiable with people that need something most of the people who work in office do not have to be idle. Also be a wonderful person in jobs like restaurant help to have more client but depend how the people serve. So first to all we accomplish more if we are always doing something for ours life and do not do bad things that do not help for what to accomplish so we need to think first the things and glide that things what we want to do.

1804,88006889B561,"First impressions are not ""almost impossible to change"". They can be difficult to change, but they aren't almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is ""how can I change my own first impression?""

A lot of people say it's almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they don't realize is that they aren't thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they aren't almost impossible to change, so they instead just don't even try and use more of their cognitive ability. What's important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others.

When you use more of your cognitive ability, then you'll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once you're able to come up with a better first impression; you'll find it easier easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how you'll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop

(also don't over think it because this can cause stress and also won't help you use more of your cognitive ability).     "
3462,ECF265A73C7E,"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students don't have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house.

A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school.

This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school.

In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher won't let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school.

The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work."
3653,F584D9BB5F5C,""" Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a positive or negative affects on people's lives?"". As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy.

First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day.

With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends.

We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others.

Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and it's not all right. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. It is a best way to know our friends, family members' activities without asking because we don't have too much time to speak with them everyday. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them.

Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so let's try using it as limited as we can and don't forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes."

1262,60FD2E2FB768,"Imagine you are in school and you had to sit an a room with four wall. Moreover, you had a frustrating day because of teachers, students and school work. And then you had to stay in that room for another one and a half hour. How would you feel after all of that? Beside, students might not function well, since there is more class time which means more classwork and homework. That is why the school board should not add one and half hour to the school day.

First, some students have sports, clubs and many things to do after school. However, they are tired from the school and school work as a result, they will not function right. For example, my friend plays soccer and she had school for another one and half hour when she went to practice she passed out, since her brain was not function nether were her body. An addition, when students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside. Which is a unfair for students and it's bad for the students safety.

Next, students will not have time to spend with there family members nor there friends because they would have homework and projects to do. Neither will teacher have time to spend with there kids, since they have test to grad and paper work. In the same token, students would not be motive to play or have fun because all they would think about is school. Beside, the students will not have a lot of time to sleep.

Furthermore, one day the students will not have the energy to go to school. Similarly, they will become depressed and have a negative mood. And the students might not even want to come to school any more. Which put the students in a high risk.

In conclusion, The school board should not add one and half to the school hours. Students will not function well, since there is more class time which means more class work. Additionally, some students have sports and many things to do after school. However, when the students get back from school or sport it will be dark outside which is bad for the students safety.

692,3550660EE2EC,"A enjoyable educational activity is when I was doing a science experiment wewas building a volcano. It irupted we was all smiling because we didnt know it was gonna work. we put soda inside the volcanoe and we shaked it a little and then put mentos it went high. we had to clean it up after there was a mess every where but it was fun. As soon as everybody left I was taking to the teacher to ask her wat I got.

He told me that I got a B and I got mad because I got a B I was all like how and he told me that there was soda every where. it was messy and it had mentos in it and I was like please give me an A or can i at least remake it. He was like you can have one more chance to remake it I was all like thank you. it took me a while to make it and think what I can do so it wont spill anywhere. So I thought of putting a cone around the volcano put I was all like nah because whats the whole point of putting it if you cant see it.

I got an idea I put a lighter in side and a put a special paint that blows up with just fire. it can not make a mess I dont have to clean the floor I think this the best idea. i did it and i tryed it out at my house and it always blew up every where and I kept on thinking and thinking but I had no idea Ithought that it had to much paint and iI kep on putting it little by little.

It kinda worked if I put a little in a bootle and light it like that but thene I had an idea that if a put newspaper under it and let it burn it will help it and it did and then i kept putting more and more news paper it took like 16 news of paper and my brother helped me do it it was hard because i didnt know which way to put it. I got it all finished and I took it to school.

It was my turn i represented the volcano I lit it on fire and the whole volcano fell and I was mad. after school the teacher called me and told me.''you did a great job but it failed but guess what you get an A for at least trying'' I was so happy I didnt belive it I did it."

If you want to get a good job you need to prepare, and study to get more opportunities. If you try to do something new you can grow up.

In addition, if you try to do something new, you can be a professional person.

3489,EE9EA950AAE1,"An enjoyable educational activity.

I think that a enjoyable activity for education wiil be a game y math like work in a group of 3 to 5 persons each person in the group to to answer a question, if they get the question right they get a point but if they don't they don't get any point, the group with more points get some candys for they exelent job doing what they are hate to do.

I think this a perfect activity because kids like to compete each other and is better when they know that if they win they get some candys.

Another enjoyable activity will be in science, doing a project of how animals live what thay ate and how they survive to the other animalto and give some importants facts to the teacher ,

i think this project may be of two persons because a think this will be to easy for them and there may be some student doing the project by them self.

I think that will like the project because they can get to know about an animal life and importants stuff about it and they can have fun with friends.

I choose math and science because this are my favorites subjects and i enjoy doing them with my friends and my teachers my favorite part is when we get to work in group that is in science, but in math my favorite part is when i get a question right some time the teacher give me some candys. "

Agree : you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered .

Disagree : you don't do nothing beyond what you have already mastered .

Nothing is impossible , you need to trust yourself and do something more than you know , you can do it with someone else , you can grow more and more . The way of success will come to you .                                                                                    "
1379,6A47B80F3283,"I believe, the schools which ones offers distance classes for students is a really good option for alot of people for a several reasons.

Some persons wants to finish carriers of schools, but they cant for this reasons.

- They does not have much time to do it,

because they have to work, pay bills and stuff like that.

-Some students get out of the schools becauses they wants to help their family , and pass more time with them; take caring of they youngues bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house.

Taking classes at home wil be the better options for the studens which ones wants to conitinue their carrier after high school, into the university,becasuse they can have a time to work, and to pay they carrier , and to get done what they wnats to be and their future ...

Some carriers are really expensives, and a parents cant pay for it. Well the students can work and get many. And the same time with this programs they can still continue with they classes .

Also begin home taking a classes, should be a better more consentration and relaxing eating an apple, least worrys and getting ready for a better future. Doing classes work and the free time and having time to do others staff.

Classes a distance, will be the better option for alot of peoples, they can have time to do many things done at the same time .

work,take of they kids, have time free for your own and, with their family. Takinf a classes at home are the best way for those peoples wanst to finish they carriers in Universities or High Schools ."
1290,62EDBC22A953,"I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.

Success are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.

The important role of failures on success is that, if you don't fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.

Now, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. I'll say, once my aunt told me ""Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on"", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.

There was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself ""You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you"". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.

Failures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.

Some people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.

In conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.

More than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life."
1467,7155F142CE58,"Some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Others think that inactivity also serves a purpose. They argue that they are not focus and they are not learning. One should always accomplish a goal if one puts their mind to it. they gain new knowledge,skills, and information.

If one has the knowledge he can accomplish anything. I wanted to learn how to make a dog house. I had no knowledge on how to build a dog house. My friend had told me that the school was having a science fair and that they were giving knowledge on how to build a dog house. I went and I had got the knowledge that i needed. I had the knowledge to stat it and to finish it. The dog house came out looking pretty good with the help of knowledge that I had. If one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has the skills to accomplish a goal he can can do anything. When i was in school I wanted to improve my skills in English. I would ask mt teacher to give me tips on what I needed to improve. She would tell me me not to use the word you. By the end of the year I was not using the word you. She had told me that my English skills were improving because I had been working on it all year. She told me that i was a strong writer. If one has the knowledge, skills , and information he can accomplish anything.

If one has information he can accomplish any goal in his way. When i was in high school I wanted to take welding as a class. I had no information on how to join the class. I asked my friend on how i could join he told me that I had to go to the office to get the information that I needed. With the information that I got I now had to fill it out so that I could join the class next year. if one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything.

If everybody in the community had the Knowledge ,skills, and the information then everybody would accomplish a goal. Although others think that they should not be focused on accomplishing a goal. One should have theses skills so that they can accomplish anything that they want.         "
1560,77B932D27C9E,"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three year and enter college or the work force one year early.

The students will have a all year they can use. If they graduate one year ealy it would help they in college or after college, it would be helpful for them in their future job too.

The students will be able to experience a early college, and they will be able to take their time to get everything they need for their life after college, it will also help some of them in the job they dicide to do, they will have time to get more experience for their job.

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

Graduating in three year will help the students alot, it may take alot of effort, but its a gift and they will be the ones to get something out of it, that's why the students should be able to de everything they can to be successful in their ealy graduation programe. They will have to take courses during the summers and probably in the evening, some may not be able to take elective courses, but it will help them alot in their lifes.

I think that it's a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early, because it will be very helpful for them in their lifes, it will give them the chance to eperience college or work force a year early, and they will have one more year to prepare their futrue.

217,1087B6C7FB98,"I say its a good idea that the school menu should change to being more healthier because a lot of students eat junkfood mostly everyday, need to eat more fruits and vegetables, and wanting a healthy live.

As you know, students eat junkfood food anywhere they go to such as movie theaters, gas stations, and restaurants. Some places do serve healthy foods and snacks but people rather choose junkfood because they're not use to eating good. Most stores put the unhealthy foods in the front, so kids can go straight into putting it in their carts or baskets. However, we can't manage telling people if they want to eat healthy or not.

Every school want kids to get a fruit or a vegetable at lunch. Some kids chose not to get a fruit or vegetable because they dont care about eating it or they it just throw away. Eating veggies will help you with your body like for an example; a carrot will help with your eyes. If kids dont want to get any of their fruits or veggies they could give it to a friend that will love to eat it instead of wasting it.

Eating healthy will not cause you to have much problems but, eating unhealthy will cause much problems. I think parents should focus on what their kids are eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you dont like eating unhealthy you could always pack lunch. Although, you could eat junkfood once or twice a week and not everyday.

I personality agree to having the school changing the school menu because the world has change and we want to eat more fruit and veggies, having our lives healthy, and wanting kids to stop eating junk food all the time. It has been an issue for the past years and I think its time for schools to have different types of food. Not everyone wants to eat healthy food we could sometime have some unhealthy at lunch. These are the reasons I want the school menu to change.                             "

3196,E07B043F3C2B,"People should seek guidance for help, because like us are still having trouble in the real world even if we graduate from high school or college, we even still have trouble trying to make our live easy. Having guidance is always helpful and learn something new.

Reason to have guidance is to release stress or don't add more stress. In daily hours people get stress out a lot at work and could get out of the control very easy,getting help from another one is good idea so you know what you doing and how you doing it. People stress things out and they don't know about what causing it, that give even more stress and have a chance to get an heart attack and lose motive to do work. Guidance could help us by rethinking our plans or working. While taking a guidance you could learn more things that we didn't know of.

Having guidance will also help you keep tack in time and help everything more clean in your work space. It good idea to have an open mind and have work done easier and fast. Having an open mind can give a good mind set in life and think more a head in time and saving time.

Another reason is people have depressing life or have health issuer. Depressing is a big thing that come to life in everyone and it cause a lot problem the way they living. Most of the population on earth have depressing in their life, so it a good idea to seek help at all time. People who having that need get some help from guidance right away to tell them what going on in their life, it could help them cure their depressing.

It a bad idea to to let people guide they own way without any help at all, because trying teach yourself is hard enough, and try to teach yourself might get even more worst because they mind might be wrong and could cause more problem in later runs. People rather do it on their own and not get help because it might give them false inform that they need to learn or think it a waste of time, but guidance are here to help. Having guidance will always help you and they always teach you more things. People can still guide on they own way, but it better to get guidance. It be more easier and get better in live in the long run.

In conclusion, guidance are here to help release stress, learn better, get thought life, cure depressing, saving time, give more open mind it, have work done in time, and make life little bit more easy."
2232,A6BE0FAFA04B,"Technology has given us humans positive and negavtive effects in life. For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isn't just physical contact there is cyber bullying and that's were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social.

One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everyday's life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because there's creations all over the world being created everyday.

Human contact is what we expect but now a days we can't find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work,school,sports teams and more. So human contact can be limited now days but there isn't any change becaue more and more techonlogy keeps coming towards our way and we can't stop it.

In conclusion this is what I think about technology ive given positive and negative feed back about technology on human contact."
3353,E7EFD51B632F,"The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Those examples sets an image in people's minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives.

The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called ""

I Have A Dream

"" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites' racist segregation laws. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites' segregation laws was.

The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset.

The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration.

In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals."
259,12F2BF34883F,"I do agree wih Emerson's statement, because i've had past experiences where i did not know a thing but then i started to get better at it by practicing on what i wanted to get better at. There is this game that got really popular last year it was called fortnite and everyone was playing it, so I decided to download it and play it because it was free.

I was playing and did not know what I was doing I didn't know how to build or shoot or run i didn't even know where I was at , I started playing more often and got my first win with my friends and then I started learning how to build and strategies to get kills, but i honestly didn't like it so I stopped playing for a while and played different games that I liked more because this game seemed to childish for me to play. After a while my friends would tell me to play so I would but I got bored and played different games, then a new season came out on the game and I had money so I bought it and after that everything changed.

I really started to like it now because it had a good storyline and it was more fun, I knew how to play so I would just goof around then I really started to practice with my friends and decided to stop playing around we would fight one on one's to practice i would lose but i just kept going and going until I would get more kills now i've been playing for 7 seasons which is a very long time, seasons are usaually 60 to 80 days in the game they aren't like seasons in real life like spring or summer their like tv shows how they have new seasons and stuff like that.

Anyway I do agree Emerson's statement because on how much better at I got at the game and how long i've been plaiying and the experience I have in that game, I started out really bad at it than started getting better and better the more I practiced and played. Not only me though I know people who started out around the same time I did which was in season two and they were just as horrible as I was now it's season eight and some of them are even better than me.

I also agree with Emerson's statement because i used to fail in math since I was a little kid than last year when i was in 10th grade i had a good math teacher who would help me alot and after a lot of work and help that was the first time i passed math and also this year to had a teacher who do the same she helped me a lot and I passed that class too."
2351,AEDDD593BF0F,"Ralph Waldo Emerson is the author. He wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with his statement. Because he didn't give up to write a statement. For example, Generic_Name wanted to give up for the driving lesson. But Generic_Name thought, ""If I am not gonna take the driving lesson anymore, I can't go far anywhere."" So, he didn't give up and took the driving lesson. After that, he got a driver's license. After he got a driver's license, he can drive anywhere. He drives very well after he took the driving lesson.

Another example, Generic_Name wants to be a scientist. So, she is studying a science. Also, she is doing lab with the experiment materials in the laboratory. But, there are many hard science problems, and experiment materials. So, she wants to give up, and get another job that can do easy way. But, she decided to don't give up for her job. So, she didn't give up to be a scientist. She studied hard, and researched how to succeed in the experiment. After she did that, she got a job scientist. She realized, ""If I give up, I can't do something later."" So, she is doing hard for her job, scientist.

When you give up, it will be hard to succeed, and get the benefit."
3692,F73899060D94,"Do you remember when you decided what you wanted to be? ''your character will be what yourself choose to make it''.Do we choose our own character traits,or is our caracter formed by in fluences beyond our control.

I agree Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. because, you make your own desicions,you take responsability,and you have goals. However many,believe that people influence the way we choose our characters because they think they have the rigth to critize the way people decides. Actually,this is a bad idea because people makes their own decisions,In society most of the time we have to take a decision whether are rigth or wrong we must take it at some point but is also,your choice to make the best out of it. For example,My brother had to take a decision by himself which was doing something in life going to collage study or work as an Mcdonals co-worker he decided the best was going to collage and keep studying. If,my brother wouldn't have taken that decision then he had lost an opportunity to make it.

The second reason your character will be what your self choose to make it, is that you take responsability because taking responsabilities make a better character of your self. For example,when you wake up early just to be on time at work every day you feel you are giving the best of you yourself are choosing to make your character. If,you are not giving the best of you every day that means you are no choosing to make your own character.

The third reason your character will be what your self choose to make it,is that you have goals because you want to feel satified when you have achieve something important in your life. For example,when getting your first bachelor degree when getting your dream job or you worked so hard for your dream car you always wanted. If, you don't have goals to follow then you are no going to make it.

In conclusion,make your own path,you are encharge,and you have dreams to follow.           "

Eduction is important because without a eduction you can't get a job. A job can get you money. money can get you a lot of things like clothes, house and food.

385,1D327ADD95AA,"Whether the limitation of human contact due to technology has had a positive or negative effect on people's lives, is a constant topic of discussion. Technology is an amazing tool, with countless positive effects. It has made society what it is today. Without it people would not know life the way that it is now. Technology makes many activities in life possible, which before would have been impossible. The first man to walk the moon did it by the means of technology. The vehicles which allow people to commute to work, or travel the world, were also created through technology. Buildings are powered with technology and our houses are to. Our whole world is surrounded by technology, and without it people would not live life the way that they do now. If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started.

Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. People's phones, computers, and even TV's now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted.

Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era.

People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience. Browsing thousands of items, and ultimately finding the best price is an activity which can keep people entertained for plenty of time. Shopping online is much easier, and comfortable than actually going to the stores to find the items that are needed.

Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again."

2249,A87C80DEAB08,"People use to say that working make better life. In now days people who are self-reliance define as they need people to follow their instincts or ideas and their is also people who are usually follow their own ideas. Both of them are working ways that are preferred to people, But I think that people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters, Because it will make their life easier and help people who are having troubles in their life. There are a lot of thing that we cloud talk about people asking help from expert,But I got two of the story that I want to talk about and made peoples life easier.

The first example is a true story that happened to me when I was young. It was a summer in 2010, I was in a summer camp for basketball at Generic_City, It was the first practices day and I was so happy, Because I could finally start to have real training for basketball. At that time I was in a private school that have no sports, So the only way that I cloud play sport is going to camp in summer time. Well that day at middle of the practice I hurt my ankle because of my teammate so I had to stay in hospital. In hospital I thought that I will not able to play sport anymore so I was really upset about it, When I was thinking about that, My father told me that life is easy and hard some time and life will never follow the step that people go, so they have to be stronger to be able to control their own life so they will not follow the step that other people went, After my father told me that I start to realize that life ain't easy so I have to be way more stronger than before so I could be better me in future and it happened now, So that is the reason that I think with others help peoples life will be way easier than before.

The second example is a story that my mother told me when I was a child. It is a story about a young man trying to make a hammer. It was a winter in long time ago, there was a young man that live in a really old house, At one day he was trying to make a hammer so that will help him to make a new house. So he traveled a lot of place to find a perfect iron for that hammer, In the way to find perfect iron he found so many iron that's not perfect in his eyes. But in one day he found a old man that are making a hammer, when young man came close to old man he found out that is the perfect iron that his finding all day long so he asked old man how did he found the iron, After old man heard what he said he laughed and said"" young man in this world nothing is perfect if you trying to make a hammer like me you have to make everything equally, And nothing is perfect on lest you treat them perfect."" After old man told everything to young man he realized that the iron that he think is not perfect is perfect if he treated is nicely and in the end he made a normal hammer that could really help him in the future. After my mother told me this story I realized that with older help you will know a lot of things that you never knew before, And this is the second reason that I think that with experts help your life will be better and you will learn a lot of life's matter than before.

Some people often think that they will decide everything by their self, And there are some people are seek guidance from experts and authorities. But I think that people should ask form expert and authorities help, Because it will make people's life easier and help people who are having trouble in there life. There are a lot of expert that helped me a lot, And I think that it will help all the people who is having trouble in their life."
3785,FA9386DCB8DD,"Imagine going to a country full of beautiful places to go to. A lot of new technology to look at or to observe. That is why the one place I want to visit is Generic_City because it has a lot of beautiful places to visit and they have a lot of new technology.

Generic_City has great places to visit. The first place I want to see is the sky buildings. The sky buildings touch the the clouds (that is the reason why people call them sky buildings). The second place is the wooden bridges. These wooden bridges can across forests. The final place is the gardens. The gardens have all of the plants on Earth. These are the greats place that Generic_City have.

Another reason why I want to visit Generic_City is that they have one of the best technologies. One of the best technology they have is robots. In my opinion, robots are difficult to make because it has a lot of bits and pieces to put together. Another best technology they have are air bots. Airbots deliver the food or items to your house. The final new technology is trains. The trains do not touch the ground. The hover over the ground. These are the new technologies the have.

1606,7A68E1FB7863,"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home.

While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary.

To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager.

In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they don't want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didn't expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students.

As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher don't give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.        "
3635,F4E879AE7FBA,"The greater danger for most of us is setting our aims too high and falling short because many people try to aim for something that's imposible for them to accomplish, falling short on your goal will make you want to give up, and not having the motivation and energy will get you no where.

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accoplish it.

For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's imposible because no one is perfect.

Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en they're wasting their time.

The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high.

Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short.

Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure.

This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for.

Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer.

Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people don't have a motivation or energy that they get no where in life. Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be albe to accoplish their goals.

Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set.

The great artist Michelangele once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

Setting your aims low and achieving your marks is not the great danger or a danger. However, setting your aim too high and falling short is a great danger because you can learn from it.            "

It's an sound affect you would see when you are reading a book or watching a cartoon here are some examples for this word the owl whoosh away flying as quick whoosh is a sound affect when watching a cartoon you could seen the character falling then you see the word boom when he falls. People really get confused with simile or metaphor when they see it or and personafaction and hyperbaly it almost means the same thing but they are not. Onmanpia it the easiest but hard the write half of the people that first start to learn this have a hard time one. saying it's name or two. writing it because for sure I did. What is simile? well simile is when there is like or as in it there are ways like he is as sad as the clouds there are two thing they are comparing it too and it has as but metaphor could have as or like in it but still wouldn't be a simile. You could say as I was walking I stumble across an old friend of mine your using as in the sentence that's a metaphor. It is important for you to know this so when you are reading or watching t. v or something this lesson will remind you about what you just learned. Personafaction is a long and confusing word but the meaning for this long word is almost the same as hyperbaly y'all already know what's the meaning but personafiction is used in sentences like the clouds don't look very happy they look mad the meaning for this is that it looks like it's about to rain. really tricky to not get hyperbaly or personafaction correct.
2,00299B378633,"Dear, Principal

If u change the school policy of having a grade b average that unfair. Because many students have a C average. So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves but we shouldn't take the other students away from the others ones. If we do this policy student will try to raised their grade but if they cant what happens they them. Should they just be out of it and think that schools boarding. If they do this its like taking away their video games. All I'm saying is that they have the right to go out for sports or activities."
1349,67F6FEDD7677,"Some schools have programs for youngers and olders student why they make programs like this or how can they help each others Okey. This program help both students to learn about what are the responsability of the olders students and the youngers student to see what they going to do when they becomes a older and the olders student can learn from de younger student.

The olders student can teach about mistake because every one have different mistake they can teach younger student to do right things and can help each others

The yourger student can also learn about theres mistakes they make the program to thye olders students can go to visit the yourger student to help them, to them they can help the youngers student to learn from theres mistakes the olders student can teach the younger student about the life to do the right things

The youngers student needs the olders student like the olders student need a adult to they can say dont do this is the same the younger student need the olders student they can help each others if the youngers studetn have a promble or a question they can ask the olders student to do right this some student of the youngers schools they dont know english the olders student can help them some times the olders student needs the youngerts students to do somenthing like if the olders sstudent dont know somenthing they can ask the younger students if someone has problems with something they can help each others they can do many dinfferent things together there are many types about programs that can help younger students and olders student sometimes if is a fight with youngers students the olders student can stop them and say to them to do the right thins because in this life everyone has mistakes nobody is perefect they can help each others to the rights things and the different about this two kinds of student is the olders student have more responsability and the younger student have responsabily but the dont have much like the olders students or the olders students dont have the mu\ch responsability from the adult one time my dad tell me that when he was youngers he need help with somenting but he dont want to tell a older person he tell me if one time i need help with something i can ask a older one to help me to do tghe right this and to learn from ours mistakes we can help each others olders students are important because they can help the younger student to know about this life the younger students start to learn more about this life the olders student know what is right and what not right they can help each others to practice the armony of this two kinds of students the youngers student can learn much about thir sames mistakes know a big problem has the olders student dont want to help the youngers students the diferent betweet is the olders student know the right things and the bads things so thas why the can help each others

Also in betwen thius two kinds of student are a different types somentimes the olders studeents dont want to help the youngers students and the younger student dont want to listeng from the olders student so theirs is a problem somentimes the olders student want to teach somenthing important to the younger student ,and the younger student dont want to listeng the olders student so we have a different there like now the oplders student dont want to listeng the aldult or theirs teachers so whent someone says dont do this more you do it and when the consecuense cames we dont want that so my we need the olders student to teach as to know what is good or bad like the olders student need a adult to they cant tell them dont do this or do this but they cant hit them they can only tell them don't do this this is bad for you or what is good for you they need thir helps esch others they can proctect each others                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "
2650,C41E40F2D803,"Do you know how many careers' choices you have when you enter to high school? Most of the new students in high start thinking about what career they would like to take after they finish high school. Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure, actually students should commit to a career at a young age because help students to preparate for the future and they have more time to choose the career they like.

Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure. In most cases students become stressed because of their parents telling them to start selecting a career at a young age. Students behavior change; However their grades get affect it bacause of the stress and pressure. Some people say that school should talk to students' parents, so students don't feel pressure selecting a career at a young age. When the parents know they have a lot time before collage.

First reason why students should commit a career at a young age because help students preparate for the future and let them know what is better for them. Students preparation is base on saving money to pay for collage. They can see what is better for them; In other words what career benefit them more and if they allowed to pay it. Students can know early where they can get help either from their parents, or if they has to work for the career that they want. Students can talk with their parents aboout a student loans too.

Second reason why students should commit a career at a young age because they have more time to look for a career that they like more. They have more time to look for a career with the charateristics they like. Students have more time to save money. They can know other careers where they can get a good pay. Teachers can help students to get a good career base in their Knowledge.

In conclusion students should commit a career at a young age bacause as I said helps the students to preparate. The time is one of the best reason that help them. The knowledge from other people help the students what is better. Students dont get pressure also they have more oppurtunities. Students should commit a career at a young age because is one of the best choice they can do.                                          "
2054,9AC838864995,"Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together.

So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day.

If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done.

If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays.

I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly.

109,0803CE11A14A,"I think that I would chose to be a nurse for the school to make sure that students will be safe in and out of school. I want It to be somewhere that students can come and talk to me whats wrong. I think that if I get this job I will take It and learn from it ,so I would like to see the manger to see if he approves of It.

I would also want to go to a good collage to get the education to be a nurse. It is going to be hard to get this job ,but I am going to work for it as hard as I can. I also have to put in a lot of effort into this job to get it. It would at least take me about four years to be in a collage to help me study about how to be a nurse. Being a nurse will be difficult in a many ways, but it's a matter of learning of how to do something. I would say its a better idea if I study longer it would be a most likely that I would get the job.

More ways to be a nurse is by being organized because you need to know what the students need to become a nurse. Also I would need to listen to directions because you can mess up because it's an important job. There are a lot of pros and cons about being a nurse because it's a job where you can mess up you can get into serious trouble. It takes a lot of time to be things that you want to be ,but everything takes times ,so I would say being something that you enjoy and think if you can do it. I would definitely want to be a nurse in a school to prove to the manager that I can do it.

Hopefully the manager can take this into conservation if I could get this job. I would show to make schools better by having a fantastic nurse taking care of students when they aren't feeling well at school. I would like all students to feel safe to have a nurse that is there to help them when they aren't feeling great at school. I hope I can be a great nurse ,and so I can get the job to become someone great in there school. Thank you and I hope I can the job."
999,4CB5C9A9AD5A,"I am not agree with this, because the school hours star at 7 am and end to 2:10 pm, in that time we can work after school, and do other important things that we have in the day, but if the school adopted this rule, the days for the students are gone ,because if the school take that rule , the students are going home from the school at 4 pm, and they are arrive home at 5 pm ,so they don't going to have time for do others things, like work or do the homework ,because they just go home to sleep and do some things that the students have to do in home for help in the house.

But for the work weeks are better because they are going to have more time or one more day for have fun with their family and they don't have any problems because they just have to stay two more hour and they going to have one more day off and that is better for they, because is like that they are working that day ,and they get the same pay and the workers just go to work and then go home.

Except for some students are different because they have to go to the school and they have to get up early ,and after school they have to go at work, that is difficult for some students, because they go in to the work after school like at 2:30 , and go out like at 12:00 am, and they don't sleep nothing the rest of the night, and they come tired to the school but they still come to the school, and they do the work that they have to do in the school, and the home too, so that is why that going to affect the students.

I don't think that this new rule going to benefit the students, that rule just benefit the workers, because they going to have one more day left, and to more hours of work in the day, but for the students they get up early and go out of the school late ,and that is bad because, we don't going to have more time for work, just for study and do home work and sleep, that is all the things that we going to do, if the school adopted that rule the day for students are going to be gone for them.

That is what i think about that prompt."
2398,B23BDDB4B5FA,"Community Service??

Dear principle,

I would like to help in the community service group. I think it is very important for us as student's to help in the community service. It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that that's why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash can's when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i don't think another person would pick it up but they should. We don't want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. That's why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others don't want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community. Well this is what i think dear principle and i hope you like my letter!!!

Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for education purpose. Many people say cellphones is a great tool for specific things, such as something you may want to know or something you do not know. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you.

The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones. For example, cellphones it may help you to look for something you might want to know, but when the test and quizzes comes students are not going to know anything because students did not pay attention for being in their cellphones the hall day doing nothing.

Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun. For example some students likes to take photos of someone just for have fun or just for bully them in their social media.

Some people say cellphones is a tool to do homework, project, or something you want to do in your cellphone, or when you are confused with something, however cellphones distract you to do those kind of stuff, such as being at your apps and not doing what you suppose to be doing while because you are texting or face timing someone and you get distract and you forgot about to finish your homework or classwork that the teacher have signed you to do,and your grades might go down into a zero if your keep distracting yourself being in you phone during class time.

In conclusion some schools use cell phones in their classroom for educational purpose. Cellphones should not be allow during classroom for educational purposes because students would not learn anything if they are in theirs cellphones during classroom , we know that every student love being in their cellphone during the day, but cellphones will not help student in their educational purposes, and cellphones are not gonna help you learn what you need to learn during students school education.

2198,A3E6A572C6E5,"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they don't understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture.

Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you don't even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Name's family didn't understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesn't want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. That's why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not.

dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didn't let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up.

""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In today's world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and that's where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you.

Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Name's mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers'. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Name's mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and that's that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you don't have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didn't want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back.

In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.

2101,9DDBBA28EBD0,"I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.

One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out.

Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasen't getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.

Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasen't good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.

And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.

In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve."
1473,71F27422C5FC,"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.

To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.

To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.

Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.

And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.

In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the ""Success Gate"" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next America's generations."
1328,65CC82C9B3C9,"I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.

Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.

People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.

In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done."
3346,E7A370A15B49,"Yes agree with it, because if you fail one time you will try to do it in a different way, but you never have to loss your enthusiasm if you have a goal you need try to to get it otherways you will never make it always try to do your best never let anybody tell you what to do anything can be possible.

when i was young i wanted to be good at soccer but when i play with my cousings they allways make fun of me, and i stare crying i never try to be good a soceer never. then i was always staying after to play with peolpe at my age, I was getting better and better at soccer, and after like one year after i went to my aunt house my cousings told me to play with then, they were surprise because better then they.

When i first came to USA all my family was tellimg to learn english. First when i was learning a little be of english, and my teacher told me to practice english in the class (talk to others students in class), but i was scare that the student make fun of me, so that day i did not spoke english in class i told my self ( i going to learn and make my self proud)

at the end of the school year my english was better i was always epeaking english with my sister and to my teachers too.

Others people think taht if you can""t do something you have to stop doing it or stop trying, others will told you that you can""t do it, but remember you can do everything you propouse .

So if you want to do something just do it don't be afraid of failing doesn't matter if you fail you can keep trying to do it make your family proud meke your self proud. Life is beautiful try to get your goals done. And remember you can do anything you want just if you try really hard. At the end you will remember all of the people who told you that you will fail, and the people that always believe on you."
9,009F4E9310CB,"Asking more than one person for and advice help you take a strong choice? seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Example presidential election,requires someone opinion and choosing a restaurant to eat at and place to visit. Theres good and bad opinion but pick one or two or more but choose one the help you make a great decision.

First many us citizen are required to vote. Many of them would have different opinion about who is the best candidates. Positive and negative opinions would be circulating about the candidates but you can ask more than person what they think about the candidates there be interesting opinion and some not so interesting think about what the many opinion you hear and think about the one the got you thinking the most.

on the other hand lots of people love going out to eat. Many people try new places to eat at some may hear good or bad opinion about a place but until you try it you can't tell your self is great or bad. Sometimes Google lets you see other people opinion the other people leaved about a certain place. to be honest my dad does this sometimes he goes online and search is up the place and then looks at the rate the place have and the comment as a result of the deadly corovirus (Covid-19) lots of people have decide not to travel. But theres certain people that just love to travel many of the occasion people travel to a place because they hear good thing about a place. for example thats how me and my family hear of Lego land my aunt tell my dad that this place was so amazing me and my family we have been a big fan o Lego and we really dint know this place existed.

finally sometimes people have positive and negative opinion about something or someone but is you job to find out the one the makes you fell like ""this is the one"" many people there own believed thats why you may hear different opinion. Have you ever ask for more than one opinions? i actually have that was went i was't sure which suit to put in a red or black suit so ask my mom dad ans sister they tell me the best suit was the black one.

2842,CEC5B40D1688,"The technology that humans have developed is very advance; a lot of time has been dedicated to it, so society can have a better and easier way to access to technology. However, as all things that are crated by man are not perfect, and it has its positive and negative impacts on people. A lot of those impacts that technology have are negative impacts. For example, you loose the opportunity of interacting with other people, you can get addicted to technology, and you can get lazy, and all these negative impacts affect the new generation the most. The little kids end up playing video games their entire childhood; instead of playing outside, and making new friends.

First, technology it is not just to have fun with; you can play video games, but keep in mind that if you abuse of the use of technology you are going to get addicted in a very short period of time. Spending all your time in technology have its consequences. You loose the opportunity to be in contact with the people around you, you can loose your friends if you had any, and most important you can loose your communication that you once had with your parents. You can have hundreds of friends on social media, but it is not worth it if you do not spend time with them. Also one of the most negative impact is that little kids are getting addicted to technology. They are spending most of their childhood playing video games, and doing things that are not going to do any good for them in the future. They should be playing outside with their friends, and enjoying their childhood which is one of the most beautiful things they have. When you are a little kid you are so innocent that you do not have to worry about any problems the adults may have, and you do not have any problems to worry about either. Unfortunately that childhood have to end at some point because nothing last forever, but in the meantime you just have to live your childhood and not worry about any video games.

Second, you can use the internet for any need you may have, for there are hundreds of websites of anything you would like use. For example, shopping online, checking out book, and get any information you want. Some other websites are not quite useful like scams, or some websites that contains virus. At some point you may or may not run into a scam website which are used to obtain personal information that you have put online. They can get that credit card information that you used for your online shopping, your social security number, or even your own bank account number. There are people that work on trying to protect your personal information; they use their knowledge for the good of society, but there are also people who uses their skills and try to get your personal information, and use it for their own benefit. Keep in mind that those people can be smarter than you, and they can take every single dollar that you have in your bank account if you put your information at risk.

Third, you become lazier when you can get any information you want without making a big effort because you have everything at the reach of your hand by having access to the internet. You got so used to getting things fast and without making an effort, and when you have to wait to get any kind of information you get frustrated, for the fact that you have to go through a whole book, so you can that information. Man have been making your life easier by creating all the technological advances you have now. For example, you do not have to make an effort to wash your clothes, or wash the dishes you have been given all of that, so you have became lazier.

At the end technology can result positive impact to society; it has made our life easier, but it has resulted in a negative impact for the new generations. It has made the youth lazier than it was in the old times; teenagers are now addicted to social media, and we are loosing the communication with our parents which is very important to have. Little kids are loosing their childhood in result of the new technological advances that allows them to be playing video games and not going outside to make friends. Technology has put the security of our information at risk by no protecting it enough. Maybe it is the way we use technology, but it has more negative impact than positive impact to our communities around the world.                              "
3074,DA994B5C3784,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. That's why I believe that people should always try to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. It's always good to talk to someone in case of an emergency. For example I was sick at home with a lot of pain and I refused to go to the hospital, until I talked to a doctor about how I was feeling and he suggested that I go to the hospital to get checked up and I did and it made me feel a lot better. Sometimes it's good to take an experts advice in a matter like I was in, you don't always have to take their advice but its good to just talk to someone about it and keep in mind what they say for future references. It's always good to follow your own instincts but sometimes it's not. Their are people who have experienced the same thing you might be going through right now and are certified or trained to help. For example my aunt is currently training to be a consular for high school kids and her goal is to gain the trust of her students so they can come to her when they need help. She always tells me that she was a high school kid at a point and she knows what its like and the problems kids might be going through, so that's why shes training to help them in making the right decisions. When I need help making a life decision about something like college I go to my consular who's been in college and knows what could be right for me, I always take in mind what they advice me and make a decision. It doesn't always necessarily need to be help for an adult it can always be help from a sibling or other family member who has been through what you have and who you know will lead you in the right direction. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. "
2470,B7AABB24BDB8,"Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng.

There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it.

Let's take an example of two students. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. Now all of us what the result gonna come. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time.

So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doen't mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he can't run having faith in himself that he can do it. From rabbit side we shouldn't do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible.

In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. Time is the most important key factor in our life. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task."
1283,6253F73FBABF,"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.

If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.

In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.

be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.

Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.

Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are.

being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you.

could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

""BE SOMEONE BEYOND OF OTHERS CUZ YOU GOT IT"""
2486,B8EE6B6594BD,"Most students enjoy summer vacations,but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and the students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year rounds schools,where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring fall.

This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations ,because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same .The system to the long long vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adultlife and need time off for live.

The idea that the students's vacations need are more short is bad because the students in high school needs long period of vacation for find their firts job, some students need travel to other country for visit their family and need a long vacations; if the students not have a good long vacations they can stressed and have other nervous problems.

For this situation to improve that the vacation are very short is impossible because not all students have a same system to live and some need time to find independitzation, some enjoy with their family and other can study in their homes, in other words the students need explore the world and this only can possible when have time in vacations the rest of the year they can study.

Educators and other people that think the system of short vacations need understand that before they was a students and they also was need vacation for forget all thing and enjoy the life.

The other side for take postion in this issue is that the short bacations are goof for not forget the learned in old classes.

Some people think that the student need a long periods of vacation specifically in summer , but this is bad because the student only need study and the student cannot retain the information for long time and they need more time in the school for learn more thing and repeat the learned in past years."
3441,EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arn't in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student?

The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosen't feel like doing it. Students who don't do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arn't distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isn't.

Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they don't get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isn't capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial?

Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers.

Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesn't matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.     "

Technology should do not use allows people to complete because not the all time use that tradition, However; technology should use allows people to complete is better for a job. Technology should use allows people to complete many task because the people can use the technology for investigate something important, the people use the technology for work, and the people can use the technology for distract to other things.

Technology should use allows people to complete many tasks because the people can use the technology to investigate something important. For example when we have a doubt we have to find evidence for real and we have to know if it is true. Also maybe we have a homework about the old time we have to use the internet. Also too if we have a question about something old or something like that we have to investigate, so we have to use the technology. Technology should use allows people to complete many tasks because the people can use the technology for investigate something important.

Technology should use allows people to complete many tasks because the people use the technology for work. For example somebody work on a office and then have a project to do then have to use the technology. Also have a doubt about a unknown enterprise and have to know about that then have to find that information in the internet. Also too if work about computer's or something like that they have to use the technology. Technology should use allows people to complete many tasks because the people use the technology for work.

1493,7333B4549006,"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.

Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.

Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.

In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.

At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.

They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. "
2312,AC6348A7ECB4,"SOME SCHOOLS OFFER DISTANCE LEARNING AS AN OPTION FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND

CLASSES FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO YOU THINK

STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES FROM HOME:

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Parents do not want their children to attend classes from home. Students will not get much benefits, whoever if they live in a place that is far away from school or they can't attend school for any reason then its has benefits. I'm not agree that students should attend classes from home because students can have stress, students can not pay attention very well, and the most important fact is that it will affect on students' grades.

The first reason is that the students can get stressed everyone time whenever they attend the class online because i know that its not easy to take classes online. students have to pay more attention. They can not understand very well by online or on video conference. It will be hard for students to learn or to understand their lesson online. Students will be stressed out because no one will be there to help them, not any teacher and either any friend (any other student).

The second reason why students should not take classes at home is that they will not able to pay attention by taking online classes. it does not feel like the school environment. students will spent more time on their school. At least in schools we pay more attention than doing our homework at home, because we mostly spend our time on our devices (cell phone) and on the television by watching episodes, cartoon movies, other movies, and etc.

The third reason is that it also affect on students grades and in the future they can not attend their favorite college. They won't able to understand the lesson, they will get bad grades in all subjects. It is so important to attend the classes at school, then you will know what is going on. students can ask teachers if they are having problems in their lesson. teachers can help them during school timing or after school. It will be easy for students to understand or to pay attention and they can get good grades too in all their subjects.

Students should not take classes at home. It will affect on their grades because they will not able to pay attention, they will get stressed out because if student need help, no one will be there to help them for their studies or their lessons, and it will be hard to pay attention at house by doing online studies.

235,113436EC45E2,"The philosopher Albert Schweitzer thought the example is not important and is not the main thing to influencing others, it is the only thing. Now the society thing different around the world many persons like the parents thing they need to give a good example their sons. the teacher need to be good example from their students at the school. Famous people like their fans sometimes they are under 12 ages. if the persons did not given to the new generation good example they can not be influencing good things in them.

The parents they are the best example for their sons, and daughter at home. Because at home sometimes is the first school for our child that can has, there we learn speak, walk, and who clothing you. Example: if her father is a drunk, and smoker what is a example him given to his sons. That would by influencing in her sons and can destroy the future of them. This situation happen in many family and children start to have problem with the authority. And is the bad example that their parents given to them . And is no only the things the parents give to her sons nevertheless they need more then a example, more then things like expensive clothes. and shoe many of them they need a parents that care of them.

The teacher after the father they are so important to give a example of respect, how can be responsible with our homework they challenge us , with no matter the obstacle is front of us we can do it many of the teacher support you in the situation of the school but they teach us who can we do our work when be adults and they start to explain many thinks that you dont know example: if you do something wrong they help us to find a situation like i math and they do not say bad thinks when you do something wrong because they respect you but we like a students need to do it too. And with this attitude is like a teacher can influencing in a student with the respect.

Leader is person that is caretaker of a group of people it is in the school, in a church in many places we can find one. This one example of who can be influences of a movement like in the church that person need to be example of his people than the people follow him or she. Example: always a leader need to support the people no the people to him. Because the leader teach them how can be a good leader and him give example of that like a good person,good attitude, friendly. etc. And with his example this is the person can influence the other person without things and inspire more person that one day them teach another

In conclusion, to be a examples is the main thing to be a influence in the world and any areas. i desaggres because i think for influence to another persons. So your must be the best example you can because one they more then one person will fallow your steps. Like on my neighborhood or community helped who needed one day on person can do the same thing for anothers.           "
1180,5B40AA0E6C2B,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude of the people. I think is very important to be positive and has a good attitude with everybody.

In the other head, many people likes the people that has a positive attitude. For example when I was in my country Generic_City. There is a woman call Generic_Name she have a small restaurant in the park front to her house . She was sell I say was because I don't know if she still has the restaurant. However In the restaurant she was sell many type of food. For example soup, chicken, pupusas and Generic_Name need someone to help her with the restaurant job. And there is a woman her name is Generic_Name she is very smart however she has a bad attitude with every body.

She went to apply for the restaurant job and she has a good experience in the restaurant. And there is other woman name Generic_Name she is very nice and she always try to help others in the community also she has a positive attitude with the people. Generic_Name call Generic_Name and Generic_Name Because Generic_Name want to interview. Also she want meet they and see how they are and what they know about work in a restaurant.

The fist woman the come to Generic_Name house was Generic_Name she don't say good morning she just went to Generic_Name and say I am interesting in the job.

Generic_Name was very surprising because her just ask for the job don""t in troduce herself and Generic_Name told her that she already has someone to help her in the restaurant. Generic_Name just say ok bye. After one hour Generic_Name come to Generic_Name House and she say good Morning I am Generic_Name it is here where they are hearing someone to help work in a restaurant.

Generic_Name told her yes so Generic_Name was talking with Generic_Name and Generic_Name know that Generic_Name know a little about work in a restaurant bout she notice that she is smart and with the time she well be learn fast and she well be appreciate the opportunity that Generic_Name is give to her. Also Generic_Name has a positive attitude went she was speaking with Generic_Name.

In fact I think has a positive attitude is the key to success in life. For example, few days ago my father was very worry because he has just two days to finish one of the big job the he has. He was thinking to ask my brother if he has time to came help him. My brother told him that he is going to help him and he look at my father he was very worry and he ask my father what is happen why he look worry.

my father told him that is for the job that he has he just has two days to finish and my brother always has a positive attitude and he told my father to don't worry that everything is going to be okay. And he is going to do his best to help him with the job. He is going to do the more fast that he can and he is going to ask his friends to came and help hem with his big project. After two days they finish the job on time. And My father boss was so happy that they do a great job and my father was very proud of my brother because he has a positive attitude and he believe in his self.

This is why I think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Because is help to win many things with the family and other persons."
2142,A0129E84B1D4,"First of all, the technology is really usefull and i think that it will have a posiitive effect in people's lives, the cuestion is how?. For example, people will not have to take a bus to visit other people, or walk miles to see other folks, instead they can just call in their phones and have a little chit chat by using tecnology.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else. In the mean time you can use your phone and unload an app to shop somthing that you like, there are several things like clothes, shoes, food, tools, and other things that can be usefull for you or you child, whatever, and there is also the app for books; people don't have to take a lot of time loking for a book, they can just find it by put it in the device or the computter

Third, some benefits of the technology is the time that you spent looking for sonthing or deciding, another benfit is the things that you can learn with all the information that is in the web, ofcourse if you use it properly like it is. You can learn how to be an artist, how to cook, and how to fix something broken.

In addition, sometimes people get addicted in a web and that could be bad, that is when the negative effecs came, people don't know what they are doing when they get adicted to it, that is why people have to know how to use it correctly

Consecuently, the technology is developing more and more, we can built great things for the future and create more, eventually, the tecnology is not the only one that is developing, there is the science too because it help to develop other things and bring protection to people.

In conclution, the technology can bring positive effects to people because is a sounce of knowledge that you can use to inprove people's live."

I agree with Ralph Waldo statement because, you won't realize your mistakes. For example if you only succeed in life you won't know what to do if you fail or how to fix them. There for you'll achieve and have more success by failing. This helps because you'll actaully know the struggle people would put themself to accomplish their goal. Also knowing you have fail you'll know what is expected in order the success.

I disagree with Ralph Waldo statement because you won't accomplish as much goals. For example you won't know what to do if you ever do fail. i mean is good that your sucessing in life but just wait until the unexpected comes thats whe all the boom lets lose. i fact success isn't as bad is actually good.

In my opinion i would say success isn't as better as failure. They are both a team. While i agree this is why i pick Ralph statement is cause the un expected always comes in lfe.  "

In some of the foods there is so much oil, that is not healthy instead it can make us sick. The more healthier students are the more productive they will be. They will feel like they are more energetic and want to run around, that means they will want to try out for sports. Some of lunch food now makes students really lazy because of all that oil, that means they just want to sleep and not do anything at all. The healthier food will help out many kids with health issues. The students need to be healthier young, for the future they don't have any health issues. The healthier food can help students with their body, less fat and motivates them to be someone they thought they couldn't be. The more healthier students are, the less sick they are. Students are more present in school. Students need some of the vitamins from the healthy food. There are so many good benefits of having a healthy lunch, not only for health issues but make students feel really good about themselves.

When school is over and student try to gets started on their homework, but they don't understand the work and their'er no teacher there to help them with the homework. Beginning an after school program can help student gets their homework done fast, learn more thing, and also having more free time.

First, every one need to do their homework from the teacher. Some teacher give out homework to help the student remember thing that the student learn that day in their head. Doing dome work can also help student keep up the grade.

Next, learning more thing can also help you during school day, it can also get you ready for a test or a pop quiz at any time so you don't have to stay up late to study or wake up early int he morning to review. You can also get ahead of your friend in your class.

Last, every one need some free time after school,but you cant because on the homework that the teacher give you. Going to an after school program can help you finish your homework fast and also give you free time at home to take care of your little brother or sister.

53,046C6FB91CBA,"Distance learning can be very helpful to students who cannot attend classes at school like other students. Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes.

Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down.

Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library.

In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.

791,3D8CF58944E1,"I think schools shouldn't add one and a half hours more to schools because kids need time to rest there brains, have enough time to make it on time to there after school activities, and students need more time to finish up their homework and studying.

First, kids need time to rest there brains by going outside, and watching on the TV for a little.

If schools add more time, then students will not have any time to have fun which causes them to not have much time to sleep, less time to sleep effects their school day. An example of that is if I had extra time to my school then I would have had no time to play, take a nap, or watch youtube. That causes me to not have enough sleep time. This type of rule is not healthy for the students.

Second, kids need time to make it to there after school activities. after school activities are usually straight after school, but if students add more time to school then kids will not make it to his or her after school activity. An example is if a student had to go to football practice everyday at 4:00, then students would not make it if school ended at 4:15. without physical education and only just education by sitting in a chair just writing and reading is not healthy for your body. that's why students need more time for there after school activities. this is also bad because it effects your sleep time also which makes you tired for school the next day.

Last, students will not have enough time to finish up there homework from all the time from school and other stuff they have to do at home. For an example is if there was a test the next day, and I havn't studied so I had to study, I wouldn't have had enough time to study because the extra time in school or if I had to do an after school activity. This is not good for students to add time to school so they do not have enough time to study or finish homework because they will not get a good grade on the test or quiz and especially get a bad grade in the class.

Back to the thesis, they should not add an hour and a half of school because it will effect our brain, body, and grades. It will affect it by being late or not showing up to his or her after school activity, less time for the kids brain to rest, and not having time to finish homework or to study.

Why would people want to add time to school?"
3541,F0B44890C961,"Dear Sir or Madam:

Yes school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities, If they're doing terribly in school. If a student is doing terrible in school and he is in so many extracurricular activities, The School should take action right away. If the student has no time to study and involved in so many activities the student is defenitely going trough something. For example: The student's familymight be going trough rough times and he does not want to come home early, and Also he might be avoiding someone at home.

Second reason School's should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. because the Student has no time to study and the student is in so many school activities that is going to result to a bad grade. If the student has bad grades the Student is going to be stress about school and The student might ended up dropping out of school. If the student drop out of highschool it is not going to be easy for him to find a good paying job.

That is the reason why school's should take control of students involvement in extracurricular activities. If they do take control of the students with bad grades the it's in a club. They should be taken out of the club and help the student to get his grades up, and if he does he he get to join the club. Every students should earn it by having good grades.

1423,6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.

First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.

Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.

Lastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.

I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.

In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

some day of this week my friend bring a pants and i'm saw him, my fist empression was ''naa this not going which you , so i will honest with him , if somebody tell me something that is not pleasing for me i'm sure that i going to put my impression face , and maybe the other person don't like, but it's impossible to change my impression , I will direct which the people ,if the people don`t like my impression i'm sorry for them, yeah maybe it's not correct to say the fist impression , i'm agree for that too, and i understand that some people put angry when i do that , but i can't change my actituded because i'm like this, it's the same with the another people they got them own impression but in different ways , that's fot that i'm agree , and i understand that is so important to me beacuse i don't know if the other person feel bad when i say the first impression , that's why i need to improve my impression , some people and my friends are annoying with me for this , and that's why i need to practice respect to myself and the another people.

The fist impression is bad idea because if i'm in the job and my boss tell me that my work is not like this, and i say my fist impression that's sure that my boss will put annying because maybe he try to teach me, and the fist thing that i do is my impression and is not a good imprression,

some impression are good because when somegirl look beautiful my impression going to be wow i like how they look today , so impression can be good or bad,

the impression can used in different ways, can use in possitive and negative forms so we decide what kind of impression to used , but a lot a time we only used a negative impression in that is not correct , for example if i or some friend bring something or do something we need to do an possitive impression but we always give a negative impression and that is not correct we need to encourage this person but we only do negative things.

Having a godd impression we are more than we can imagene because everybady respect to you and nobody got problem with you , and thats a opportunities to alot of ways in your life .

The imagination is a fundamental function to every aspect of daily life. Could be job,family,school etc, every time the human is using his imagination to think about the steps it needs to perform activities, and the knowledge and skills it will use to complete a specific task. The imagination is a very important skill for life that the human uses for evolve, therefore the imagination is the reason why the humans had evolving for years and it has adopted to different circumstances of the daily life.

The imagination is always the first step of everything ideas,tasks,decisions everything, the imagination will always be the first model of every idea. To give a image every time when the human creates a object to complete a respective task is using his imagination to think about what people needs and how that object will complete the specific task to help somebody. Every idea it comes from the imagination, and then the human perform his skills and knowledge to create the idea.

Without the imagination the human will not have knowledge. The base of the knowledge is the imagination, the the imagination is the ability to the think the knowledge is all the different ideas that we think to perform any activity that the human want to perform. To give a image it will be useless if a human has skills in math,science,

3763,F9FEE5DC1640,"Imagination and knowledge are all come from you mine, but what are the different between those two? Scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I'm agree with him, because if you take a class like art or computer graphs, you don't really need your knowledge, the most important thing you need, is your imagination. It can help you do better in the class.

first, the different between Imagination and knowledge is you don't need to rember the knowledge, and sometimes people have hard time to remberm. So you just need to think you like to do, and you don't need to follow the knowledge what you learn. I'm that kind of person that don't like to rember things, but I like to do what in my mine want to do. We have a lot knowledge need to learn, and we never finished learning, but we can use our imagination to do more things that is helpful to the world.

I guess, everybody like to play video games, but do you know how they make the games up? I did create app club this fall, first I thought we will create some app what other people already create it before, but than the teacher told us that, everybody will be create in they are own app, I don't know what kind of app I want to create, and told the teacher said, ""can I create a one somebody just create it before?"" ""No, you can't, you need to be imagination, just think of what you want to do, and what kind of app you like."" She answer. the end of the due day, I use my imagination to create a game app. From this class I learn that imagination is more important than knowledge.

Imagination and knowledge are both important, but imagination is a little better than knowledge, we can use our imagination to do more helpful things to our beautiful world. In our life we have too much knowledge need to learn, we need to keep learning and nerve stop.  "
2857,CF7AF5FA5DDC,"Some people say that having a positive attitude is one of the keys to success in life. Everyone around the world is trying to be successful in life, people fight for that everyday. A positive attitude is really important when you are trying to be successful, is sometimes what motivates you to keep going and achieve your goals.

However, just having a positive attitude is not going to make you a successful person. To reach the success in life you need to be proactive, you need to believe in yourself, work as hard as you can, and do what you love because your soul and hearth is what guide you during your life.

When you look at the big Hollywood stars, or the players in the NFL, you can see that they successes in life, making millions of dollars and doing what they love. Believe or not, but they gave everything they had to be there. It was a mix of positive attitude, hard work, and talent.

In conclusion, a positive attitude is the key success in life, but only who's really trying and giving their hearth into this, will be successful."
3122,DCBE020F2A4F,I agree honesty is the best policy but sometimes honesty is bad beacuse you can hurt people feeling and people dont fell the same with you when your hones with them. Also someone that like when people are honesty with them they wont care because it good to be honesty with them beacuse what if there doing something bad that you dont like and your hones with them and you tell to fix that thing that where doing that you dont like. Another thing if you get in trouble in school be hones with your teacher and tell them what happened be hones dont ever lie to your teacher. Then if your in a relationship with some and you dont like them anymore dont be shy then the true be hones. finally if you go to a store and you tell something from the store and they tell you are you stealing something tell them the true beacuse if you leave with out paying you can get in trouble with the police that why be hones with some ask you if your stealing something tell them then true be hones. That why i agree with honesty.
454,223FCA37F79D,"We should allow the students to bring there cell phones while they are at school, but as the school rules say ""the cell phones should be off or on silent during class. The students may take out there phones when they are at lunch or when they have free time. If the students do not follow these rules they will get consequences for having there cell phones on during class or using them during class. And if the students are using there cell phones during class it may distract other students while they are learning. These students are responsible for there cell phones going on in class or even using them during class. If a teacher is seeing any of there students using a phone the teacher will either take the phone away or he or she will tell the student to put it away because it is distracting the other students from learning. And it will mot just distract the other students, but it distracts the student that has the phone. If the student is not paying attention it could bring down there grade and they will not be learning anything what there teacher is showing them. if they get to distracted with the cell phone they can be in danger at school. they will not be able to do any school sports when they have really bad grades. If they were to leave there cell phones alone and start to learn maybe they could start playing sports. they will also bring up there grade as well.

1450,6F3C318ED62E,"Of course that i'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me "" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm"".

I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!.

The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example:

In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time.

For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm.

In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you.

In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it.

In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't.

Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want.

In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: "" Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent "", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm."
122,0943E322C195,"To me its more beneficial working as a group. I have a few reasons why its better working with a group rather then working alone you can learn from one another also be motivated to learn as a group. Making new friends can be tough but when you are but in a group you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is having disscustions with the group. There are many reasons why i prefer working with a group and im hear to share with you.

Working with a group is all about sharing new ideas and discovery with your group that some people didn't know about. With a group everyone would get good grades and ace their exams. Some people in your group may have the same intrest as you and would like to study that objective more and being motivated by one another.

In my opinion working with a group is more simpler and fun at the same time and kids will enojy learning that way.

One small little problem about working with a group is having disscustions about the subject that the group is talking about. They with all disagreements but also argree with each other . The group tends to get mad maybe because someone in the group said something the other didn't like and would have a argument. There are more pros then cons in working with a group for sure .

Everyone has a different saying if its beneficial to either work with a group or work alone .

I'm not at all saying working alone is a bad thing on the contrarie its also good because sometimes you might not get along with the group you got asand with and you just wanna do your work alone. Working in a group though brings you toghter as a school and theres nothing better then working in a team."
3322,E6122E9ABFA3,"Are first impression almost impossible to change? Most people would say no, but actually it is possible. You just need willingness, hard work, and a litle of confidence.

First of all, if you want to change any first impression, you have to will it. You need to have a vision of how you want to change it. Most people try to change their first impression, but the thing is they don't have a vision. Without a vision you are going nowhere, you most have a vision. Lots of people give up but I know you can do it, because failure is not an option. Always remember will is power.

Second of all, willing something is just the first part to change our first impression. The hard work is probably the most complicated, becasue is where you gonna find some challenges. Challenges are part of life, so don't see them as impossibles, but see them as oportunities. You have to work hard to reach your goal, no matter what. Keep this in mind life is not fair, so you better keep doing and don't look back of what have you done. Always have a clear vision og what you do.

Finally, this is probably the most importamt part, confidence. Confidence plays a big roll to change our fisrt impresion. If your not a cofident person, it migth be hard for you to change but not impossible. You can take classes to gain cofidence like me which is helpful. I'm not cofident person but took the JROTC class which has help me to be more confident amd not olny that, I have learned to be a leardership too. If I can do it, that mean you can. Don't let anything to stop you.

Inconclusion, think about your future is very important. Changeing your fist impression is a good start. You never know if that will affect your future. Just will it, work har for it, and be confident.        "
3642,F530741D2297,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson's quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. Everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone.

For starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. This proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education.

Second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. We can only accomplish a lot by doing everything in our power to make better this world a better place.

In Jefferson's quote, he was saying that we can do so much by doing something and it is true. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see."
2680,C616874461F9,"Is the most benefit to work alone because the students learn more, for example: if they work in group they need to divide all the work in always can't all the students learnd all the work because a student do one part of the work and other student also do the other part, but if a student work alone he can learn all the work because he do all the work alone and he know about al work.

Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all student do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student don't undertand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the mayority of the students prefer to work in group because is more easy and sometimes a student don't work and all the rest of the group do all the work.

But in my opinion I prefer to work alone because I learn more and understand more about any type for example if work alone I need to do all the work and I need to found all the information and do all the examples and explain all about my work, the most important about this two type is learn to working in group and workin alone because sometimes in the future all will work in group or alone,

in both form is good to work and always do the best and each work.

Both have benefits but I think that the best option is to work alone also because is better for the student start to work alone, for the teachers the best option is the same, the students work alone because in this form they can learn more about the student in how they work and how they think, the teachers can see the capacity of each student because not all the students work the same in this process help to all the teachers learn more about all students."
1950,93385DED39E7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school."
2521,BB430219DBB4,"In my opinion it's not a good idea because in every country in world it's role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they don't like school the only reason they don't like the school is that they wake up early and they can't sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. it's good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance.

In the other country's the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years.

Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that it's not good to graduate early because you didn't learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they can't answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he did'nt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity.

Working in school time is not good for student, because he can't learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he did'nt study he can't graduate. it's rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 it's not to work his family have to support him to study. It's family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosen't have to study too much because collage is easy that school.

I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didn't study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.    "
529,28639BE05BB7,"Music, drama, art class are considered as an elective class. Since such class will never be use in a daily basis in life. It's not required for you in order to graduate so to speak there is many more choices rather than music, drama, and art class to replace with it. It shouldn't be a required class for the student to take since everyone has a different mindset of what they want to be.

Something we use in our life that we learn from school is basic math to do our taxes and bills, but when will you ever use music, drama, or art in life, It's more like a hobby rather than a need in order to maintain a stable life. People don't care if you know how to write a song, act melodramatic, and how to draw Mona Lisa, applying for a job with such thing in your portfolio won't get you employed in most places. If you major in such things, only those of who are talented and skilled will only be able to have a successful life in such class. Electives are there for a reason, to have a starting point of what you want to be in the future, if it was turned to a required class, the world would have a second renaissance.

You don't need it in order to graduate. College wouldn't look into those as much as the prerequisite to your diploma or the major subject. Knowing how to paint or sculpt clay wouldn't be at the SAT that college look into if your'e eligible of going to their school or if they want you. As people grow up and go to college, their goals will change eventually. For example, you grow up and you want to be a doctor and half way through your college year you want to be a Scientist instead. You've covered some similar classes or lessons already since they are both major in science, but such classes like music, drama, or art class doesn't have any similarity when you changed your goal. They are a specific to themselves, they don't have a wide broad of category that shares with other subjects at all.

Learning and able to make music, be dramatic, and draw art might be a useful thing. Write songs for famous artist, act on plays and movies and even be recognize for your work in arts and make a lot of money from it. Only if you are successful, whether you are born with a talent or obsessed in such things and have one goal from the start. Only those of few will able to make a living out of it. It's not reliable career to as much as to be a requirement in school to be.

Only to be fixated in such subjects gives you less option of what you want to be,

it's not as needed in reality so that is why classes such as music, drama, and art be an elective. Students should not be required to take those classes since they will not have as much choice in what they want to be in their life.    "

1184,5C017EF0CF1E,"It's important to talk to a guidance and authorities expert when making a decision. People may say that making your own decision is good but others, say seeking guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters is better, because it's helpful to hear other people's advice and they are experienced.

some people may argue that making your own decision is good because it make's a operson independent and people don't have to hear other people's opinion. They have a point but how do they know they are making the right choice if they don't try talking to a guidance expert.

Seeking guidance form experts and authorities about life's important matters is important because it's helpful to hear other people's advice. For example if my friend Generic_Name had to make a life changing decision it's important that she goes and talks to a guidance counselor. Also if she doesn't speak to a guidance expert and she makes a wrong choice who knows what could happen. It also makes room for less mistakes when you talk to others who are experts in guiding people. It's good to talk to a guidance counselor to make sure the decision being mabe is benefiting the person in a positive way. It's important to seek for guidance when making a decision.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters is better because they are experienced. If people were to talk to others who don't have any idea what they are talking about, than that might not be helpful for the person who needs help. Also it makes it easy to trust someone who is experienced. which means the person who needs help would be less stress out when having to make the decision. When speaking to someone who is experienced it makes it easy for people to talk to with out having to worry if the person is going to say the wrong thing. Speaking to a guidance and authorities who is experienced is important when making a decision.

In conclusion when making an important decision its important to talk to a guidance and authorities expert, to reassure what the person is doing is right for them, So that the decision they make does not affect the person in a negative way. It also helps the person grow and it shows them when making choices they don't have to go through it alone.      "
711,36A74F4F050A,"Do we pick our own character traits? Can it be pick by the type of influences that is beyound our control? if so then What kind of traits would we have? How are the trailts we choice is the right traits for us?

Most people say the type of traits a person can have define who are as a person, and saying that is ture because the kind of trait you would have or choices can define your character. like for instances let's say you are a very working person your so dedicated to your work that is a trait of dedication or when a person is so nice to you that shows kindness another trait. Even mabybe a person who likes to read that would be a bookworm this is also a trait. Everybody has a trait that they choose.

We choose our owns traits because we think or we know that's the kind of traits we want to have. I am a person who loves to read books, loves food, kind to others, and who can be lazy at most time. A guy name John Lubbock Said "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I'm choosing these traits to be myself and myself only.

The kind of traits i have is kindness, lazyness, bookworm, foodie, and family orident all of these trait are the traits i chocies because it make the person i am today.

Being family orident , i've always loved being around my family because it's gives this joy and happiness just to be around them, plus they make me feel so safe and sound when i'm with my family,all of my traits make up who i am.

Others think it's the opposite because your trait can be choose by the type influnces but i have to disagree on that because people in this world choice the kind of traits they want to have. It dosen't matter on many traits you might have they can still define who you are. Or weather if they are good traits or bad traits they can still define who you are,becuase you are your own person."
564,2B3CB2A6D7D0,"Did you know that business that partnerships the schools helps the students to know what they want to do in life. When students go to business trip with the school

They are discovering where they want to work in the future. This allow students explore where they want to work. If they wanted to work at a place that they dream of working then they are going to explore the things where they wanted to work at. I would like to explore more real estate because

I want to flip flop houses so I want to learn more about this and I want the manager of the business pick us so we can learn how those a work.

One reason, That you should pick us is how do you know if the house is good to flip and know if you going to make more money. People think that you should look in area that are growing and get house that are bad and flip the house so you can sell it for more and get more money then you payed the house and the things that made the house better.

Second reason, the manager should pick our class so we can learn How does the business work like how many house do you need to buy so that the work proceed and process. I heard that people buy three house each 6 mouth so they can work on it because some houses take one month and other houses take 4 month. Then you got to wait for the houses to sell that can take weeks or even months to sell the house to get the money.

third reason, That the manager should pick us that we want to know that if the wait of getting the money is worth it by waiting to the house to can be ready and wait so the house can get sold. People I heard that money that you wait six mouth is worth it because the money that the person get back is like more twenty thousand more on the house that you can buy a better house in a better place or keep some money. The money that you get can make a lot.

That why the manager of the real state business should pick us to visit and learn about the work because students want to learn more about this job and have question more so in the future that students will know about more then the job and maybe in there life working in this area so they can make money to. In conclusion schools should have more partnership companies that students can visit and learn about the work and that can help the students pick there job . and that can help students know what they want to do in life and proceed there dream of working and knowing what to do.

2641,C3C1D527011F,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. That could be a good opportunity for students if they finish school early they can be more independent, also can make more money a early age and build a magnificent future, another good thing it's they can buy whatever they want, and don't have to be necessary ask their parents for money also save money for their career at college.

At school we can see different kinds of age some guys are older that others, so maybe some students want to finish school a early time, If the students finish school early they can be more independent, and see how life goes life isn't easy and all of us one day will learn how to be more independent. Be independent it is a responsibility because you have to take care about something as; pay some bills, if you have car, well take care about the insurance, for some reason you live by yourself have to pay where do you live, and other responsibilities.

Second, make money a early age is a amazing thing to do because you will prepare for the future your goal is finish school, and maybe that would require extra effort like take courses during the summer, or work in the evenings to make up things that you need to do in another class, maybe that require extra work. At some point, you may not able to take elective courses but that decision is made by yourself, if your goal is finish school early you have to leave some things to get what you want. All dedication that you put, for sure you would have a recompense in the future, also don't have to worry for money because you are working hard for that.

Finish school early that can help you to be more successful like work for your own things, so if you need something you don't have ask a your parents for money; to get what you want, and another good thing is you can earn, save money for you career in college. A young age you are getting prepare to what's is next.

However, everyone choose what they want, some things would benefits your future and if you wanna make it work out in less time you can make it possible, there always another way to find out what you want, need, and to be a succeful person in the future. Build a great future would make your life easier.                "
3591,F29244150DCB,"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won't take this seriously.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school."
1137,583DC3D2E7FC,"I think that people who graduate a year early to go into the workforce, or start college early isn't a good idea or decision. People end up missing out on a lot of High school experiences. High school should be about making memories and making the best out of the four years they have left. Having time to be focusing on deciding what kind of career they want to have in the future. High school gets people ready for deciding about what they want to be when they grow up.

People who finish High school early might not be 100% sure on what they want to do or what they want to be. Also, having to take summer courses and classes takes away from having a summer and enjoying it. Spending time with family and friends, traveling. Although people have the ability to finish early you'd end up missing summer and always working on classes,doing projects,doing homework,or extra credit assignments,etc. Even though most people who finish early have a lot of pressure on them to try and get the most work done so they can finish early. It could get stressful because they're studying for exams and trying to stay on top of their grades and assignments.

I think it's better to have the full 4 years of high school because you would have more time to do things like sports, clubs,etc. Being apart of a team. Going to games and competitions. Going to powder puff home, football games, etc. Also if you're apart of a club like Photography,choir,film, or any club they would be able to make a lot more memories and have time.

Especially During their last year of high school. Missing out on senior events, senior class trips,having fun being a senior. Having Senior privileges, early release, late arrival, Eating at lunch in the senior patio. Having senior class trips, Graduating. finishing all your assignments and getting out of school a month early. Getting senior class rings, having memories of getting ready the day or night of graduation. During your senior year since your almost done with High school you get to have less classes because you have all your credits.

In conclusion i think it's best if people don't graduate early because they'd miss out on the full 4 years high school experience. Being able to make memories with friends, meeting new people throughout the 4 years. Participating in school clubs and sports teams. Making the most out of high school events like homecoming, and prom. I believe it's better and easier to graduate after the four years. "
1852,8B9EEF86DD66,"Dear Principal,

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family. I think that yes you should do this rule that if you don't have more than a C you don't get to participate in any of the school activities that we have.

600,2D63639F997F,"Is it having a possitive attitude the key to succes in life?

If someone would ask me if a possitive attitude is the key to be succesful in life. I honesty would agree with them. Because in a big part of life everyone is going to have to deal with ups and downs, Some more than others but everyone have to go through something bad for something good to happend. everyone have to fight for what they want, and on that fight is going to be bad parts and good parts but if you stay possitive most of the time you are going to win the fight , accomplish what you were loooking for and be succesful, But if you aren't just keep trying and be possitive everytime.

Always have possitive thoughts a possitive attitude and keep trying, Get up over and over intuil you accomplish your dreams, Do not give up because if something i have learn is that if you give up and think negative, you would never be succesful and know what you are actually capleble of, Thats why a lot of people is just stock in the same place because they are scare for what is going to happen, Because they have more negative thoughts then positive ones, That's making them not be succesful in life, thinking that they are better where they are and not where they can be.

A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery.

This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasn't there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wern't going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done.

The whole time i was pissitive, I wasn't scare at all i didn't have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i couln't wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive. And now i am makin almost

$1,100 per week and i'm just 18 years old still bought my second car crash it fix it and sold it then I bought me a 2017 Subaru WRX STI and my life is just going better and better some down and ups but getting up no matter wha, always trying and giving bad moments a smile and always possitive because things always are going to hapend but that's how life is. I dont know where i would be right now if i had a bad attitude all the time, and negative thoughts, thanks god i'm still here alive.

Hope you guys like it and remeber always possitive attitude.     "
783,3CDCFB2C7F25,"I believe that doing nothing is accomplishing nothing, it gets you nowhere. Being active, and having a purpose are essential in being successful, also always doing something is better then doing nothing.

To start off, being active can mean that you're accomplishing or trying to accomplish what you're doing. For example a boss of a company will always be trying to keep his business from loosing money, for he can't cant loose the company, so the boss will work towards saving the company.

Secondly, having purpose in life, or a goal is better then dreaming about it; for instance, if you ask a successful person how they got to where they are, they won't say I dreamed for it, they'll say I worked towards my goals and didn't give, even if they thought they were gonna fail.

Finally, always doing something is better then doing nothing. For example, if a student goes to school just to sit around and do nothing, he or she are wasting a opportunity to learn, and get an education towards what they want in life.

Some people might say, what if you fail pressing a goal; for instance, someone is trying to make money, or getting a job and keeps failing, they learn from the mistakes and keep the right mind set, if someone can do all that they'll flourish in the future.

In conclusion, this is why i believe doing nothing is accomplishing nothing, as Thomas Jefferson said,""Determine never to be idle"". "
984,4B6DF39107CC,"Is it a good idea to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year? Based on my experiance in high school, i disagree with students who graduate high school in three years, besause students can take college credits while they have short schedual on their senior year, and also they can get into the clubs that would give them the idea of that they would do after the graduations. In order to graduate high school in three years students must take summer school, give up on their elective courses, and give up on their vacations.

Students have to take three years of summer school in order to graduate high school early. They are required to complete all the credits that is neccessary for graduations. They must complete the requirements for graduation before it is too late. If the students chooes to skip one year of summer school credit they cannot graduate in three years, and they will have rough time trying to cought up. If they still got lazy than there is no other way to graduate then four years plan. This is where their whole stuggles end up, and they still have to be in school for the fourth year.

Students have to give up on their electives during their high school year to graduate. They will have full schedual of requirements to finish up. They have to work hard, do all the work for all of their classes, turn in almost every homework for their classes. They will be struggling during school year since they do not have an elective class that they will be not hard to think about, also some schools offers courses that would give students the ideas for their college life, such as Generic_School. It is an engineering courses that give the students idea of what they would do if they want to be an engineer.

Students will give up on their summer vocations because they will be taking summer school to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year. However students will be doing their school stuff while others will be celebrating their vocations. Students who want to finish up their schools early, they will be attending summer schools. Becide it they also be working, and maybe they wonld not have time to complete their assignments on time, it will make them to change their opinnoin on early graduation, they will give up on their early graduation plan.

To conclude, it is not the best choice to graduate high school in three years, additionally students would have rough and tamble time trying to finish high school. Therefore, it will be better if they stick with a normal school time and finish high school in four years, it will help them to get more knowledge, and better undrestainding of that they would do for their oncoming life. For the majority of people its better to graduate high school in four years, even though if they are aiming for advance deploma they will need to take full four years of high school, and summer school as well, but if the students are going for standard deploma they will have short schedual, and they can take advantage if it and take college credits for free on their senior year.

3119,DC88C1130FD9,"I agree with Bristish Prime Misnister Winston Churchill. The failure comes before of success So, I think that everybody had a failure in their lives but I think that is good because we are learning about our failure and I think that the failure is important becuse with the our failures we can be a better people for the socity or community. I think like Generic_Name goes to university and fail science class, Generic_Name had a failure but he can think about it what happen or that is wrong in science class and then, Generic_Name study a lot for recover science class. the final of semester Generic_Name recover science class, Generic_Name had a success because Generic_Name study a lot to recover science class and Generic_Name doesn't loss the hope to recover science class. So I think that the success is good for us because the success make us better. I believe that my failure that I had before that help me to be a better person to learn more to do thinks that I don't believe that i can do and the thing that a have is thanks of my success that I had it. I think if you have a lot success it is because you are donig well. If you have mistake in your life just learn about it because that help you to don't do it agian the same mistake. My concluison is The life is amazing and maybe in the future we can have fails or we can have success but the most important is that you learn abour yours mistake and yours failure because that helps you to be a better person in the community and the socity and in your life."
2752,CA3752A6A8F3,"Have you ever accomplishing something by what we are doing ? Our 3rd President of the U.S.A wrote a quote that say ""Determine never to be idle .....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Many people didn't believe in him. For a way that people would like to accomplish something is setting a goal, try hard, and showing them.

However, many people believed that setting a goal is a accomplishment. When some people set a goal they usually set an easy goal, so they can accomplish. For example, My sister when she set a goal she usually it so simple that she can accomplish it. But for some people they set their own goal really hard and they can't even accomplish it. After all for those who doesn't like setting a goal would likely accomplish something.

For many people that are accomplishing something they always try really hard. When some people accomplish something they would usually try their best to accomplishg something. For example, my brother accomlish something for trying his best at his final. But many people would not even try their best to accomplish some thing.

Therefor, many people could show what they accomplish. For those who show what they accomplish is that they usually do anything to accomplish sommething. For,exmple, Luke show to everyone what he accomplish for getting his mile run decreasing. But for some people think that is called show off. But what he did is that he accomplish something great.

As a result of accomplishing something it'swonderful thing. Like setting a goal, try your best,and showing what you have done. Accomplishing goal would be the best thing that ever happed to you. "
1277,62102D1B1A52,"Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive.

First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.

Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.

Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.

In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self."
3875,FE8B7167BD93,"Working in a group is better

People in this days are deciding rater to work in a group or work alone. There is a lot of good and bad things between these two options. Most people may choose to work in groups for differents reasons. Here are some of the reason why I think that working in group in better than working alone. Some people like to work in groups because they like to finish faster, also it is a good choice because the information taht you need to look for is divide with all the group members, finally it is good because you meet new people in the group to work with.

The first reason why working in a group is better than working alone is because you can finish faster. For example if you work by your-self on a big project you are going to take more time to finish it. Probably you can finish it on time but you are going to spend a lot of time then you. Then if you work in a group everybody in the group can hellp to get it done more fast. With the help of all the members the work is going to be done on time and you are going to have more time for yourself. With more time for yourself you can play video games, watch your favorite show or take a good time to study for another class or a test.

Another reason why working in a group is a benefit rater than work alone is because you divide the information about the topic with all the members of the group. For example if you are in high school and you get a big project then there is two choices to do it by yourself or work in group. I think most people in your class will prefer to work in groups because there will be a lot of information to look for. In a group all the members are going help in the project to get a good grade. Everybody are going to be proud of what they did together. Also they can be the best project on the class.

The last reason why working in groups is better than working alone is because everybody in the group meet new people. For example in your class you do not talk to all your classmates and this is a good opportunity to talk to them. Maybe in the past you were thinking that they were bad people but doing the project together that let you know that they are awesome. Meeting new people is good because sometimes others may feel alone and letting yourself meet them and letting them meet you, both are going to feel a different way. Sometimes what we just need is a good friend to talk and to do homework with. Some people are going to be disagree with this idea because they may not like to meet new people or because they like to be by their selves.

In conclusion working in groups is a good choice because it has good benefits. You can get more time for yourself by finishing faster with the help of your group members. You have lest information to look for because there are other members that are looking for other information. Finally you can meet new people and became a friend of them. There are some other benefits that help to work in a group and understand more about a topic with the halp of all the members."
141,0AF4F757FBEA,"The use of technology had positive effect's on people's live because help when you don't know something, help the person need and inform more quick.

First, the technology help when you don't know something, for example when you have homework and you need some answer you can look and Google. When you need know how do model or some project you can watch videos in YouTube and follow the instruction. When you don't how explain something you can to teach one images in some web side and show.

Second, can help the person need, for example when you not speak the same language to one friend or you travel some where and you need to speak you can use the Translator. Or when you have one emergency and is urgent you call the 911 and the police go quick to place. When you need know something in special only use Google and this show you many web side with many information maybe can help you.

For example, the inform more quick, for example you don't know today is rain or is cold you only need to look the climate in your phone and you have the answer. When something happen and is bad in your country or some place your phone notify with one messenger. When you have the long time you not talk with your mom and can't visit you call and is more quick.

Also some people thing the use of technology had negative effect's on people's live because when something is many easy the people got lazy or when you use the phone not put attention to anything because you only concentrated in your phone; however, the technology is one resource can help to many forms. In conclusion the technology is good when you use correctly."
2078,9C3D2911E32D,"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family.

However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea.

In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.

Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble.

Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.

In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true! "
3090,DB6B9E64CFF0,"All around the world involves people learning something new. We learn about different creatures, peoples ,and objects. An Individual that is willing to learn more each and everyday will succeed in life. Some people believe that Emerson statement ""unless someone try to do something beyond what they've have already mastered will grow"", but I disagree. I believe people who try to do something beyond what they've have already mastered, they will never grow because due to lack of experience, and not enough knowledge.

To begin with, every individual want to become something in life. There's literally a certain career that every individual is discovering for. People who wants to learn, participate in certain activities or classes would most likely get the dream career as they wish. Putting the effort is the answer to everyone problems. For instance, my friend Generic_Name shes a server at a restaurant. She is nineteen years old. Generic_Name has been working there since she was 17 years old already. Therefore, Generic_Name knows all of the meals that are served, places that need to be restocked etc. Unfortunately, she getting tired of the job. For some reason, she doesnt want to try something new.

Having only one job experience is barely enough for the person to know about different experiences from other jobs. I strongly believe,as if Generic_Name does not put effort into applying for a new job. She will never grow out of her self esteem or confidence into getting a new job. Clearly, getting involved into different jobs will even give you different alternatives.

Pursuing this further, knowledge is very important when it comes to trying something new. Individuals need to know atleast some knowledge when trying to reach further into their career

For example, my eighth grade teacher Generic_Name would sometimes sit with me at lunch. We would discuss about anything. One day, I brought up about going into high school. Since my middle schools years were coming to an end. I asked her if their were any advice for my upcoming freshman year. She told me high school it will get harder . Also, I needed to become more serious about my education. Mostly likely I will have to pass all exams, sols ,and keep my GPA high. These are the years I will0 start thinking about what I want to do with my career. She gave me advice to guide me through to become better. I strongly oppose, knowing more knowledge about something will make yourself grow.

Obviously, if an individual is trying to do something beyond then what they've already mastered, they will never grow. Just by having lack of experience will lead the individual feeling in their comfort zone. Also, the lack of knowledge will leave the person clueless. Some people may argue that unless the person try to do something beyond what they have mastered, they will grow. How can someone grow from repeating on doing what they do on a normal basis? How can they learn something new with such little knowledge? For example, my dad came to United States when he was 14 years old. He knew little English. Also, he knew how to write some words, but that was all that he knew. He put his full time effort to learn a new language. Each step he took he accomplished. He himself grew out of the stage of not knowing something. He went beyond into what he really wanted.

Finally, everyone needs experience and knowledge in order to grow. Imagine doing a science project on an unknown animal. Surprisingly this creature changes colors, sizes, and shape. Wouldn't you want to invest in the creature more? Learn how the creature lives? Or you would just want to know the basic facts of it? "
3535,F06D9612B900,"One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frog's interior . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it did'nt smell good either . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we human's do . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasn't a lot of organs in there

And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frog's stomach . And that part definently disgusted me but it didn't made me want to stop either.

After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frog's eye . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frog's eye was'nt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . Fortunently it did'nt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself .

After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was defenently a lot of fun .

Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasn't as amazing and funny as the other project . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didn't see anything i was kind of dissapointed . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project .

And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . Because they make class a little more interesting . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And that's why i think they are the best . "

2833,CE43DBA12965,"The growth of technology has made it convenient for people to use anywhere and any time. Technology has made it easier for people to do online education, jobs, and shopping. People are now in favor of this technology growth.

First, online education has made it easier for students to study at home without worrying about how they are going to get to school. I'm in favor of the online education because it made it easier for me to take my online classes at home and I can do my assignment any time I want to do it. The online education is also convenient for students in colleges; most of the students in colleges study at home because they don't have to worry about transportation, nor the gas money for their car. My brother is in college and where he lives they get a lot of snow in the winter, so it make it hard for to go to college. Now he does not have to worry about the weather because he can study for his classes online.

Second, most people are now doing online jobs because the grown of technology. In my opinion the most popular online job is to be a you tuber; a lot of you tubers film their lives and put on the internet then the get money of it. One of my friend is a you tuber and he gets decent amount of money just form putting videos of him self on the internet. The way YouTube work is the you tuber up lodes a video on YouTube and if he gets a lot of views then he gets a lot of money. Another online risky job is buying and selling in stocks. One time I bought an online stock form the company Tesla and it was really good price, after three months I sold the stock double the amount that I bought it in the first time. When people buy stocks from other company is like having a percentage of the company that buyer own. The risky part about it is people never now when the stock will go up or down.

Third, online shopping has made it convent for people to order everything online. The most popular online delivery is Amazon; Amazon made people lives so much easier by having everything delivered to their houses. When I order online I always order from Amazon this company has everything I need for me and for my family. Amazon also has fresh grocery that they deliver it for the costumers in the same day that they order it. In these modern days other stores are now delivering online, so people can buy their needs while they are at home.

Although technology has made people lazy and decreased the communication between humans, but it made easier for student to do their homework, it made it easier for people to make money while they are at home, and it made easier for those people who don't like to do grocery shopping in the stores.

In conclusion the growth of technology has helped a lot of people with their lives including student and online workers. All people are in favor of this amazing growth of technology because it has helped them to make their lives easier. I think that people are going to proceed with growth of the technology because it's making people lives run smoothly.            "
3124,DCDDFA12E124,"We humans aren't really perfect, there hasn't been one human that has never made a mistake, for example the person that is writing this prompt, has had a decent amount of failures in his life. One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didn't know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesn't want to fail this senior year.

If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesn't sound right, does it? i'm from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that ""my child is better than yours"". So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didn't seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didn't mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didn't care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School.

I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldn't happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didn't know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me ""Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and I said ""I'm sorry, I didn't know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""It's fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order.

By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. It's not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager that's a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they don't affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane.

Me failing makes me stronger, it's like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it.

If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, it's impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like i'm doing homework, pretending like i'm listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didn't want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and i'm making sure that i'm happy, more than anyone else, I'm not going to let any negativity impact my life.

My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and don't let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing.""

In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesn't affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes it's a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you can't resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called ""Winston Churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with his opinoin."
850,4148186C6D84,I have seen a lot of people in a bad attitude because something happens that they dont likes examples= 2. failed in a test that's an attitude of worrying.3 More examples like you and your friends got into a fight and they are always in worry that if we could be friends one again and that depends on their attitudes. 4. Another one is when your parents get into a fight that makes your kids in a worry thinking that there might be a separation beetween them.5. some people are worry while taking a test worrying that they might fail the test.6. Another example is getting bad grades similar to failing.7. And more getting bullied and no one even stands up for them that's a depressed attitude and might decides to kil them self.8. More attitude is acting cool in a class and behaving not well enough and even cussing at a teachers.9. There is another point when you've got an attitude dont show to your friends you probably dont want them to worry too and if you do that way you are spreading your worry and everyone will be and that is not good.

476,23FC0A3DF4C9,"In my opinion, I do believe that it should be an elective classes for students to take art, drama, and music classes because it has nothing to do with our education. It won't help us in the future because all you need to learn is how to get a good job, pay for bill and electricity, food, gas, and water. It has nothing to do with our and it should be optional for students to take any art classes whenever they like the class and the second reason is that students might not like the classes because they will be not be interested and will be bored because art is really not their thing. Students like to listen to music, party, go on social media, sports, video games, talking to friends, and being cool. But they don't want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they don't like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either don't like being there and just skip the class or they're not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting but it has nothing to do with students futures either. These classes are something that are easy, Something that you are good at, and something that interests you. So in my opinion it should be elective classes and not classes that should be required to graduate."
762,3ADC97CB1DB6,"First impression can change. Most of the times they do change. It's rare for someone to act the same once you've met them because eventually they change. Nothing really is the way it seems to be. When it comes to first impression its always important to act a certain way. Everything changes , people change, things change eventually.

When it comes to first impression people always change. Sometimes when you meet someone they always want to seem kind to the other person for them not to think anything bad of them but good. When you go into a job interview you want to dress appropriately, you also want to act appropriate, and respectful with the other person when that may be out of your comfort zone. Some people can change in a relationship they act all sweet at first but then one day they'll just switch up on you and act different and be different from when they first met the person. Most of the times thats always the case people just act different from what they got in their first impression.

Nothing seems like the way it should be. Meeting people is nice but from what you can gather from the first impression is not always enough. I've met people who have thought i was mean because of the way I looked that was their first impression on me but then they said when they started to actually have a conversation with me and actually talked with me they realized that I was really nice and not mean. Thats the thing about the first impression it always changes. People can look at certain way but act completely different. I like to dye my hair different colors some people find that intimidating because of how I look but i'm a nice person I love to meet people and talk but it may not look like I do.

Meeting people is an important thing in life. Everyone is always meeting people which means first impressions matter. When you meet someone you dont want them to hate you, you want them you like you. You have to act nice and polite even if you are not in the mood to be nice or even if you're the meanest person you have to be respectful with others around you. You change the way you are most people do it and dont realize that they do change from when they first were with the other person. I've met friends who i thought would do good for me in my life because of my first impression with them but turned out to be toxic and bad for me. When you see a rose it beautiful, it has a beautiful color to it, it smells good bur when you want to grab it there are thorns and it hurts you.

In conclusion things arent always the way it should be. Everything changes , First impressions always changes it's possible. It takes times to sometimes notice the change but people do change from there first impression ."
2762,CA8DAD4BCC7A,"Should students graduate earlier from high school? Graduation earlier have been the choice that a lot of students on make on their lives. They may feel over-confident when they are clear about what are their accomplishments and the things that they have to do to reach it. It is not that easy as it sounds because they need to prepared themselves and notify that it will be difficult to reach their goals. However at the end they will see that was for a good and valuable things for their lives. They might will need to work hard and feel like to exceed themselves. It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge.

Students that graduate earlier need to have enthusiasm and know that they will have a more difficult life and realize that they will have more responsibilities and duties in society, when they are out of school they should take that as an advantage to use their time wisely and help themselves by trying to find a job and earn some money; if they are taking the decision to go to college in few years. It is hard to find a job when the time pass and they did not practice all the things that they learn in the past and then realize that they should do sometime productive same as when they were in high school before they graduate.

In addition they will be helping their parents same as they did it when they were in school, by supporting and care about of them, they will be contributing in home and society. Also, they will have others accomplishments that they might want to reach it and celebrate with their families and make them feel proud and happy of their goals. Understanding that all the things that they did are for have good benefits and others people will used as good thing to defend or help themselves.

Finally, all students have the same capacity to show up and do the right things, after they graduate they have the opportunity to find a job and demonstrate how the develop their skills and knowledge. Staying positive and knowing that they can do great and specials things will make them feel proud of their works and then they will prove that they can do amazing things like everybody does. Providing high qualities of themselves in a workplace can help them to know and find new information about what things are happening in the world that round them.

Students should be thinking what they want do in their future or after high school since when they are growing up because that will help them to clear their minds and thoughts. Working hard and doing it with enthusiasm that is how they will be success in their future. Earning money by working honestly later that will be a big step to start a career in college, helping people and communities will make them feel more productive and helping their attitudes to stay confident, brave, and strong all the time with themselves,demonstrating their abilities and capacities is how they will be success in their futures lives."
2953,D42B6354404D,"Dear Principal

I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and don't like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade.

If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and you'll be able to play what ever sport you want.

Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person. If you try your best you will get to play sports and join in activities you like. Your decision depends on you if you make a good decision you will get what you want if you don't you don't get everything that you want.

Love,

672,340BCFE7E249,"When elementry students have a lesson on what they are about to learn. It is very important because they need to pay attention what is the teacher is teaching the class. Elementry school students should know what is the lesson is on, they should take notes if they a quiz or sol on it. Students should pay attention in class because if you don't pay attention in class, you don't know what is the lesson is about. If a student doesn't know what is the lesson is on, then find a way to explain what is the lesson is on. Some students that don't pay attention in class, then asks them what is the lesson is about?

Some students don't like to pay attention in class becuse they don't want to learn about the lesson that is given to them. The teachers have to give the lesson because so the elementry school students can learn more things. They can also help the elementry school students if they are having trouble misunderstanding the lesson that the the teacher is given. Teachers have to pay attention to the kids to make sure that they are learning something everyday. The teacher's job is to teach elementry school students to learn something everyday they come into school. Other teachers might help other students to learn more about the lesson that the teacher was given to them. The whole elementry school can also help with the lesson that kids are having misunderstanding about the lesson is been given to the teachers. Teachers can help the student on the other things that part of the lesson.

achers are helping the kids learn something everyday because if the kids are not learn nothing then, the kids don't know anything about the lesson. Elementry school students should learn the lesson so they can do more things about the lesson, but if the elementry school students don't know what they are learning then, they don't know what other things to do about the lesson. Other kids might help the kid that doesn't know a lot everyday. They can also help each other out. The teachers can help the students learn something everyday. If a student didn't know something in the lesson then, the teacher can help them on it.

The elementry school students should ask about the lesson. If a student doesn't know how to do the other things that go with the lesson then, ask the teacher how to do it. If elementry school students know more things about the lesson then, they know how do the other things about the lesson. They can also help other students that don't understand what is the lesson is talking about. The elementry school teachers can if a way to explain to the student doesn't understand what is the lesson is talking about. This is what is important to elementry kids.

I hope elementry school students can learn more things in the future. Students should pay attention class so they know what is the lesson is talking about. Teachers should keep an eye on the students that they are paying attention and they are learning something everyday. The students that don't pay attention should pay attention in class, so the student can understant what is the lesson is talking about and the student can learn something new everyday when the student go to school. Students should learn new things when they go to school eveyday. "

Also some students don't like eat new thinks because they like eat the same food all day. In adition some students have alergy for some food so they need to know what they eat if they have problems with the healthy.

However another people are agree about this plant because eat the same food all day is bored they don't like that. In adition the food of the school is not healthy for all students, the food they give to the students have not protein and that is a problem for the students,

because they can have deceased. Also some students like to eat new think they like enjoy differents tipes of food.

In my opinion the school need to change the school menu because more students are agree about this plant. The opinion for a lot students is change the menu because they are bored eat the same food all day the studens need to eat new think.

In conclusion some students are disagree about this plant of change the menu of the cafeteria because they don't like eat new thinks because they think meybe the food is not good or something can affect the organism.

3720,F83702EEB830,"I agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. Helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper.

In conclusion I think that everyone has to do something is school it doesnt matter what but we have to. School is not just for learning and being bored in class, school is for you to be happy and confortle with everything, we can make school fun."
2840,CEAD27DE3263,"We tend to accomplish more if we always do something. In my opinion, I think that if people want to accomplish more, then they would do more to make their lives better. For example, a teen who gets eight hours of sleep before school wont be tired then a teen who slept for three hours. The teen who slept more will accomplish a successful school year because he slept earlier. Responsibility is a big role of being able to accomplish something; unfortunately, not everyone's responsible.

There are many ways someone can accomplish something, but they all start out with them taking action. as an example I'm going to use Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both of these men started out with nothing. no one knew who these two men were 13 years ago. But that all changed when both of them announce their new technology. If it weren't for them, no one would have these useful items: IPhone, Android, Xbox, Window computers, etc. However, the reason they accomplished all that, was because they both studied and worked hard.

Inactivity can also serve a purpose in a person in my opinion. I think that people who do not want to accomplish something is because they do not want to push themselves into doing so. Another reason I think that they're not pushing themselves is because they don't have anyone to support them or help them out. Those are two main reason why I think people are inactive.

In conclusion, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. you cannot simply do nothing and wait for it to be accomplished by itself. everything thing you do now will lead to a bigger accomplismnet. If you want to be sucessful, you always have to do something, Even though it's little things like helping your parents cook, or washing the dishes. "
2700,C6EB01B2D6B8,"MY SCHOOL SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THIS MODEL BY EXTENDING THE SCHOOL DAY BY TWO- HOURS

The addition of two hours to the school day will benefit the school poorly but,

will cause a huge disadvantage to students and the school as a whole. The four - day work week will not be beneficial to my school because,

it would reduce the amount of time students have for other activities,

and also this will result in the inability of students to learn more, and as a result students are affected mentally and psychologically.

To begin with, the school day has been designed in a special way which gives students, a reasonable amount of time to involve themselves in after school activities. These activities help the students acquire other skills different from what we acquire in school. For example, students who also take part in sports do not have enough time to practice or train after school if these 2 hours are added. Other students who work after school will begin to work fewer hours because they also need time to study and revise. As a student, time is needed to attain your goals and time also determines your future.

In addition to, the student brain can't function as well as an adult brain after some hours of serious work .The brain becomes tired and needs rest after some time, but the adult brain can do more because it is well developed than the student brain. After lunch, the students can study to a maximum of 3 hours only before feeling sleepy or tired and if these hours are extended, students will feel reluctant to study, which makes these extended hours a waste of time. Due to this, students won't take these hours seriously but will only disturb or disrupt the class which produces no positive result at the end of the class. The school makes sure that wastage of time is extremely prevented to produce positive outcomes and results.

Furthermore, to become a successful student, individuals must be mentally upright and psychologically sound to allow learning to be much easier and convenient. If these 2 hours are added to the school day, the students won't be mentally stable because, they would be stressed from pushing themselves to learn more even tho they are tired. Psychologically, this will reduce a student's ability to understand new things being thought and also prevents them from revising past information or work given. If this is happens, students will begin to forget past information and how to apply them which will become a problem in the near future.

Conclusively,this four - day work week would benefit other other institutions but won't benefit an institution like my school because my school works and remains successful mainly by the use of precious time and effort.

3543,F0E76CC2EF7A,"I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may have other plans or don't want to do an extra activity. Students may have different plans for there future and want to work on what they want to do. Some students want to focus on graduating school.

It also may cause problems on most students. Students want to do less work at a time. Doing an extra activity may cause students to panic with a lot of work to do.

Another reason I disagree that all student must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may not like that there is a lot of activity they have to choose from. Most students like to do things on there own or at home on there bed or personal space. Many students don't like to do activity with other people around them and going with what the teacher wants them to do."

there are so many ways technology can be used. Back then there wasnt technology and it was hard to communicate with peolpe that lives far away but now with the help of cellular devices it makes it much easier for peolpe to communicate. Kids now love to play in video games and pareants dont have to worry of their children going out and also they can use their tables to read a book with out going to the library and checking out books.

Technology has helped people around all over the world, and it can make things people never seen or done before now a days you dont even have to go out and buy stuff you can just use your moblie phone and go online and purchase the things you want and it can be delivered to your door.

technology has great effects and one of them is evolving, it helped evolved the world and has made many chances and many postive effects like education,

215,101E0C554F66,"Have you ever thought of an outdoor activity that aided you, your families, and friends? while there are some activities that aid you and other groups of people, one of the most helpful is going to the park. it is good to go to the park because you can ride your bike, and because you can spend time with your family.

going for a ride in you bike to the park is good for your body and mind because your leg movements aid the muscles, the fresh air blowing in your face feels relaxing, and because you can burn unnecessary calories while riding.

It is good to go to the park with your family because you can get some helpful advises from them, because you can have a stronger bond with you family and/or friends, and because you can talk about life problems and how to solve them.

it is best to fly a kite at the park because when flying kites, you have to maintain it's height which is a good challenge, because you can compete with friends, and because you can teach others how to fly a kite

Overall, riding a bike and spending time with your family are both good things to do at the park. life aiding activities exist outdoors all around the world. Going to the park is a good choice when thinking about family or frineds.                  "
3330,E6A0D625F9C3,"I am disagree with this statement because thing that are made up from mind seems to be not real. First, Knowledge created stuff that is real. Lastly, Knowledge can make you be rich.

Knowledge created stuff that exist. For examples: a car that had been made by a knowledgeable person, can solve your life time problems, but an imaginary car is not real at all. all human have the knowledge to read. People today have invented a lot of things because of their knowledge. In conclusion, there are so many stuff that had been invented(created) true knowledge.

If you present the thing you invented from your knowledge, a company might respond to you and say,""hey, people really loved your invention. we should work together."" For example you have the skill to invented a phone, and you solled that phone to a person and you made a huge amount of money. You would want to invent more and more to make a lot of money. You learn that skill from knowledgeable teacher. In conclusion, knowledge can help you with your life time.

3816,FC2050EA9039,"The world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. Trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. Even if you don't believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow.

Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things.

It can't hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesn't make sense to try and understand a concept that won't make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I can't grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why it's not possible to master difficult problems.

Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because it's not so much a person can't grow but don't have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent.

In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement. A person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. Based on my experiences, I understood that trying something I never mastered will only make me grow as a person.                                                  "
2212,A4F11F4A76AE,"Students should enjoy summer break, cause they would not have to worry about school and they can get to relax some educators should not complain about summer break being too long cause having a long break is better than to go to school cause school you have to do work and do tests. but in during the summer break you get to relax all day summer is the time to hangout with your friends and famiy and to go to vacation to enjoy life too and not think about school or work that is what summer is all about and for educators saying that students are not going to remember what they learned in school. from last year when they come back to school is not true cause some people remember what they learned last year and some don't and i don't think summer break should be 3 to 4 weeks cause most of time students are in school more than they get to have a long break. i think summer break should be for 2 months so people can have a break from school cause i know how school can be stressful for students cause they have to worry about a lot of things passing their classes passing their sols that gets stressful to students. cause that is the most important things in school i think for winter break has to be 2 weeks cause of chrimstmas and new years that time is too enjoy those 2 holidays with your family and then come back to school in january. for spring break should always be in March not in April cause it has always been spring break in March spring break should be 2 weeks to take a break from school and to come back in school with a fresh mind to get ready to go to school and learn. so the students can be prepared the only break in fall is thankgiving which is only a week that seems fair cause is just the 2nd holiday in November having breaks is always a good thing i don't know why some people hate it it gets you time to think about things it helps people a lot to relive stress on people it makes people happy and puts a smile on people's faces and that is all i have to say about all the breaks for the seasons.

1715,82294A32E3E3,"I believe that people whom value their self, should be guide for a person who they admire, so they can look at them like a great example to follow and hopefully one day be like them or better.

People always make mistakes even though when some times we don't admit it, no matter how good we are on something people always need help we can not always do things by our own. we always require someone to tell us that we are doing wrong .

Even in some circunstance we need to grow up and believe and our self, that we have the capacity like everyone else, to make our dreams comes true even when things goes wrong, that does not mean anything is just a challenge that we need pass to make us strongers.

However, just for being clear doing things by your own is fine, but if we have the incredible disponibility to have someone always there for you who you trust in. I think is the safe way to go because todays days those person whom use to give you advice and support you rarely appear, so do the best person you can and remember ask for help is just an option to help you out and improve the best of you."
2226,A643E3470F54,"No,I don't think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework.

You can't even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep they're getting and If kids come to school the next day,they won't get the information they need for their classes because they're tired.

Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in won't be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why they're not getting enough sleep. I'm not saying it's impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it it's likely students won't get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students can't graduate from high school.

To rap this up I say that the main reason why I don't think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future."
3075,DACE7A4DE7DB,"I agree with this statement, because a positive attitude helps you cope more easily with the daily affairs of life. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful.

Whith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing.

Also a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you.

If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. I'ts as if you radiate light around you.

When you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and don't lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. understand that is important to take resposibility for one's actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation.

Being positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin.

Positive attitude is the key to sucess in lifen because if you are positive you will belive and trust yourself, and you won't let negative people affect your deams, if not you will work hard until you get them and go will sucessful.

In this day ling life to be yourself individuality in this world. distinguish, normal, healthy, sane condition, and selves. Is the greats accomplishment by Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

I agree with this, In this time we has a human being trying to be an unique person. A music artists, drawing artists, or a teacher etc.. as an example; A teacher can trying to do something especial with his students. That can be something that nobody did it before. That make an unique teacher and that can end really bad or good either this, people going to judge he/she, however; the world constantly trying to make you different. And that change is gonna be to make you a unique person. When Author wrote ""To make you something else"".

Negative persons consisting trying to change you, make you something else or judge. For my opinion that simple thing can be strong. Why? is the way that you looking, as an example; they gonna judge, but you gonna be strong and not worry about that, because you are a human being in this life nobody is ""perfect"". We can be unique in this life, we also can guide by people are already death. In the past, a member of your family, a artists, or a person that did a great job or something unique. that can also help us to get some ideas, as an example; the men who created ""Facebook"", this person is unique. because he created something inclusive that beans created before Is a positive change of the ""life system"". What I trying to say it is. In the cycle of life, we as a human being; born, growing up, reproducing, and dead end. In the cycle an example; when we are in the stage of growing up, they let us know to understand that we have to made a decision. For example: ""What you want to be in this life when you old?"". this trying to understand that we have to make a decision to contribute to this ""life system"". To make it better world as an example; teenager trying to decide a career for college, to contribute something good for this world, however; that decision of the teenager can be, wherever he or she want. People can judge or be bad with you, but the end of the day. It no important anymore. This is only one life to live wherever you do with this life, is your decision. But we have to smart."

The students will have more time to do their homeworks to concentrate more in classes. Many high schools the tradicional is four years of high school that is a good choice for the students. Students will have more experience having four years of high school. The students will learn more things in one more year of high school.

The benefits taking four years of high school.

Students are able to take elective classes.

Concentrate more taking four years of high school.

Students will have more time to do their homeworks.

Students will be more prepare for college.

They will have more time to study for the exams.

Free time.

Less stress.

I do not recomment to the students take three years of high school. Because there is many classes that students cannot take that are elective classes take three years of high school is not a good choice for the students who work after school.

2652,C4472C6DFE66,"Some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem even if the work is not the students best effort.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Also students they has the last world, if they need to practice the things the some people thinking to the benefit for their self-esteem.

1. Reason some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree, i think this is not the best way to improve in their self-esteem, because students they believe in praising but, this is not the option to learn in their self-esteem they need to focus in their achievements. even if some people belief on praising,they think this help students to believe in praising i think students believe in this source but is not the principal option to believe in praising they need to focus in their achievements, values and skills because is one the priority and purpose to believe in their self-esteem this ideas must be to help to lean focus.

Students need to improve in their achievements, because some people are not sure if this come from, praise or achievements. I think this are two different thinks, also one is believe in religion, for example: I belief in Jesus this is praise they don't need to compare, but i don't dismiss this idea,because is good idea to students believe in praising. Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand.

597,2D3E794C5206,"Our world if full of a lot different people from around the world. And we all have different goals and diffrent ways to see our life. Thoma Jefferson wrote ""Determinenever to be idle..it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" as

I read this quotes

I strongly believe that we acomplished more if we are always doing something. if everyone would think the same way we all can reach beyond more. Students now days they don't have a lot of goals or motivation in life .And if we determine ourself to keep going; we will succeed in life. Attending collegue or always being involve in daily activity such a yoga clases, painting or being involve in afterschool programs. It will determine us not to be worthless.

First of all,as we finish HIgh school we all should attend college . And keep our education going beacuse the more knowledge we get the smater we are. I personaly feel that i acomplished more when I focused on reaching my goals.

As a prepare myself to graduate this year from High School. Im looking forward to go to colllege to study Early childhood. Attending college is going to be one of my biggest dream. And looking foward to become a professor. The key to sucess is to work hard.

Sencondly, being involve in daily activities give people joy and feel motivate. Some people loves helping in after programs or during school. As we get involve in this activies; we acomplish a lot by helping people that they need and also it helps us humas to be better for our community. My sister helps an afterschool program that helps the little kids to do their homework and some crafting project . She shares with me that working on this gives her gratitude and is helping her on the career that she is studying. Persuing this goals brings us pleasure because we are helping others.

At the end, the sociey we live in today, we all think and act differently but, if we all implement the quote the Thomas jefferson wrote; we will be living a a complety different planet. It is admirable how much it will be done if we are always doing something. We don't see how much this changes impact our daily life until we impliment them. I feel that attending to college while working is a great choice because it can help persue peoples dream and accomplish more in life. "
997,4C60445C5681,"I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.My friend, PROEPR_NAME attend to school she has two jobs, but in the last few months she does not attend to classes because she works too much that is hurt herself , but she does not have any other option PROPER_NAME, is independent.

However some students work to help with pay the rent, pay bills I know some students that would like to attend to school, but the do not have the opportunity for some reason .For example does not have enough time, or falling sleep every time that try to weak up to go to school is not easy work and study every day that is brave.

The idea here is to support teenagers to prepare for the future

someone will be the next president of the United States, or a professional doctor that will help many people from many countries.We can help our teenagers for a better future as school is our responsibility to work with them.

In conclusion students,

Should have the opportunity to attend classes from home and work as the same time to help their parents and the most important prepare for the future. "
1464,71129FE0D18F,"Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits.

One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to his mom's immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game.

Another reason is some students have no financial support. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems.

Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school.

Graduating within three years is a good idea it helps students end up with their high school diploma while also helping there problem. I agree that gradating within three years is a good idea for students who need and choose it. "
1742,83F57096AF9C,"Be a master in any area is something really awesome, because you already have experience and you already know what are you doing. There is positive and negative things for being a master.

In my opinion

I disagree with Emerson becasue even if you are a master in an specific area you never stop growing, everyday you learn more about your mistakes and about life and how to live a good one, also you learn something new that helps you in all types of areas that you have in your life.

However in this world there will be someone that will disagree with your opinion, because they have different type of mentality,or they think in a different way.

If you have a goal you never need to stop growing on it, becasue is something that you really want for your future and you want to do that for the rest of your life. That is why you need to choose carefully what do you want, because maybe in the future you can regret and that is a bad thing that you can erase,becasue you feel frustrate because you spend a lot of time on something that you didn't like.

Being an expert in an area is something really important, the positive things for being a master is that:

You domain your area and nobody needs to command you.

You can do the things easily and quickly.

You are an expert in what are you doing, so you are exited.

Is more easier to get good things, something that benefits you.

You can get great jobs with a good payment.

You can be also your own boss or manager.

There is also negative things for being a master:

There are many people that they are an expert in any area

You need to compet with your rival

You need to try to be the best

If you have a business and you are making some mistakes you need to fix it quickly because it can affect to your own skills.

In conclusion

I disagree with Emerson, becasue you can still growing even if you are making a lot of mistakes, you can still achieve new things,you need to grow in person and in skills,always.

You can stay in the position that you are right now but you can always grow and be better everyday."

241,11E5C01714C5,"Dear Generic_Name,

Our school gave opportunity to us, students, that will allow us to explore occupation through your internship. Although, some people may say that it will just be a waste of time for students but for me its not. As a student i don't want to miss any opportunity given to me that will help me to be more prepared for the future, give me more experience, and lead me to success.

Firstly, this internship will help me be prepared more for the future. Since I'm still young I still haven't made up my mind on what kind of job i wanted to have, so through this internship i will have the chance to explore the occupations that i can get and make up my mind and have a decision. Therefore, this internship will help me on being ready for the future.

Secondly, this internship will give me more experience. Experience is great way for learning and discovering new things. There's this saying that ""You will never know until you try"". For example, my friend hated the thought of her dancing but when one of our teachers asked us to dance, she discovered that she was really good at dancing. Through this internship i may discover things that never really crossed my mind but actually good at it.

Thirdly, this internship will help me lead to success. This internship will help me plan for my future and not just do anything that will cross my mind. After this internship i already know what job i should get, know what to do and what to expect, and be more confident and more prepared. This internship will lead me to success because it will help me boost up my confidence and help me do better on my future job.

If i were to be selected i will do my best and everything i can for this internship because i don't wan to miss the chance of being prepared for the future, get more experience, and most importantly will lead me to success."

There is a bounch of students that have problems with slow internet, some times the internet doesn't

load the wed pages and with slow internet we can not due our online classes. One time i was with my friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every day and then the internet when down and he did not finish his class online and the internet didn't work until the next day.

Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we wan to eat, our parents need help and they call us and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online.When i was in LOCATION_NAME i took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what i was doing classes online and he call me more then 3 times and because i was using my headphones and i did not ear when he call me the 3 times he get mad, he disconnect the computer and the computer shot down, i did not finish the class beacuse of my auncle and the teacher tell me that i was so disrespectfull to her and she didn't wan to give me classes again.

One of the most common problem is the student don't have time for example we have jobs and we don't have time for classes online. Some of the students are in club or they go to church, they also take care of there little brothers, with these reasons is why taking classes at home is not a really good idea.

Do you really thing that taking classes online can benefit student? Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow WI-FI and also problems or differences with family that may affect us in our concetration with the classes, that's why i don't agree of having classes online.

1501,73851AC4551C,"78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger."

From my experience in life is that I want to be ronaldo when I was 15,16,year old and that wasn't good because it change my mind set not to be myself and to be someone else.

474,23D5BA721F52,"Do you always have to be honest at all time?

Well do you agree with me because I do think you should be honest.

Well sometimes it is not good to be truthful because some people are crazy humans in this world. You should always be honest to your family. They appreciate you more than anything. I think being honest will always be great think for this generation. The benefit of being honest at all times because your friends will know your trustworthy,parents love that more than anything,and you're not a lair.

My first reason is your friends have more trust in you. They will have a better friendship most likely. Friends will buy things for you like shoes,shirts,and shorts. Some times friends don't like that much honest because they might feel sad and stress out like when my sister came back from Generic_City from college. My sister friend was honest but my sister felt sad because it was heartbreaking to her. But any away my sister is find now living her best live. Your friends will dislike your honesty and like your honesty. They might tell you secrets that they never told there parents.

Another reason is parents love you more if your honest in my opinion. They care for more than anything. They gave you a life. Even if your friend said something very bad you should tell them anyways because they will probably help your friend that is need of help. They love you more than anything. Being honest to your mom and dad are the most. In the past I will always lie and you can picture the next thing. Sometimes parents hate when there child tells everything to there cousin,and which my mom hates children .

My last reason is your not gonna be a liar if you become honest at all time. In my religion if you are liar or not honest at anytime you are a liar. God will forgive you if you ask forgiveness. You will have better life and future. I sometimes like being honest because adults like hearing the truths and I wanna be that kind of kid. I like being that good kid and quite kid that loves being friends from a long time ago. I hate when people lie than walk and they try to be honest. Sometimes people I think should not lie and e honest.

In conclusion, the benefit of being honest at all time because is great for you. I think being great will make your family great as well as people around you. I think friends will love you more than anything. You are a great human being as like your parents. I think having a wonerful time being great person. As being honest everybody esle will be honest. Some honesty is bad for other friends are cool with it. God will forgive you as well as your parents. The honest person will always win.

2922,D2C7BE42DEF6,"Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to to a career at a young age?

You can think about you own opnion , and get in your own word your conclusions and read the 2 reason and one example, ideas and one view the prompt follow the anwers in the same tittle.

2 Reason.

Good and bad.

1..Good reason...

I thing some students need to commit to a career at a young age because the young age, see the world in different forms, when the olders people dont see anymore becase, were see different because if somethink gift stop i get stop but the young students is different.

2..Bad reason..

I think is bad too because you young you see the world in different around you but is good too beecuase you can think the everythink impossible for olders;. is any stop for your show that you get a opportunities but the reality is different.

Example.

If you go to High School if you here in 10 grade but you get 17 years old, and you get a jod because you have a single mother if the work of you momm its imposible for pay everythig what you need for survive. you stop too go of follow you career and you said i dont due anymore, why because you see the real what is happening and you need something else, but when you think and young world you said i can help my mother and I also too I can finish my career too because you see if you want or need something you can get..

Ideas.

Young age Students can get more Imagine.

Can think that everything is possible.

Can get more opportunities for the future.

Some true reasong that you can see example.

The young age student is the future the tomorrow conclusion..

Anything can stop you, if you are student young age because is not matter in you age but and you think you can due and you show how you are ?you can due eveythink nothing is impossible because you can get stop in you career or you goals only if you permit this in you future or now everithing is depend you, and the young age is the future of tomorrow is something that i can said is true.

View the Prompt.

Do you see the all conclusion that people can get in the hands, but olders that is not mean that you feel ready for what you whant that is mean, you feel ready and you what is happenig and you now can said when you need the stop and get you own conclucion the you... I see one video that now the young age student that olders said not because you young you dont born for this or for stupid reason now that young age student have money and power and the society or margen that humant create.. The reasong why? is because they never forgive whent style young age what people want and need for they futures."

One idea for student's is they every school realized every year differents options in menu for bote students in one sitio web and when they have a results change the menu in school is a very well benefit for students because when you eat good your brain is more concentrate in your work is have more energy, one idea is in the morning take a frut's, or cofee and then in loch eat popeyes,chipotle,tacos and others more options because students in a long time is omg again this food the point is change food in school every year differents options for eat it's good have differents menu for year eat new food.

School is need created the importants points they students need realized after school teh first is the every students is need due ten minutes the exercise then go to lonch and take foood for eat then go to your regular classes in teh 10:00am go to lonch and eat tacos,popeyes,chipotle etc. and drink a natural water they contained natural fruts then keep going with your classes is very well take differents options in the school they realized for students look for your benefit and students is more concentarte,have new energy brain always positive because the change is wounderful in your life is very well health.

In my conclusion they schools is have created every year new questions or format's in sitio web for comparate, conform pass the years and then change the menu and see they better options for food like eat for students it's a very well idea for students and teachers for drinks is good always contained differentes water the fruts natural because is very good how you body contained water and eat good is very health for your body someone students they have sports with more reason they need have a good network nourishment's for conbained full energy in the coaching is very good contained witch a lot variety the food are the students and someone the teachers is take food they more like.

Course always included the good health for your body the big poin is they creater sitio web for students can visit every year before star the school due one the formation they have every school for it's for facile take the opinions and then change the menu in schools public or private and then when you coming to school existing new variation the menu's they students bote more for eat and every students alwasys take food in school and the actitudes the students and the teachers is more happy because they star eat food the like for everybody in school, in change the school created one protested for created new food in school more menu existing motre lane for take food and eat and then the students is look more happy and wainting very fine because take more time for eat well."
107,07E1633CC87A,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes to allow students to use their phone in class but also some schools doesn't like students having their cell phones in class or educational purposes.

In addition, students can get distracted while the teacher is talking or just in general but students should use their cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes because if student needs help finding a word, students can use for emergency, and students can use their phones to check on theirs grades and any missing work.

First, If students need help finding a word, they can look it up on their phones for example, if the word is apple they can look for the definition and use it for resource.

Second, if the student has an emergency therefor, students can contact their parents if the student isn't feeling well or any problems.

Third, students can check on their phones to see if they have any missing work or any grades fix furthermore, if students can't remember if they turned in their papers, they can check on their phones to see if they turned it in. If the student has a F in the class and if students can't use their phone how will they know what grade they have in that class.

In conclusion, I strongly agree to let student have their cell phones in the classroom because of those reasons. Some other students likes listening to music while they work because they can focus better. The students also can prove that they use their cell phones wisely in class.     "
1081,52D0FED6AF38,"Many people debate about this topic since one of the most known scientist said this statement. A lot of people agree and disagree, and from my knowledge, I agree. Imagination is something that everyone has, not everyone has knowledge. Imagination can lead you to imagine things that other people haven't. This is how many scientist got fame by just thinking about new things.

With imagination you can think about a new type of computers, new math formula, or a new type of material that hasn't been invented yet. Many scientist invented new stuff from just thinking about new formulas or experiments that they could to make something new. There's also things like the periodic table, that the scientist who made it spent days and nights just thinking about new substances and materials, when he went to sleep, he dreamed about new substances that later on got on the periodic table.

Thinking about things in places you shouldn't, like school, could either lead you success and give new things to do and study, or low grades because you weren't paying attention, must of the times is the second option. Thinking is most of the times in math, where you have to do a hard equation and think and do a lot of work. If you like to think, that might be your favorite class and you will get good grades. Getting good grades in math is really good, it means that you have a good memory and you can easily learn new things (it usually means that when you can do a lot of problems without having difficulty).

Imaginations can also give you knowledge, when you think, it opens a new whole world of ideas. You can basically do anything you want. You can basically experiment with anything you want, but you might not get the right answer or the thing you expected but you will also learn why. These type of things can also help you to learn why something did or did not work as planned. It also helps you think about stuff that you could or not do in real life, for example doing something that is ilegal and you shouldn't do. It also helps when you think a rule or a law is dumb, you can thing what could happen if you did it, that could work to see why it's a rule.

Imagination is something that everyone has and everyone can use without a limit. Using it can lead to a lot of stuff, such as success and making new things. Knowledge is something not everyone has and not everyone can use, imagining can lead you to learn new stuff without doing much effort or risking to do it in real life and might get in trouble by doing it."

What happened if thers a event but you have to clean up for community service? Is right to do the right thing. Community service is important to the community because in the future the community change and everybody is happy. Some people doesn't wannabe help or they have other things to do. Is the same thing as school. Some students is in Community service.

First reason, that Community service is important because the mayor of the city will be proud. Some people say ''What a mess is here!''. The community service is come for help. When you left trash then later it will smell bad. Some people hated when this happened. Please don't leave thrash on the floor put it in the trash can.

Second reason is that when there's a event the people who work there have to clean up before the event starts. Some people think that takes too much time away but no. They just want to help people and the community. In school is the same thing friends doesn't want to help and some to.

Last reason is that there's too much to clean up and during the night. Janitors need to clean up during the night because when the next day comes it will be clean and neat. Some people clean up their stuff alone and sometimes together.

Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize.

Who would've known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days?

Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. That's why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Yes they'll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but you'll get use to it as time continues.

Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to there customers? and last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items. All of this would stink if we wouldn't have such great technology in our hands.                                         "
3338,E738D8E24101,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Students should be active in all the school year even for the intire life. I belive that be active help us to increase our skills and the practice made an expert. In the other hand,others belive that be inactive can result good and help them to don't become tired and old to fast. The people do more accomplish if they are always doing somenthing,students who practice sports can become better they have more resistence,and Moreover,Stay active can help us to be more profecional even in a jod. Exercise help our body to stay healthy.

However not everyone is agree with this position. Some people belive that stay inactive is more accomplish because doing the same thing can become bored,Doing nothing doesn't help us to progress and be success for the intire life,The students who don't practice any sport or are not involve in any school program have more time to study and rest their maind that can result good in their final grade.

Forthemore,be active help us to increase our skils and the practice made an expert because if we are always active in what the teacher tell us to do at school,we can increase and be more and more faster the next time,that also can help to find a job because every boss want a good worker, and also that give us a good reffert because anyone can say good things about us depending on what we have done do far at schools,even outside the school like comunity service.

In addition,students who practice sports can become better because they can have more resistence and their body is healthy,also they can be hard worker in the future because their body is already made to bear that,practice sports at the schools is good because students recive credits for that and a reward if they win,that can give us new experiences and fun time also makes new friends who like to be active like me and others students around the country and around the world.

Moreover,sleep good and having the hours to rest help us to be active the next day don't feeling tired and sleepy because the students have to wake up early on the morning and gives all what they have at the school,everyone want to be a good student and pass the tests and everything,also be active depend in how much energy we have thats way we have to eat on the morning to have energy and be active the all day.

Finally,it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something because we can get our goals working hard,students making goals to the end of the school year, stay active help to makes goals and get what we want to the of the school year,stay active can include be participate en class,colarate in a school proyet,sport team,drama,school announcement and everything that involve school learning,after Hig School or in the collage,be active helps to go to the collage because we can get a Beca for our work in Hing School.

Overall,stay active is more accomplish and help us to the entire life and make us better now and in the future because if we do the things rigth,we can earn more money when we start to work,stay active not only benifit us also the people around us because they can see us that we never stay in one place thats mean we are not conformist a person or student who want to overcome their self. Students should be give all they have by participating and be active. but be active deppend in everyone be active is not by force is how they want to be."
2917,D25F59B6DC95,"Although some people say that first impressions are impossible to change, nevertheless I think that first impressions can sometimes change because you get to know thaht person, how they act, and that can sometimes change what you think about them or they can sometimes not change.

In order to think about something about that person you have to get to know them because if you don't know them you won't know why are they being like that. You can't just think something wrong just cause of how they dress. If you get to know that person you will know what they been through. Sometimes people judge just to judge or to think someting that is not true about them. For example when I first saw my guy friend I thought he was wierd, but when I started to talk to him he was totally diffrent from the guy i thought he would be, he is fun to talk with and hang out with.

Some peoples' first impression about someone they are not good. Some people jugde you in how you act and how they dress. The way people act is how sometimes how they are actually are. But I mean if you talk to that person they might be fun to hang out with 24/7. Talk to that person then you will see how first impressions are not always what you think they are.

If you talk to the person and you get to know them, then you will see how first impression about someone are not always true about them. First impressions could change if you decide to talk to them. Don't juge someone if you don't know them

Always be nice to people even if you don't know them. You don't know what they been throught, in oder for you to judge them. It's true sometimes first impressions are not always going to change. But first impressions are not always true about someone be careful on what you say or do to them."
1593,7982F5F494E2,"In my opinion setting a good example is the only way to influence people you're a good person. many people wont believe you're a good person just because you say you are. However, if you show them by how you act like for an example: you don't bother anyone, you show where a location is or try to, being polite, patience, showing manners, etc.

they will find you setting a good example or showing good behavior. Not only setting a good example can make people say you're a good person , it can also lead to ""good karma"".

Lets say you have a younger sibling, and they want to be like you , you can be smart , responsible,and a good behaving person, show them a good example so they can be as successful as you. same goes to people dont show them a bad behavior or example, thats not gonna get you anywhere, that'll only make people not like you and assume different things. Another thing is always set good example when you're out in public with a family member, because if you dont people will not like that and have your family at fault.

in conclusion to all this if you show good behavior or set a good example by showing it , It will not only make people assume you're a good person it will also influence young ones to do the same.     "
487,25130AAA9552,"Do you think that students are allow to visit workplace. If companies allow students the would be expert at there job if the visit the workplace the would know where the think are and if you are the employer you would be firmer with the new worker at the job.

I would like to work at a companies because there you can work with more than one worker and have your owed offiest and you can be doing work with you worker and get help if you need help from your workers and If you allow me to visit it can be change in your companies.

Allow students to visit can help your partnerships with schools and students minet work at your companies or organizations companies can get a lot of help from students if the allow them to visit some companies need a good idea if you lant students visit the can give some good ideas for your companies and you organizations.

Why I chose working for a companies is because I like to talk with other workers and have fun while I am in work and I like working with others so this the best job and the best chose for my companies to chose me.

student like to be with there friends at work so this is the best job for the student that like to be with the friends at work and have fun if you have a group of friends this minet be the best job for all of you.

Local workplace is for you if you don't have group of friends

I chose this job for this reies. Companies should allow students to visit the companies or the job you with to work for all the jobs sould allow students to visit it. but some of the job are dgerast.

609,2E3FC44757FB,"Do you ever help somebody out and good things come out of it? or helped out a young person and they see you as a role model? well guess what!

There this program called ""Older students assist younger students"" .

What I think on this program that pairs older students with younger students is important because the students that are older already learned about what the younger students are learning about so they give out ways on how they learned it and show it to the younger students . Another reason why this program that older students assist younger students is good and important because a older student can also get more information from what a younger student already knows and not a older student.

This program is not only good and important but it also helps out any age ,in other words this program can help anybody out when help is needed. You can help out anybody and they will see you as there role model for showing them the good things you should do and what comes out of it from the good descion you did. Having a negative mind wont get you nowhere in live so that is why older students help around younger students because the younger students are young and still dont know what they plan on being in the future. Not everybody has a role model because they have there own plans in the future or because they just dont want to do what everybody does as a living but when they get some help from a older person who already knows what they are doing the younger students start to wake up notice that you got to do what you got to do in order for you to get where you want to be.

The only thing is that only some school's have this program and it sucks becuase there is some people who want help or need assist from someone who has already been what there going thru so if you have this program use it wisley and dont take it for granted. everybody in the world can get the help they need so they can be someone in life so that is why they have that program were older students help out younger students so the younger students wont make error mistakes in there future life.

What would you do if you had this program and how would you use it in the furture of yours? I 100% this prgoram is a good idea.     "
1183,5BF7AAC78AB5,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Just like saying ""if you want to know everything you got to not know anything first."" , ""if you want to be rich you got to be poor first."" , ""You got to learn how to walk before you run.""

Every people that are smart, rich and well-know there are all born without any of that just like every single one of us, no one is perfect. We all have something that we are good at and something that we are bad at.

The way to successful is not hard to get there. Do what you are good at. Make sure you are enjoin what you are doing. Just like this one man that I forgot his name said ""get a job that you are enjoin doing it, a job that you have fun doing it and you will jump out of the bed in morning.""

You are who you are right now because of all the mistake you make in the pass. ""success consists of going from failure to failure."" you lean from your mistake. If you never do anything wrong that mean you never do anything at all. All the mistake you make you better because you lean from it. You can also lean form another people mistake too. It's one of the reason why most of thing in world got better.

Soccer is the sport that I like. I'm not that good at it but not that bad either. When I first start playing I don't know a lot about it so I keep playing unit I know a little bit more about it. Then I start playing with the pro player because I know that I'm gonna make a lot of mistake and all those mistake gonna help lean how to play and how to get better and it does. I make a lot of mistake I still do but I like to take a hit sometime it make me stronger. you know what they say ""what doesn't kill you make you stronger."" so I keep trying and trying hope that I can make that to be my job. Mistake dose help you it may be a big one something or a small one but all the mistake help you. I was really bad at soccer once but now I petty good at it.

All of this should explain why Churchill said that""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Mistake is a part of you it's a part of everything but it's not all way bad.

1982,9615F113FAA1,"My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with my principal because you cant force anyone, they can do whatever they want, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity.

Forcing someone is not good because you cant tell someone do things that they couldnt do. Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.

The students should decide what they should do, not the principal because students should get their own opinions. Letting the principal decide the students what to do, make me feel not very good because it make me feel like he is telling me what to do and i dont like that.

Some other people are not good at doing sports or working the year. Some people are different from others. Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something.

I disagree what is the principal is saying because they cant forcing any the student, the students should decided they own, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity. The students should be able to choose what they ever want.     "
3744,F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future.

It's true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person.

Secondly, It's also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made.

On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life.

Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life.                "
3683,F6C88F801A8A,"I would have to disagree to this statements. Letting be controlled by the world

(people)

it's not a good idea. There is so many things to accomplish, by not being controlled by other people. We can so many things without people controlling us, we can succeed our life. We can actually be someone though our hard work and deduction.

being us:

just being who you are would be the best and great choice to do. You would think properly with correct knowledge, just by doing that, You would accomplish so many things in life without people going agents you. NOT being you or being someone you really not are, is not a good idea.

Don't let them control you:

letting people control who you are, isn't a good thing. Many people think is a good thing because they can fame or attention, Its like having a double life, 1: living the regular life, being who you really are, 2: Being out in public pretending to be someone when your not. You won't accomplish the things you want to do when your not yourself. You will feel important when the world wants you be someone. Be yourself and accomplish the things you want to do and you will improve your skills and achivments. They will just control your life and they won't help you on the long run. No one can control someones life who they want them to be.

being us, not them:

We need let people do what they want we shouldn't be controlling their life. Everyone should chose there who they want to be and what to do. Not everyone should be controlling them. Not everyone are they same, they are different from others. They don't know their weaknesses to be telling them to be.

We shouldn't be controlling other people what to become. Many people do it for the fame and attention but they are the most unsuscceful people. They dont achieve things they go by there fame and people. We should be us and not be someone we cant be. They end up being embarrassed."
1559,77A31D0A07A8,"Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow "". Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in .

Firstly,people learn new things everyday. when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. now if I tell you can speak english good you will not believe it. you do need to move beyound what have mastered in to grow .Because you can mastered in math but you don't know the whole thing about stuff. so I think the more person do what they are mastered in the more they grow. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. Besides this ,people grow every single day.

However, Some people grow single day. because the more you study for the things you have mastered the more you grow. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids,

teach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. you learn about it to take you a different levels. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke.

Sometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. like how you get to study more when you take IB course but not just they bring new things to help do you work on time and stuff.

In summary,I think that the qoute Emerson wrote was not right because how can someone mastered some that can not help them grow .people thing will help them grow in future .I think people who are hopping jobs to jobs or whatever they are doing is bad , because doen't help you to grow .because you get enouch time them you swtiches."
2611,C1BED9EF3630,"Most high school students prefer to do their regular four years of high school and enter college after they graduate and apply for college during their senior year to get help from their counselors and school teachers. Graduate early could be difficult for adolescents because not everyone have the same way of learning and some can be more faster than others. School districts should let the students decide whether they want to graduate early or not and give them more freedom to do want they want about their future. students that do their traditional four years do not follow this plan because it can bring pressure and anxiety, they would have to do extra work and,

they are able to pick elective classes.

Every student know that it is very important to pass their classes and be aware of how many credits they have in order to graduate. If you want to graduate early this issue can be dangerous because it can bring anxiety and pressure to adolescents during their high school years. Graduate early can make your life difficult because anxiety combine with pressure frequently gives mental problems. Some parents are constantly checking grades and that can be very frustrated towards their kids and hard to handle because they are often being told to do well and if they don't their guardians limit important items from them and usually control their life because they don't get good grades.

The fear to be behind and getting low grades are always present in students but the worries should be less for those that do not graduate early. teachers recommend to the students to take extra courses during the summer or evenings to advanced in their classes. on account of doing four years of high school you dont need to do extra work. In spite of that you still need to do your assignments at the same time but being not in a rush like the others. Every person should be responsible for their own work even if they have to do it later on it doesn't matter.

The school provides the students the opportunity to take a new subject that they haven't took before. by given them the chance to every student to choose elective courses unfortunately for those that graduate early don't have the same option because it is a waste of time receiving a class you don't need; otherwise you can take take as many as you want to challenge yourself and become better at any new topic you want to learn.

In conclusion it is a better idea if students do their traditional four years of high school. In case they need help from their teachers and schools they can get support from both. Anxiety and pressure are serious problems that any student have to pass through because it distract them from their learning and the attention of the students is also taken away. Extra time should not be used to do extra work because the kids need have to do their assignments and barely have time to do extra courses.

Everyone should have elective classes because is a good way to learn new activities in school and get distracted from your most important classes that you are taking during the school year.     "
2728,C8D7D7FA3008,"I think that something positive and negative for this reasons if you have a work and work just 4 days for ten hours you don't have sufficient money for pay your bills, have a trip with your family or other things but you have more time for pass time with your family,to relax,watch the tv, stay in home with your wife and children and this is good because sometime you can't share with your family and friends so i think that this is a good proposal.

I think that this is an good idea because if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours the benefits are you have more time for study and complete all your work three days to relax in home and do your homework or get a jod and work for three days all this is a benefits.

I believe that with this proposal don't have disadvantages because support all students for more opportunity in the school and be a better student.

In my conclution this is a big opportunity for better jods and better school but we have to know that all pruposal have benefits and disasvantages for everyone."
1138,584A4BB1E954,"Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? I think students should designed. students can do this well.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they can't do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

In conclusion, I think the students need to choose their projects because if they choose their projects they like the summer projects and they really want to complete their projects in the summer vacation and they have good ideas about the projects."

Do you think imagination is more important then knowledge? I agree with Albert Einstein because if people focus on getting more knowledge people won't be trying to solve the problem with imagination. When more people come in to the USA then people or trying to stop it and not focusing on the students and staff that want help when in need. When people do their taxes the money goes to helping solve the problem so people should do their taxes to help solve the problem faster so kids can have go learning environment. The more the President wants to work on trying to get a imagination law to be made he should be focusing on the over things he ran for president not just one thing for years. The President should work on helping the people in need like sick people or the homeless and trying to help the homeless buy or get a small home to be safe in in so they can survive in the cold days and be clean and healthy. I mean having knowledge is good to get the job you wanted since you were a kid but i say it's better to work on imagination while working on helping people in need. I'm just saying that the President should work on lots of things and when working on big problem too. What do you think of when people say is imagination more impotent then knowledge? Think of it and the ask your self if you want to help out or not."

Did you ever try to create a new substance from chemicals? Will this is how people in the lab can do it. First, they measure the liquid and check the temperature. Then, they add another substance to react with the liquid and measure it again and check the temperature. Lastly, the liquid will precipitate or create a gas form. To conclude, this is how people create a new substance and chemicals in the lab.

You can't do a experiment without learning more about chemicals and their reactions. People who want to study about science take science class or a course to learn more about substance and chemicals. Also, people in the lab learn about chemical compounds and their specific names. To conclude, this is how people studying or learning about chemicals and substances.

You can't have fun without trying some new experiment in the lab. If you try a new experiment in the lab you can understand more better about science.

Because they always have their noses in their phones and they never take time to go outside. Very few peoplw know what it's like to actually spend time outside.

Sports are another example, not only are they fun, but they are alsp helping you stay healthy especially if you play almost everyday. If you think about it every sport requires you to run or to keep moving. Sports can also be something you do after dealing with a lot of stress or work. They were shown to be a good for both your body and your mind.

Families also become closer when they spend time together with no sort of technolgy that can distract them. I think now in days families aren't as close as they used to be because we spend to much time on our phones and not so much on the people who care about us.

Technology has advanced a lot in these past years and it is fine that people want to explore new things. But we shouldn't get lost in it and forget that there are other things waiting to be discovered beyond a tiny screen. Activities like sports bring you better things than a tiny screen can."

1058,50E361CD561E,"Working in a group is more benefitial than working alone because there are so many diferent ideas that the group members can have to achieve a great work.

The majority of students that I have asked about it say that working in group has been more succesful for them because in fact it is way faster,you get to share your ideas and support others. Many times that I have worked on something by my self I always wonder about many things or opinions about my work and it is hard for me to check if it is good or what would people think about my work.

It is also benefitial for teachers because students will have less questions for them,so teachers can use that time for grading or other things while the students are working in group. I have seen some teachers having a hard time grading and explaining at the same time because every single student is working by their own.

Teachers must have their students working in a group than alone because as I see it is more benefitial and better,this will have students to come up with better work and they also get to interact with diferent people and learn from them."

1463,7101C080C12C,"What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.

Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.

How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if it's not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people.

Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.

So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If it's happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it.    "

When the students find a problem they will need teacher for help them to turn the work before the deadline.

However, if there are no teacher for helps them, then students will can not turn the work on time and students will get bad grade.

As result, one student is takes class online, in one day he find problem that he can not understand it and there are no teacher for help him, then he get bad grade because he can not understand the problem to turn the work on time.

937,477B00F899E2,"Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning

Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer.

Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests.

Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates.

In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions."
993,4C0ECF107EC5,"Yes, is a good idea because if high school selected to guide them towerd a specific career, because we can see how difficult be, or if be easy to go the college, however, is good idea, because you can see if you are soure of want the specific career, or you want change for other career, because some time the career you want is be difficult and you can`t do it. So we can have ideas how the college be, so if the high school put the this opcion be great, because when you finished the high school you really have a idea what you want to pick for the college or what career you want to take.

Some time was make difficult to pick the class or the career because din`t have ideas, so with this opcion is be great because we have ideas how take a college class.

When you are not soure what you want to pick for you career, this is a good opcion, because be help you to know how college is.

3405,EA03135D3C88,"Student-designed

Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder.

The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math.

Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations.

The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do.

In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents. "
2862,CFD0D13D3180,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill got the concept that ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."". Many people failed and successed in life. Some people learn by their own mistake, fail is part of growth. Others, feel like to fail is being a loser and cannot admit their defeat from a battle. In other words, they have no modesty. Success consist to not give up on your goals, to not leave your dreams from a simple mistake; to not describe yourself as a coward.

Many people failed during their career, even the most professionals, but they kept trying. It may be that to fail bring some issues of closed minds, fears, etc. For example, There is a doctor that knows the hard work to finally done with college plus to achieve what you'd love to be. This doctor studied for 7 years, this is a huge and long way of his career. As you know doctors never stop studying because the technology changes every year. Therefore, the start is not easy as, others, thought because the first stage of college, it may be the hardest stage than the others. Some people fail the first test, or the first semester so they prefer to abandon their studies than do better in college. This doctor have failed on the way of his career, but prefered to ask for help instance of giving up. The importance of failing is to learn and the importance of learning is to success in life. Above this, a 15 years old guy used to fail in High School and this student was down-hearted, but the family supported him without criticize him. It was not easy because some are not smart enough, but this 15 years old guy put a little bit of effort and now he is a doctor in Spain.

Failure to faliure is the key of succes. Besides, Failure gives you more knowledge of your mistake and opens your mind to discover news to things to learn. For example, a cook is trying to do new dishes from differents cultures. Now, the cook wants to try peruvian dishes because the gastronomy of Peru is one of the most populars in the world. Also, this would be a benefit because will gain more money. By trying these new dishes, the cook fails because most of the customer did not like the food plus received many critical comments. As many cooks receives many critical comments, they decide to abandon the kitchen and do something different. This cook enjoyed when he commited a few or big error; to do better next time. Learned to do better the new peruvian dishes, listened to the rest of people and finally, succeded in the kitchen.

Some feel ashamed to fail, they usually compare themselves to others because life is a competition and this may bring issues of insecurity. That is one of the biggest problems that many people have in these days. If there are 2 lawyers that wants to face a case of an innocent and important person, who is involved, in a serious problem. The best lawyer would defend the case and will be recognized as one of the best, would get inmmediatly many jobs for being recommended. On the other hand, if a lawyer fails a case would not get inmmediatly many cases often. Therefore, the lawyer knows that to fail have a positive side of learning, gives you more skills of how to face any case.

In conclusion, as Churchill said that to fail is the start to success. As many people fail, they learn. Some people are not smart enough, but they put effort of what they want to do. Even though they fail, they keep trying because is the ability of their knowledge. People that are already professionals, they make mistakes and enjoy of their mistakes because they learn more of their speciality. Finally, even if you want to be the best of something, do not feel ashamed because life is a competition and do not closed your mind of making a few mistake. "

Now lets talk about fire drills the best thing to do is not panic, you just got to act fast and think smart your main priorty is for you and your friends to get out the building safely. follow your teacher during the fire, cover your mouth with your shirt or sweater dont inhale the smoke thats how you pass out from the smoke.

I agree with people who make their own decisions because it will build up confidence,higher chance of accomplishments, and it helps them understand from their mistakes.

My first reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, it will build up confidence. Having confidence is a big thing to many people because thay can do many thing in life and will not fail. Having confidence can help people in many places.

My second reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, you will have higher chance of accomplishments. If you make your own decisions you can have many accomplishments,because if you make good decisions in life you have more chance of success. You can accomplish anything you want if you make your own decisions,because making your own decisions can be anything you want and you dont have to follow anyone.

My third reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, It will help people understand from their mistakes. People who make mistakes from thier own decisions will have a higher chance to understand and will not do it again. On the other hand,Many people seek guidnace from experts so they dont have to make thier own decisions;However,making your own decisions will help you be a better person and it will help you be you.

In conclusion,Making your own decisions in life is a good thing for many of us. Making your own decisions will make you a better person and you don't have to follow others. Many people could seek guidance from experts If they can't make thier own decision. These are all of my reasons why I think people should make their own decisions."

3206,E0BFF1488787,"I disagree with schools having a program with older and youngest students

Many younger students does not know anything about program

Many older students are smartest then the youngest students

Many youngest students are not smarter than the older students

1. One day when i was on elementary school i was in 4th grade and my teacher put me on a program with older people and the older people were smarter than me and i din't knew anything and the older people knew everything i was the only one who dint knew any thing.

2. The other day i was on middle school and i was on a program and i was on 8th grade and i was in a program with youngest students the youngest students werent smartest than the older student and there was a kid who dint knew anything on the program.

3.

522,27E725D251A8,"Do you think people aways succeed without any challenge in their life?.

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right.

Some people sometimes decide to isolate because they cannot handle the pressure of this world being a human is not easy becasue sometimes you just feel that the comments that the people make about you are real, but everybody should be strong and be themselves,because we as humans we can do anything that we want to achieve our goals and never pay attention to those comments because we can show them who we really are.

Firts, desire a lot of people when they see someone that is doing great on their life, sometimes people don't like it, others ones start thinking on doing it becuase they know the this man/woman are there because they work hard, in this world nothing is easy to have unless you work so hard to get it but never try to be soemeone else and is not necessary to do things that you don't like because you are trying to be like one else not do the mistake the most important thing is that you are going to show to those people that did not believe in you that nothing is impossible even when this world if full of envy.

Second, confidence now people around the world what they see in a person is their appearance,clothes, shoes, etc, now people are like trying to be something that they are not to try to fit in this fake world, but you know there is where you realize that is wrong to be honest things don't matter what really matter is who you are you and what can you offer to this world that is trying to kick you out, but you start getting confidence and that is a big challenge to try be youse around people that don't see life the way you see it.

Third, success as the world give you hard times you start to be strong, sometimes you have to go through things ` that you start to think about giving up, but you quickly think that you are wrong that you are going to make it even if is impossible like the author says ""To be you yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplsiments.""

Some people have lose their confidence becuase they are trying to be something that they're not, people think that being fake is the best way to fit, i don't think like them i think that you should you be who you really are.

In a world where you have to fight to be yourself and don't get lost in the fantasy that the world offers you that is the greastest accomplisment. A lot of people might argue that is not true, but they are all wrong because people always can be themselve if they wants even is the world if full of lies is their responsability to make real their dreams.

In the future i will try to tell the people that nothing is imposible, to not be afraid of who they are that each person if different in that is what make us special.

In this life you just have to be youlself enjoy every moment because after you get old you will regret everything that you didn't because you just were to be busy trying to be someone you are not.

To conclude, life sometimes gives you the opportunity to discover who you really are and know what is what you wants."
1861,8C34447FF21C,"I have heard that many people gets bully by others people sometimes, and which is I don't understand, why this it happens probably for the color of you're skin and we all are the same just the color of the skin is different. Or can be other reason why they bully other people, which is people who gets bully they could kill themselves about getting bullied by other ones and thats a bad situation.

But those bad people they keep on bulling they don't stop until something happens and I ask my self why? this happens sometimes, probably its because we are different than they are or they feel more stronger than other ones or can be any other reason probably they are rich they have more money than other people, probably thats why bulling someone is not nice it could cause bad things to you.

And I understand that its hard for those people who are suffering about bulling, and its hard to support all that when you get bullied for someone, when you bullied i thin k is not for some reason and its horrible for those people who gets bullied by someone, I think thats something that those people who are bulling they should stop bulling those poor people.

What should we do about bulling collaborate to stop we should stop because, it can cause bad situation to those people who are bulling other they can go to jail for the reason they make fun of others, why they can go jail because those poor people who are getting bullied they could kill themselves and thats why they can go to jail its a bad thing thats what can happen to them if they don't stop bulling           "
3069,DA7C756EEA38,"Do you think imagination is more important than knowledge? I think imagine is better than knowledge because you can imagine a lot of thing. Imagination is more important than knowledge because you get to picture or about what you want to do when you grow up or something you want to do with your life or your friends. You can imagine all that by thinking about it or just doing it when you want to.

I remember one time my mom ask what I want to do or to be when i grow up I said a soccer player and I said i imagine me playing with one of the best player playing with me mom said but you have to practice very hard to even make it on the team and I said you going to see on your television very soon. Knowledge is not important than imagination because knowledge you have to learn about it to make sure you no what you talking about but imagination is when you imagine something in your life that you know is going to happen in your life one day is as fun as everything in the world that can make you happy in life or a point of your life.

So ne time i was playing soccer with my friends outside in the rain and I imagined myself making it on the school team I was very happy when I made on the school team. So the next day i went to school and they were calling out the people who made it on the school team, So I head the call my name and I was very happy because they called my name out and it is because I imagined myself making it on the school team and every worked out good, So I was the best soccer player in middle school, now i can not wait when I am famous and ever body know my name.

In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge and you can imagine what you going to do before it even happens.

1083,52F0677ACD21,"It is possible to change your first impression, because not everything is how you might see at first, lots of things are different then you may think they are, so many people think that lots of things are bad, just because that is what came to their mind when they first saw it.

We should never judge someone or some things on our first impression because we could be wrong, and miss judge things that we think is not right, we even have different first impressions on other people, without even knowing about them, or what kind of person he or she is. You could be wrong on some of the things that you may seee because it maight not be how and what we see,and you could have miss. In 10th grade I miss judged one of my friend because I thought he wasn't the person I wanna talk to. Even tho I had some classes with him I would not talk or be around him, because my impression was that he does not shows respect not only to other students but teachers too , therefor I won't talk to him so he would never know me and won't be mean to me.

However, Later I realize that he was one of my best friend and the nicest person I had ever met, who I can trust and hang out with. Even tho, you may think that you can not change your first impression if you think about it, it might change your first impression.       "
1403,6C045F130B28,"Technology in today's life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on people's life. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.

Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self.

But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.

At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects.             "
2010,9801CF414927,"I believe that changing the school lunch menu would be a good idea, there are reasons why the change of the lunch would be good idea; It can help students who are sick, It can help the students who play in a sport team, it can help those student who abuse eating at home.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes.

Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesn't matter what kind of disease can be,

it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu.

In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will."
1244,602E786321EA,"Others may think otherwise, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Take Elon Musk for an example, he started out as a young kid who learned how to use computers but he did not stop there. Once he mastered computers he set higher and higher goals to master untill he ended up to be one of the richest man alive. I myself started with just drawing and graphic designing little art projects. then I started putting higher goals to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobe's products and doing commisions. Leonardo DaVinci was not just an artist. He was an inventer. he invented numerous of things, he had multiple skills. thats because he mastered all of these skills he set higher goals for himself and he achived them.

First examaple Elon musk. He was a bright kid. He leared how to use computers at a young age and mastered how to use them. Elon Musk did not stop there, He set higher goals to master. Elon Musk Drasticly Grew alot over the years. For and example he invented PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla. Now he is one of the riches man alive.

Second example is myself. I started out with just Drawing and graphic Designing a simple banner for my YouTube channel. then I started setting higher goals for myself to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobe's products. Doing commisions for YouTuber's and Esports teams and making money.

Last example is Leonardo DaVinci, Leoanrdo DaVinci was no ordinary artist from the Renissance Age. What made Leonardo DaVinci Stand out was that he was not a quitter infact he loved setting higher goals for himself to master. He loved growing, learning and mastering new things. Leoanrdo was not only an artist he was an inventor a scientist and that why he grew up to be one of many people biggest inspiration infact he is my inspiration. Leoanrdo was not a quiter and that's what made him grow up to be special and successful if life.

Now other may say that you dont need set higher goals to grow. But I think quite the opposite becuase if you don't set higher goals for yourself then learning new things and growing new skills would most likely be impossible unless you try to surpass your last achivement therfore you won't be able to grow and be as successful in life.

145,0B00BC4CBABC,"So if it has come to a point that you don't have to make decisions on your own, even if you have what ever it takes to rule the whole nations, what would you do?. Nothing?, or run away to where you can make your own plans?. NO!. I strongly agree that, people should make decisions on their own.

Making decisions on your own can make you stronger. For example, when i realize i was failing my science class. I took a decision on my own by telling myself; i need to pass this class for the rest of the quarter. And i'm doing great now because i put in my mind with all my strength, focused and i'm doing more than amazing. If someone gave me that decision to pass that class, i wouldn't be able to, because i haven't made my mind up to that and maybe i don't or not into that class.

Secondly, you know your challenges to your decision that you make by yourself. For instance, i tried out this year for the school soccer team. I knew it was only 2 option: either you make it or you get cut out. So, me knowing that made me work harder when i get on the pitch. I get pains in my legs when i get home but i also know that, i have do it again tomorrow so it makes me do extra work home so that i won't be ill but be in shape for the next day.

Lastly, sometimes we make a bad decision which help us learn. To prove this, 3 weeks ago, my mom ask me to clean her bathroom for her, also i had a club to attend. Because i knew going to club will be fun and meeting new friends so, i told my mom i'm going to the club instead, and i will clean the bathroom the next day. And so, i went to the party. A friend of mine was a drug dealer: i didn't know, and he was wanted my the police. He came to the same party and we were sharing the same table. We were drinking, chatting, eating and having fun. All of a sudden, we saw 3 police men that came to arrest my friend but because we were sitting together; we were all arrested because him. If i choose to clean the bathroom this would have not happen to me. The lesson that i learned is that; i don't need to follow my decision every time, and also know who hang around with.

As a results, making decisions on our own can make us strong and focused, know our challenges and also learn. If all this ability only get reviewed when we make decisions on our own, why should we seek for guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?. Let's people take decisions and do stuff with their own mind set."
393,1DDC2D1DB4EE,"Dear principal, I'm writting this letter to let you know my opinion on the idea of change the school lunch menu into a new healthier menu. I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier.

Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily.

By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that they're had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they don't like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy.

Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food.

In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier. Those are the reasons that make me think this way, I hope this letter could help you decide that implement this plan is a good idea to change the school for better. Thank you for you time, dear principal."
3686,F70288B24094,"No i do not think that we should add one hour and a half to school. I think it is bad anough that we have to stay for about 7 hours i have a lot of reasons why i think they should not add an hour to school. One of the reasons i would not want them to add an hour to school is because if they add an hour to school they would have to add class to the chool to. but one of the main resons that i would not want another hour at school is becuase kids just want to go home and adding an hour would just get kids and parents mad for there kids getting home late.

For example if it was day light savings time it would be very dark once every one to go home. Or if a teacher staff memeber or student plays a sport they would be late or unbkle to go for the late releas at the school. In addition if there where to be a lockdown at that hour and a half that the school bored had added the parents of the students might want to sue the school bored for putting there children in danger at the time they added to the day. Another example is if ther is a fire they could get sued for the same thing that is why i feel like the school bored should not add an hour and a half to the school day."
2901,D1B607165DAB,"In the past, I was scared to go beyond at what I was good at which was soccer. I agree with what the quote which said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" because if you stay at the limits that you were already at before you'll never know what other things you can accomplish and we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself

"" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that your not improving your life.

I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you stay at the limits that you were already at before you'll never know what other things you can accomplish. To begin with, you want to to go beyond standards because maybe you'll learn something new ,or you will encounter an ability that you probably thought you didn't have. For example, when I was in freshmen in high school I decided to start playing and training for soccer and I tried out for the junior varsity soccer team I told myself I am gong to play at my standards, so the coach saw me playing nervous and he asked me "" why are you playing nervous"" I said, "" I am trying to play at my standards"" the coach said, ""Just relax."" after that I found out I had so many abilities to become a great soccer player. In addition, it's not bad at all trying to go beyond your limits because the more you go beyond your limits the more you'll want to keep doing it. Also, there's that one saying "" Go Big Or Go Home"" one of the sayings I live up to. Finally, you always want to think big for the most part of your life. Also you always want to try new things in life that's the only way you'll grow in life.

I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself

"" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that, your not improving your life. To begin with, life is short to be honest you and I am still trying to do things to improve my life. For example, I am 17 year old in highschool, I listen to with one song called ""the nights"" by Avici. He talks about his dad telling him you always want to experience new things and try to live life to the fullest, so right there I am just saying to myself don't maintain the same life, try to experience new things in life period. In addition, don't have a simple life try to be creative in this life. Also, you might not be ready to go beyond your limits, but just know that one day you might be willing to give it a try. Finally, there was one time I was scared to go on big roller coasters. I could only go on medium roller coaster because they didn't look scary at all, but there was moment on the day I told myself I getting a big roller coaster so I did and it made feel good about myself because I tried something new.

Also some people may say that, you will grow even though you don't try anything new in your life. In addition, some people probably don't even care about life. Finally, others might have their own opinions about this topic. Also some wouldn't really care about. In conclusion, in the future I will try to improve my limits and think big.                            "

3033,D92452B93539,"Reasons why the school board not add one hour and a half more for each day. i have a few reasons why we shouldn't do that. first reason homework. Second reason the time after school and third reason why is teachers. these are going to be my reason why in this passage.

First reason is homework if we have more time in the school day how would students have time to do their homework. If we had a hour and a half more then teachers shouldn't give homework to students. students shouldn't have more time in school then have homework after school students have have some time to enjoy themselves and still do homework if we have more hours in school students wouldn't have the time to enjoy themselves. If students did their homework after they wouldn't have time to enjoy themselves after because it would be dark outside then they have to go to bed.

Second reason is students having time like i said in the other paragraph students wouldn't have time if we had more hours in school. students wouldn;t do fun after homework after school because by the time you know the sun would go down and it would be too late for anything. go out somewhere, play outside, and hang with friends.

Third reason why is because teachers. teachers would have more work in their hands teachers have a life too they need to get to their families too. and all the work they have to do would them holding longer which would keep longer away from their families too this is is why schools shouldn't have more hours in school     "
1419,6CDE42A3FA9F,"People think sometimes that influencing means you have to be an example for the person, but in my opinion influencing someone could be through anything like : internet, words, a friend and even family. I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said,  Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing.

First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it.

Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the and of day they use it once, and then forget about it.

On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example. In addiction, my mom is someone that consider as an example for me, if she do soemthing wrong it doesn't mean that I am going to do it, too. I think being an example is something good as long as you don't do what they did wrong.

In conclusion, I think there are more ways to influence people. It could be you influencing someone else or someone influcing you."
1187,5C31B4B9B185,"Do you think that the programs of graduate in three year is a good way?

some school need student that they have online classes and they can graduate before than three year for one part the program of graduate in three year is not good, because is more hard, My brother need help for teachers for graduate, and in the school classes he learn more, and he pay many attention to the teacher because he want graduate in three year etc.

some student take this program in summer school, because they want to finish the high school in three year, and go to the college in less time.

The program of graduate in three years is not good because student need help for the teacher, student learn more with teacher help, and they pay a better attention etc.

The program of graduate in three year is good, because you graduate in less time, and you can go in summer school for graduate the next year, but is more hard, more responsibility, and more work etc.

Should the school districts offer this programs? this programs offer many opportunity to graduate in three years, so i think that this is good for student, and they can have more opportunity to graduate in three years. "
1231,5F679622B317,"Shoul we have to make challenging goals in are life?

Every goals that we make in our life is important to do it,even that is not like we thought. Also do our goals can affect are live psychologyly, such as can make us more confindent of ourselves. ''The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short;but setting in our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Setting our aim too high and falling short is more important because we feel better knowing that we did our best and we can discover new things that maybe we never thought to do.

First, we feel better knowing that we did our best to make are goals,even that is not at all like we thought. When I was 11 years old and I used to play soccer, and one of my goal was to win play in a proffesional soccer team and win trophies,even that I did play for a proffesional soccer team I won many trophies. Trying to make real the goals that we used to had when we were young make us to feel proud and confident of ourselves because we never get up, always fough to do it.

Another reason, when we make our goals, even that maybe we just complete tha half of our goals;we discover new things that maybe we did not know that we can made. For example, if my dream was to be a master chef, and I work at place where a cook food to helping homeless. So, I realized that I can make my goal helping other people. When my brother was a kid, his dream was to travel around the world;even that he is pilot and only go to airport, he meet his fiance in his job. Some people may say that complete only the half of our challenging goals make us disappoined of ourselves because we did not complete. However, copmplete a challenging goals make us proud of ourselves because we are people who worked really hard and we discover many things that maybe others will never do.

Overall, we learn more doing challenging goals in our life than doing small goals that maybe everyone can do essaly.

Also,

making challenging goals we realize that we are people who want to be succsesful in our life. In addition, making challenging goals make us in admiralble people because noy every person decide to make big steps in life."
3109,DC2E6750CDEC,"Nowadays we live in a world where everything has to be perfect if you wanna fit into this society, therefore humans have made up an exteriotype of how people are supposed to dress, look, act and live. We all have the right to do whatever we want and be whoever we are unless you want to hurt someone. We are free to do what is better for ourselves without being judge, so why do we let society control us?. People should not be afraid to be who they are and show the world what they are made of. All humans are different, we all come with different shapes, sizes, personalities, skills and that is what makes us beautiful, the power of being ourselves.

Experiences make you grow and morph you into a better person, life makes you realize how bold and smart humans are, in addition to this we all have been raised differently so trying to follow an exteriotype is like letting go the opportunity you have been given by life to find out what you are made of, to find oud your power, your way of doing things and solving problems, and last but not least you are letting go the opportunity to make up your own thoughts just because you are giving people the chance to control your mind and the way you think.

I totally agree with this statement, to be yourself in an environment that is constantly trying to make you something else is one of the best decisions you could make, perhaps just by being yourself you could teach someone else how to improve its personality, or maybe you could show them how to act when it comes to solve an issue, theres is multiple opportunities we miss just by trying to be someone else . All humans have a superpower within their selves that they could share with everyone, therefore, trying to fit in, follow an exteriotype and trying to act the same way the others do is equal to not take advantage of our power wisely.

We are afraid of showing who we are because, to us is more important what they would say and think about it. We care more about their reaction towards us and what we do not realize is that maybe they would like more who we actually are than the person that we are trying to be. Once humans face the truth and notice how valuable and special we are, that will mean that we have gotten the greatest accomplishment in life, which is being ourselves no matter what the others say or ask us to do."
2717,C82037D6072F,"Befits For An Extra Hour of School

85% of students who study more can pass more test. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test.

First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Education is also super important because it is through out life. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important.

Second, students could have better job opportunity. Some students would not like the job they get. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test.

Third, students will be better prepared for test. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more.

In conclusion, I think an extra 30 minutes could hep students get more education. It is also good for some student. It will also help students be better prepared and it could let them lead to success. So I feel like an extra 30 minutes is not that long so some student would also not mine. So it could benefits some student to make them more successful."
1610,7AAE019F70D6,"I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.

For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies

Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.

Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.

Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress. Those were all of my reasons on why the principal shouldn't mame students do a other activity "
757,3A71C888CE45,"Should your school extend the school day for two hours or they should not extend the school day for two hours? If your school extend school day for two hours there are some thing you can't do. You can't play after school games. You can't do your homework. You have less time to work. You going home late. You can't fresh your mind.

Reason one, students who work after school they have moer time on work. For example, if your working time is four o'clock to ten o'clock. If you work regular time you going to make more money. Students need to work becaus they needs to pay the cell phome bills or on gasolin.

Reason two, students who want to play after school game they can play the game. If they don't have time to play after school game they can't fresh there mind. For example, students who live one or two hours away for school they have time to play after school game.

Reason three, students can fresh there mind. Students can't fresh there mind because they are studying more then they need. For example, some time students can't remember what they learn in class, but can do other thinks. Some time student haveing so much fun in the class. Because there mind is so much fresh.

That why school can't extend the school day for two hours. Students can get tired in ten hours of study. Students can't fresh there mind. They can't play after school game. Students who work after school they have less time on work. That why school shouldn't extend the school day for two hours."
3638,F4FC2D64C127,"Inactive Times and Its Benefits

Should people have inactive times in their life? By doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. It is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

Firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. People's body works better when they have time to rest. For example, my mother's friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. His doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. As a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his Neuron System stopped working properly. He stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. The doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. Right after my mother's friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. In sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life.

Secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. When our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. Being busy makes our mind blocked. For example, Generic_Name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. However, Generic_Name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. All she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. Generic_Name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. She tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. Her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. During those two day Generic_Name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. Generic_Name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. Her class won the competition and her party was amazing. In conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas.

Thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. People who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. For example, when I have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice I feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. So what I do is rest for a while to get energy. This make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. Furthermore, in my Psychology class I learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. In my personal experience, I have tested it on my sister and the results were successful. For example, She had to do an Algebra II homework and then, an English homework. So when she took the first twenty five minutes after she finished her first homework she said, she had energy to do the other one. We test it again without having twenty five minutes break. She said she was tired to do the next homework because she did not have energy. In sum, it is better for people to have inactive times because get more energy.

In conclusion, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy.

People can faced catastrophic result as death by not having inactive times and affect our life time. In addition, when people have lazy times they can came up with new ideas to complete different tasks. Finally, when people rest a certain time after an activity they get more energy. Each individual on earth must have an inactive times. "
3213,E103955391AB,"Yeah we all have our own freedom but well that's not always true a lot of people let others control them. So it is said

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment""

Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also it's a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but it's because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that it's better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand .

""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all .

When your individual you mean something to this world because you think about yourself. You set your own goals and accomplish them and you maintian yourself the way you are it's even more better becuase it's the hugest goal anybody should have to not let anybody change you wreck all you have accomplished. To your self you feel like you value your self and it's not bad at all to value yourself because it biulds self confidence within you and that means you have you feet on the ground and yeah your ready to face any obsticale.

No one should define you except you because the world will defenitly try to change you but if you don't aceppt it won't happen like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" whom we have someone to look up to and understand that to be inividual is okay."
2315,AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that they're more successful than you. That's exactly why you shouldn't trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but don't put your 100% trust in them because it's always that one person that you wouldn't expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldn't let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, don't to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that that's you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself.

You shouldn't be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone they're, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person they're with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they can't accept who you are? Shouldn't you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how they're acting towards you. That's why I don't let people influence me in any way because you never know what that person's intentions. be your own person and don't ever be someone your're not, and you should never change for someone just cause they don't like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see who's really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend don't respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go.

My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and don't let somebody take control in your life or don't get influenced by people that don't have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Don't try to be perfect for somebody else's, if you wanna do that then do it don't do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it.

But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you can't trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Don't try to act or be somebody that you're not, show who you really are and your true color because that's how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest. It takes time for other people to open their eyes but when they do they will realize a lot of stuff going on. Be yourself and don't let nobody change you in any way, be unique."
966,49DA281C7585,"I agree because this can help some student, for example some student have diffulty for to learning, maybe more activity can help the student, i gonna go give to you my example.

im brazilian and i see many videos for to learing more my ingles and this help me so much, i have class in the school but i study in my house, i know many people that learning ingles in the home.

Some people can not like this idea because some people this not help they , maybe they student no leaening online or whating the videos .

i think this can help they because we need to try new things for make different this in the school, maybe make cool activity.

my friend its nspire me the want to study in my home because i want being architect but i need to strain.

some people need to try new things, becase if we no try new things we can not know to leave they try, because the life its feat of new experiment."
3835,FCF714354720,"We will never learn and grow until we try things we never did. Trying new things would lead us to grow and gain experience. Everyone should improve themselves in order to grow. We must learn about different things other than what we already know to gain knowledge and experience. People that have dreams and want to accomplish should work on trying new experience, learning new things, and improving themselves.

Trying new things is the key to gain experience. Soccer players do not always play only soccer. For example, they try different sports to learn more about them. Teachers always try to come up with new topics to teach their students and help them gain more knowledge. Buisnessman always work on improving their buisness to grow and become better. To gain more experience we should try different things.

To learn things we never knew about we should work hard. Soccer player work really hard to become the best. They do that by learning new skills from big players. Also, teachers try to learn new languages to be able to teach their students who does not speak English very well. Kids should learn from their parents the good things so when they grow up they would have a lot of experience that they learned. We must learn new things to become successful.

We must improve ourselves to become successful. Bodybuilders always work on improving their body and getting big. However, parents try to improve, and change the way they treat their kids with to be able to teach them good things. People that just moved to the U.S.A should work on improving their English to be able to talk with everyone. To become successful we should improve ourselves.

In order to accomplish our dreams we should work on trying new things, learn things we never knew about, and improving ourselves. Engneers try to come up with new ideas to build better buildings. People that travel a lot always learn new languages depending on what country their visiting. Athletics try different sports to improve themselves. For all of these reasons and many more, we should try new things to become better and improve.  "
2812,CD7201C66BBC,"Students being able to graduate a year early from high school is excellent choice for any lower clansmen thinking of graduating early in the up coming school year. In the past years lots of high schools have witness a portion of students graduating early due to the students choice in education. Not only does the student have the choice, but gains more responsibility, and thinks about his college future. Every student should have that choice in graduating early since they have every right.

Having the choice to graduate early probably sounds like a pretty good idea, to any lower class men trying to see his options in high school. High school choices are pretty slim but knowing you have that option during your 4 years of high school, means you could take that challenge and overcome the odds from everyone else not taking that choice. A student taking that choice is well aware and willing to take full responsibility on his choices.

Gaining responsibility through out this path, is great for a student to obtain. Obtaining responsibility shows a lot in a character, because having this trait takes you far in life, and shows you don't procrastinate in completing a task. In all Honesty responsibility is a major key in a student looking to graduate early, a reason is because you are getting double the work, taking all core classes, and multiple tests happening throughout the week. Just by having double the education in a single year takes a lot from a student, but having that commitment and responsibility shows, and proves a lot in a hardworking student trying to graduate early.

Working hard and succeeding in graduating early is gonna look good, in a students resume for college. One of the reasons a student could graduate ahead of time, is most likely because they wanna get straight to college. Going to college is probably on every high school students mind right about now, but colleges will automatically notice a change in the students class, and be aware of them graduating ahead of time. Colleges noticing the students activity is a good thing for them, because they notice how the student is ready to take another step in their life, and willing to put a lot of effort in their tuition as well, just by doing this they could take a lot of consideration in allowing the student to attend their college.

Overall graduating early is a great choice for a high school student looking into this option. All students in every school district, should all have that choice for themselves. If the student makes their choice they should take into consideration that they will need to take a lot of responsibility in completing all task through the year for all core classes taken. Lastly to take note that colleges have a good eye for them, and seeing the choices they make and how they are doing through their high school years. "
3403,E9F50492B159,"It is true that curfew keep teengers out of trouble. because, being out at night for to late might be dangerous. also, teenagers can have more time to spend it with they are family and friends. and , so they be more responsible.

First, being out at night for to late can be dangeruos. For example, if they stay to late out at night something could happen to them someone might kidnapp them because, at night everyone is in their home not a lot of people is out at night it would be easy for someone to kidnapp you and rap you or do something wrong with you.

Second, teenagers can have more time to spend it with they are family and friends. For instance, adults and teenagers are busy in their daily life teenagers go to school adults go to work in the morning they don't see each other often and, they dont have enough time to spend it with each other and talk to each other so they can have more time at night to spend it with each other and talk .

Finally, so they can be more responsible, Therefore, teenagers must be responsible and know what they should do in their life and what is better for them. In that age teenagers make a lot of mistakes it because, they don't have a lot of experience like adults do so they must listen to adults and follow the crufew in that way they can be safe and more responisble.

For these reasons, curfew keep teengers out of trouble.

3903,FFA6690BC309,"Having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. Although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work.

First, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. If the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. Also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. If the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. The students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. Also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision.

Second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. For example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. Also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students school's life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. Having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family.

This shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to study or to do their homework. In my conclusion the life of a student is not easy they need to know how to manage their time so they can go to work or study sometimes they also have things to do at their house taking care of their family members. Students needs to choose if they have extra energy to do activities after school. Students would have a lot of time in the summer vacations so they can decide if they want to do and activities they would know how to manage their time to work and take care of their families member but they would be also enjoying their time doing activities.

1710,81B000BCC5B3,"Succes come from failure without loss enthusiasm. Success does not come as a easy as a it sounds, succes comes from har work and failures.

Succes is not somethig everyone can reach specally without fails and enthusiams. Fail mades people stay down but people decide if yhey want to be down or work harder until they success.

Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best soccer playes in all the world. When he begins his soccer correar ,he was seen as a normal soccer player, he fail some many times. There were soccer games when he did not score any goals or his team loss. His enthusiasm made him work harder and harder. Hard work made him the person who he is now, he is considered by so many people the best soccer player of all the history but is wasen't easy, fails made him work harder in order to success in his correar after 15 years he keep working hard to be succefully in life.

Enthusiam made people work harder until they reach succes. Enthusiam is the feeling that makes people go foward even they fail multiple times. When people have the type motivation fail is just a symple word becuase most of the people want to keep trying until they finally succes in life.

My mom is a good example , a few months ago she was trying to get her Driver Licence Permit. In order to get it she had to took a test that consist about all the rules in the road. She fail the first time, she was sad beucause she could not get her permit but she had a big motivation inside her that impulsed her to go and retake the test again. She fail the test twice , she never give up she worked hard to pass the test. She did not tooked the test 3 or 4 times, she toked 5 times until she finally passed the test and she got her permit, months later she go her Driver license. She fail so many times but she never give up. When you want to succes does not matter how many times you fail, you most get up work hard until you succes . As you can see, succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."
2667,C53073A5A9CB,"I am going to talk about a prompt that Tomas Jefferson wrote, about being idle or always doing something;

Idle or active?

, I think that when you are active you can make and accomplish the duties that you have faster and better.

The reason that i think being active is better, Is because you will get accustomed to always do something and that can help you in your future in your homework, house duties, and in your future job; and i know that being idle does not help you to grow as someone that is uses full to the society, because one of my cousins does absolutely nothing and he start to get into a lot of problems with our family.

If you are always active you are showing to the people that you are someone they can count on, someone that demonstrate, values like determination, and responsibility; and most of the time people are looking for does type of people to manege a work place, food store,school,and companies.

I also think that active people are more likely to be successful,I am sure that it is true because my father star to work when he was only 9 years old and he was always doing something, and then whit the time he reach to be his own boss doing what he like but never stop doing the duties that he give to himself make him a really responsible person; and that why i think that person how are always active have more potential to succeed.

The reason that idle people are not going to get anywhere for me is because most of the time people are looking for somebody with energy and wants of work and if you are one of the people how are always on the sofa watching television i am sure that you wont be the first choices for them.

In conclusion the reason why i chose the people that are active make more accomplishment in they daily life is because that have more opportunities to show to the word that they are here and that they want to be seen and they want something to do and do it better and that they can reach their goals."
3852,FDCBCA9B0636,"Dear School Principal,

I believe that students should have cell phones in campus. If they have something they always wanted from a school. They'll be wanting to learn more. If there's a emergency somewhere where they cant get to the office immediately , they could use there cell phones to call other students to tell the teachers that there's an emergency. Parents won't be angry about this policy because they'll know that there children are learning in ways that they'll want to learn.

So, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. Cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. It keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. You should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. It will be helpful to them. Students will think that education is fun now. And If you really look at it there's not much time of break or free time. The only time they'll use their phones a lot is during lunch time.

Take my opinion and try it . You'll see that i was right. Our school will be fun for students our age. Parents might want to bring there younger children to this school when they get older."
2771,CB327222A71B,"I agree with the Author Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a word that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", because the most important in this world is to be yourself. To be yourself is to make you unique and different for the others. Some of things is important to be yourself is: To be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let others people tell you to be different.

The first is to be yourself. Some people things if you don't be yourself is to make you successful in their life, but the case is not that. To be yourself is make the people in your work, family, and friends see the real person you are. In my case when I came in the United States, I don't like to be myself because I was a little scared the kind of people was here. Every time people talk to me, they look me different. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I know was not me. One afternoon my mom talk me, "" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love help people."" In that moment I changed my life and the way I look people.

The second things is to achieve goals by yourself is motivate you to continue do the right choices, and the things right. To be yourself had more opportunities for work, universities, and scholarship. To be yourself don't only implicate be a good person or help people, is to implicate say the truth, the things you think, and never lie to others people. To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieve their goals and dreams, and she always saying the truth.

The third things what is important is don't let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous or they don't like you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I don't remember very well, but one person say to me that, "" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was, "" Don't let any person to over shine the light you had.""

In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself don't matter what. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let other people tell you to be different. If you let people do what ever they want with you life, you never be successful in life."
2299,AB9FC91ABAD7,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincs and ideas. Many people today and day has the problem about how to take decisions is so hardnees to take your own decisions, because some people think a lot of what decisions to take that's the principal moment that we need help from someone isnt's matter if your dad, mom or an expert . Sometimes in life you have to take your own decisions because you can fell or not but you're going to learn what's good or bad, taking your owns decisions it teach you many things about how to take your own decisions with responsabilitie . I take my own decisions because that can help me to grow as a person but yes sometimes we need somebody also opinion .

However , not everyone thinks like that because they like to ask for and opinion to an expert because, they think that can make you to take the decions easily and that's right but isn't enought for some people because probably they have done before and it doesn't feel enought for them , because that's the opinion that you're receiving probably you can be agree or not, but you still are thinking in what decision shoult they take decisions are not something easy nothing is easy in this life that's one obstacle in life basicaly is one step that can help you to grow as person because you can learn from bad decision that you have taked in the past.

Nevertheless ,

everyone can go to see and expert he or she can give you many types of ideas about what decision you shoul take but when you depends on someone you will never going to learn how to take decisions by your self, how I

say before that is one step the can help you to grow as person, you're growing base on what life is giving you is not matters if is good or bad but that's how you know what's better for you and it help you to grow as a person, makes your life succefully.

Moreover , you don't have to take decisions by your self everything is depending on the problem it can not be a problem especificaly but in case is very important to count with other person opinion it can make your decision more easy ,like my grandfather tell me every time when I talk to him '' be sure of what are you doing'' and what I reffer with that is the you must be right of what are you doing is so important you always count with friends or someone speciall in your life those people can make your life better and far away of the problems .

Overall , people have to take their own decisions using the best way for each of them , Because decisions are not easy to take you must take it without precupation because when we worry about that and we say or we do the first thing that it comes to our brain isn't one hundred percent right sometimes it can be good or not but that's how we learn of our mistakes , that's how life work , it give you a hit when you must think nothing is going to happend, that's why is important to count with friends or your mom and dad but when you're going to ask an opinion of what decision shoul you take you must ask an adult , they are the only ones that they can give you the best ideas of what is better for you and your future and that's how you learn and the most important to grow as a person .

3379,E8DAB90C65F7,"Working with a group or working by yourself.

There is nothing more beneficial than to have a team work, having to work with people that you like, and the people that know what to do; is one of the best thing that could ever happen to you. Now working by yourself gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team.

Working with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what i mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you

Working with a group is not too bad but it can be, me as a student i do like to work with my friends but they always copying me which i do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me. Is sad the way they always have to be in a team to be a better person in life, which is not fair because some times they are not even the person that did the work.

I prefer to work alone better than to work with a team, is not like i do not like to work with other people; that is just how i am. When i work with other people i feel like it doesn't benefits me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. It makes me feel like i can do more without having to need help from others.

In this world i have learned so much things, i have learned that you need to put you first, you need to think about you first, also that you need to have your own back. Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. and my answer is that you should never feel useless, you should always think about yourself. "
1117,56AC4BE71C2F,"If weather or not students should or should not attend class from home by online video conferencing . I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home , for example if one day you are feeling sick but you want to attend school and get all your work done that will be one method . Another example will be if you are out of town and you still need to get work your done , the perfect way will be doing it online. Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school. I honestly feel much better doing work at home then being school, if you need help or anything just email the teacher. Another example will be getting to do all the work from doing it in bed but yet still doing your work from home should be an option or be required . In conclusion I say that students should be attending classes from home and it should be an option so they could still get there class work done.

2664,C50BE3C76571,"I dont like becuase the student forget all information of the year in the vacations. Teachers or educators feel that the summer because students do not retain information.

I thick when the student have a spring breack or summer vacation we need study in vacatio for not forget all information, we take in the year of the school. Is necessary to be ready to next year. we need take care for not fall the clases.

The teacher well be ready to very year cause sometime the students well be ready for start the year. I think the students they need prepare every year after the summer or other vacation.

Is not bad have vacation in the year because all time study is no good, because the maind no have a relax, the maind need to distract in other thing.

I am not good student but a try to get one is so dificult for me cuse I'm not speak englihs good, but this is not scuse for not study in spring break or in summer, this is for every day to bad studen to good student. nothing is impossible to go better to better."
2543,BCF16DEB277E,"Many people can set a good example by the way the behave but you can also Influence people by the your professional career you have. I believe example is not the main thing it is the only thing because younger people growing up look up to you by the way your behavior is and they hear the kind of language you use towards friends and adults.

For example, when I was growing up I looked up to my brother I watched his actions very closely. One day I saw my brother giving food to poor people at 7 eleven and I was shocked, the next day I went to give food at 7 eleven. Eventually, as I was leaving the store the manager called me up and asked me why I was giving food out and I told him that I saw my brother giving so I thought that was the right thing to do. In another occasion my brother and mom went to the toy store to buy some toys for a birthday present for my cousin and my brother really wanted this toy so and my mom said that she was not going to buy for him so he started kicking the floor because he was mad at my mom and because of that my mom bought him the toy. So the next day my mom took me to the supermarket with her and I really wanted this snack from the shelf and she said that I could not buy it so I started kicking the floor and crying therefore my mom bought me the snack. Since I saw my brothers actions and behavior towards my mom and saw it worked out well I did the same thing.

For instance, one day I heard my mom arguing with my dad on the phone because of some misunderstanding they had and my mom was using foul language to address her part of the side and my dad was using it too. So later on in the day my mom called me on the phone and told me to go get my little brother at school and I told her it was not my problem to get him and then I started using foul language on the phone because I thought it was okay because she used on my dad. In another occasion I heard my brother giving out compliments to people on the street and by the way he spoke it influenced me to say the same thing as him as walked the streets.

Some people may argue that people get better influenced by a person of its professional career because they think they got to the place there at right now by showing they can go anywhere no matter what example they show.

In conclusion I believe that example is the one and only thing that influences others becasue what your actions do your younger sibling and friends are going to follow it and get influenced by you. the actions my brother took I followed them if though they were good or bad I got influenced by it. Also the way my mother was speaking and the language she was using towards my dad influenced me to speak back to her that way when she called me.          "

1372,69A8A08ED3E9,""" In this world you decide who do want to be either you get along with it or someone teach you"" although some people think that our character formed by influences beyond our control nevertheless we choose our character traits people on your environment and also people who you talk to i believe that the one that influence me is that we choose our own characters

First People on your environment influence a lot because in front of them you decide who you want to be and you choose your traits so i think that you choose your traits on the type of environment that you are on on you are living for Example My brother Generic_Name when he was around me he was a different person we talked like brother help each other as brothers when he was around Dad And mom he was another type of person he was not the same with me he was more kinder but when we were on school he another type of person he was mean He didnt care about me and other people he wouldn't treat me he changed his traits to a whole different level That proves that a person can changes their traits depends on the environment that they are growing.

second people who we talked too we eventually we change our way to be to different people the way that we talk to our people are a different person when u talk to your relatives friends coasins brotheres we eventually changed the way to be for example one day A guy named Generic_Name recived a call from his parents saying Generic_Name its time to come home And Generic_Name respectfully said Tes mom i will go home right Away after he finish his call he talked to us saying Dude i need to leabe but like right now!! screming that proves that we change the way that act with different people or the way that we talk with different types of people.

to conclude we choose our character traits because we talk and and people around we choos ehow we act aroubd people people who we talk to are the ones that affect us more because thats the one that we do on daily bases the other one people on your enviroment is the way that u want to be looked by different type of people around your self."
2181,A2EA2D3D0542,"Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.

Group work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.

Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two.

Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.

However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.

I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!"
708,367781F47105,"Most students in high school who would be looking forward to attend college barely have enough time to even get a part time job. They would work as hard as they could for a better and brighter future. For that specific reason,committing a career by the time they enter high school would be a bad idea for the students. They would need more knowledges,they would be too young to to decide,and that could also ruin their dreams. Students should not commit a career by the time they enter high school because they would not benefit from it.

firstly to begin with,lack of knowledges could not only destroy their dreams,but also them. They would not have enough experience. Everything would be confusing for them because they didn't have a chance to learn them back in high school. One thing for sure,they wouldn't be good at it as well as they would be if they finished high school and attended college. Also,they wouldn't be as open as they should be.

Secondly another,being young and have to decide something that is going to be a big part of their future is the hardest decision. They might regret it in the future. There is a fifty percent chance that they'd change their mind when they grow up. When they are young,scared,and have pressure on them they usually make the worst decision,but later in life when they would finally realize it. It'll be too late to fix it. They also would even blame their parents in some kind of way.

Also,that one decision can ruin their life and dreams completely. They wouldn't even be interested in going to college. They might drop out high school when they would start recieving checks because they need money and they get it at least every week,""so what's the point of going to college"",they would think. They would also need more time to think and decide what they really want before choosing something they might regret.

In conclusion,not only high school students,but every other kids in general have the right to have enough time to decide what they want when they feel ready to. They need to finish high school,go to college,and have a chance to choose what they want to be. When they don't have enough experience they are usually shy and scared when doing something because they don't know what they are doing. When this happen,the kid can blame whoever he or she wants because his or her parents and the school guidance should have sat down with this kid and tell the kid all about high school,college,career,and better future because that's what they are here for."
2031,9947BA6C3149,"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education. Going to school now it is something that some teenagers do not considerate important student can take any class online.            "
3394,E9705A9C0FE5,"In this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. Some students don't know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life.

Now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they don't know. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. In other cases that i haven't really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future.

I would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City. I also love doing makeup, since i was little i would always play with makeup and growing up i would buy a lot of makeup but didnt really know how to use the products. until i started by little learning how to use the products. Now a big makeup store at the mall offered me a job their because they loved the way i do my makeup. Growing up i started seeing my interest and also had options on what i would like to do in the future.       "

Sometimes, spent time with my family can help me because we can talk without phones, for example: When we are going to eat, nobody can have their phones in the table because my parents said that technology will be disrespectful and also, technology can take out my time with my family for example: Sometimes i need to do my test at home or homework but, i stay in the computer and i never go to eat with my family that's for i said that we can enjoy, and spend a lot of time with our parents.

The communication is very important in our life. If we have homework, work ships. We can share our ideas and help us each other for example: When i came here at the united states i don't even know English and i was scared in my first day at school because i thought that nobody could speak Spanish for help me but, there was many people to help me and give me information about what the teacher said. Now i understand and i can defect my self with English that's for i said the communication is very important in our life.

In conclusion the technology can be a negative idea in our life because we just want to play in the computer or phones. Sometimes, the technology can help us in so many things for example: test, and work ships but, when we have time with our family, we has to enjoy, and pay attention to then. Family is very important also, the communication is another factor that we has to take care."
1238,5FC3C342E64E,"I agree with this statement because you are capable of doing anything you want. Just because you have mastered something it does not mean that you cant do anything beyond what you have mastered. Having to master something can be a very big accomplishment to people including myself. Mastering one thing is good but mastering more than one thing is a huge accomplishment. Everyone can go beyond what they have mastered you just have to try and never give up and you will have mastered anything you want. Mastering something takes time and dedication its not just something you can do over night. It might take days, months, years who knows how long but at the end pretty sure it will be worth it.

There are many things people can be mastered at such as teaching, playing football, etc. Just because you have mastered one thing it does not mean that you should be done mastering other things beyond what you already have mastered. If i were a NFL superstar it does not mean i cant go to school and become a doctor also when you retire you would have something to do. Thats an example of what you do to go beyond what you have mastered. Some people are born with skills and for them all they have to do is fully master it. Mastering is a skill that allows you to personally get a hang of what your best interest are. If you want to master something there a variety of ways to do so such as go to college or a camp etc.

Mastering something is not very easy it takes time and dedication thats why doctors take approximately 12 years to get the highest degree in becoming a doctor. I strongly agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson cause if you dont master beyond your intentions you will not grow. This is true because there are many things to do in this world to not be mastered at only one thing. What it means by you will never grow up is because you will stay at the same level Intel you unlock your full potential. This is a great quote for someone who was trying to master one thing in there life but after reading this quote it will help them realize that they can master more than one thing.

This is a example on if you become a master at one thing and get lazy you will never grow up cause you have only mastered one thing in your life. Life it self is a precious gift and special skills are to so take advantage of it and learn as much as possible. So if you go above and beyond what you have mastered you will be a good and grown person. Its good in life to be good at just more than one thing cause it will help you in many ways such as getting jobs or getting in to schools. If you have more than one skills you could do anything you desire in life which is a good thing. That will be all for my S.A."
58,04ACA7EB3994,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always.

Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes.

Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school.

Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer.

In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more"
2401,B2919590BDB0,"I do agree with Prime Minister Winston Churchill. My first reason is because most of the people in this world will think that is really easy to be successful, but time will get difficult as you and your self are growing up, for you to be failing over and over again is just a meaning that life at some point will be easier, Most people if they keep failing they won't know what to do, Keeping your hope and thoughts on your mind that's how you will succeed. keep on following that dream no matter how hard time will. Sometime you will feel like you're not getiing answer or at least a signal.

My second reason is that failure is going to come at some point in your life for example; teenager come at school, adult come at work, money wise, housing. failure is something that we all should learn how to over come that problem we should think for a solution make a plan in our life. how are we goinf to fix this part and find a solution to over come that problem if we need help from somebody.

My third reason is that as soon as you over come failure you start learning thing about themselve, that they didn't know before, most people find ways to stop going back failing, that's when you start gaining the believe on keep going on practicing every single method to do not fail again.

In my conclusion most of the people have those hard time and is bext to talk to someone about a look for answer, in way to find the solution and fix this problem by yourself or with someone important in your life."

703,35E552843ADF,"Teachers and students volunteer to meet with those who have difficulty in certain subjects. By having a afterschool homework club. Reasons for a afterschool homework club? An afterschool homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject better

First of all, they get better grades by helping each other on their homework and they can socialize to know more people, make new friends. Plus they can make up stuff they haven't done at all and have a zero in their grade. It also benefits in all ways, you could get straight As by just taking 1-3 hours extra hours of your day and putting the work into it. If you don't work at all you could consider trying harder to pass the class.

Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering to join this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun.

Therefore, they could understand the subject better by getting someone to help them. Doing loads of extra work to get your grade up and understand it better. They could help each other out and could achieve their goal of getting to understand the difficult subject.

Finally, those are the reasons why the idea would be a benefits for everyone. It could help everyone out in every way. Thats why I consider this idea to be true and make the club available for everyone. Also theres a ton more benefits that could help too."
261,12FE853D6B88,"I agree with Emerson's statement because people should be themselves no matter what. You want to always show the real you. That is the beuty of life,connecting with different types of people with different types of personalitys. People in this world now a days are cruel and mean that have no heart. People bully others because of theres clothes,shoes, and how they look. You can get bullied for anything now a days, its very sad. That's why people who get bullied hate themselves and want to become something they are not.

I remember one point in my life, i was deppressed. I kept getting bullied because of how big my head was or how skinny i was. I know it sounds funny, i laugh all the time when i talk about it dont worry. I stopped wanting to come to school because of that. I never wanted to leave my house or talk to anyone. It was very sad. But one day one of my close friends asked me why i wasn't coming to school, and i told him everything. He told me straight up to ignore all the negative stuff that people call me and live your life to the fullest. Since that day, we have been bros for life. He always had my back and i always had his. A few weeks passed and i told my mother. We talked for a few hours about how i should ignore all the negative stuff because life is so short that you can't let anything stop you. That really changed me and how i see life.

Trying to be yourself in this world is very difficult now a days. Just by telling someone that there shoes are ugly can really change the whole person. They start buying stuff that they don't really like. Also doing stuff they don't want to do. Suddenly they start doing bad stuff. Just to fit in with other people that have all the nice clothes and shoes etc. People really can't be themselves because of judgment.

There should be more help in this world so people that are going through this can get help. People should be motivated to be themselves and also love themselves. Some people can really say somethig mean and the victim could commite suicide, just because of someones judgment. People should start treating other people with respect. Parents should start teaching there kids early on how to show respect. People shouldn't care about someone elses opinion. People should live there lifes to the fullest.

People should feel very accomplished to be themselves in this world. People really make you feel like trash when they say something negative about you. There is always going to be negative stuff coming at you, that's normal. That is what makes you stronger and turns you into a great human being. That is what should motivate you to do great things in life. That is what should make yourslef and everybody close to you proud. To be yourslef in this world should be the greatest accomplishment."
3806,FB6F9B24FD1B,"I think that students should commit to their career at a young age because it will move them and encourage them to go further into being someone that people can rely on, and its a big help to society and the community and it will help it a lot because theirs generations that had some kid that turn into an adult did their part in that generation and the after that and after that, and some things change in the peoples mind once they get older and wiser and that is the big picture. Also some students might change that career because they want the best for them selves and its not bad to change who you want to be in the future because no one is choosing this for them, they are the one thats doing this for the best of them so when they want to make money love what they do to get money with passion they are living the life of a normal money making person and it doesn't matter how much money your making its STILL MONEY!!!! and some people around the world still don't get that. Soon they will want to go to college and thats big step into having their career because theres more studying to it and the teachers aren't as nice as you think they are and they will be very comfortable with you goofing off in class, after that your out of the game, also it a lot of money to pay yearly for their tuition and depending if your were born poor, rich, some what rich or wealthy enough to pay then your fine to stay in their to study party relax and play video games with the boys and eat a lot too if your close to a restaurant, cafe, buffet or a diner then go ahead and fill up that empty stomach. After that when they have a good time their and read to graduate they'll go to a University, and I gotta tell ya it not the same as college, it more studying and more work and if you can handle that pressure with no sweat then your set for a nice year in there, but depending how long your going to stay there, it can 1,2,3 or 4 years when you think you have enough knowledge about your career and studies then your set to get a job that pays you well and have a happy life. Now that we got that out of the way, we need to talk about how the students are going to be effected by by all that has happened to them and how far got to that end point of their journey to be successful in life and be some people he or she can help one another so they make that persons life better and make them feel happy, the students need to be happy with how they are working because if they don't they can have stress and anxiety and soon they don't want to work any more and we can't have that in our generation, so we have to let them be someone that they want to be before some one else will!. Before all that, about all I said about the colleges and universities, their Parents, oh yeah the big dogs the ones who have created you to be a good person with a good career their child/student get older, the students have to tell their parents what they want to be when they grow up to be an adult, yes I know that they always say that when you were a little kid, but your still a kid but a teenager from the age 13-17, your still going to be told that and you have pursue your dream or goal of being someone that goes without saying, so this is why students should identity their careers by the time they enter high school."
1293,6305A432AB38,"The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.

It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. The importance of having a positive attitude can be bigger of what some people may think. A positive attitude describes how much effort people are putting into the problems they are facing. To see the good side of the things in life help to be successful. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier.

First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.

Furthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems. When people have a good attitude toward a problem, to face it becomes easier since people will look for a solution instead of being stuck. The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.

Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.

To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through. Some people may say that a positive attitude is not always needed to become successful, however a positive attitude is the key to success in life. To be positive in life is really important, since it helps people to face problems and become successful.               "
1173,5AC1AB0965F6,"Ever since I was little I would dreamed of going to Hawaii. I would always think of seeing the beautiful crystal clear blue seas. I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean.

reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks I've been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games.

Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup.

One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays.

The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when we're in a water park.

Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city i'm gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos.

Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when i'm in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family.

The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium.

I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too.

One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually don't have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together.

I would go to Hawaii because I get to increase the relationship with my family and have fun. If I got to Hawaii i'm not be stressed out during that time."
1136,5828FAC247DF,"Should student commit their career at a young age ?

In this statement i will argue if student should commit to chopse their career at a young age. In my opinion, i think student should think about their career at a young age. First reason why they should think about their career is because they could know some step of how to get into their career. They woukd know some steps on what to study or in other words know what classes are the right one to take. An example is that when i was in high school i didn't know what to study for. my teachers couldn't find the right classes for me to take. Most student get into high school without knowing what they would want to study for. Another example was that when i got into high school they ask me for my career i told them what i wanted to be. Once i got into 10 grade i change my mind and decided to change my career. When i try to get into my step for my second career it was already too late to apply which made me now find my own way to get into the career i wanted to be in. Most student get into high school with out knowing what they want to study for. Another reason is that when they don't know what to study for as their career, They don't find a way after in how to get into collage. It is always a good first step as a high schoolar to know what they want to be. Last exapmple is that i didn't think about my career when i was in middle school and now in my high school year i didn't get into any of my career i wanted to study for. When you know what you want your career to be teachers help you get the right classes. Teachers also help you get into the collage you want to study for your career. Some people think knowing what they want to study for before going to high school is just a rush thing for them. People be saying it's too early to know or think about your career. In my conclusion, Most student should know at their young age what they wanna be. My advice to all the young student making their way to high school they should start thinking what they want to be. When they get into high school they will know what to do, how to apply and they would know what classes are just right for them to take for their career."
717,3741D275F8BC,"Some people think that taking classes from home is a easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from from is not alway a good idea beacuse students would not be inspired,not averyone has acces to internet,and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclud that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home."
384,1D31AE0453BC,"60 percent of students have a problem with other subjects in middle schools. Although, some people believe after school homework clubs are irrelevant, I really dont believe its bad. I truly believe after school homework clubs are beneficial because students can study, get homework done faster, and socialize.

First off, I believe after school homework clubs are positive because students can study. Students can study what they need to if they have a little extra time at school. Many students dont have enough time to study at home and a after school club could give them more time to study what they need to. Some students need extra help understanding what is on the paper and studying could help them a lot.

Next, after school homework clubs are important because students can finish homework faster. Some students cant get homework done at home so an after school club could help them. Students can get extra help with what they dont understand at an after school club. Many students cant students can get their homework done faster by the help of other students.

Additionally, after school homework clubs are useful because students can socialize. Students can learn how to talk better to other students. Students can talk to friends when their done with their work. Many students cant talk to their friends on the other teams so after school club could fix that.

In conclusion, I truly believe after school homework clubs are beneficial because students can study, get homework done faster, and socialize. I believe after school homework clubs are an asset to students because it helps students a lot. I believe more people should agree with me."
588,2C7A6E04F7D0,"Accomplish more or Inactivity

Do you think that we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or dose inactivity also sever a purpose. I feel like that we do a lot if we are always doing something and not inactivity. while some may argue if inactivity have a purpose in this I think not, I believe that we can do a lot and accomplish more if we are always doing something because you might want different options from different people, two or more people work better then just one, and you don't have to worry about doing all the work on your self and be worrying about finishing it on time.

Firstly, do you think having different options or opinion would help you accomplish more things? In my own opinion I think having a different opinion and opinion is better why, because someone else way might be better or faster to finish on whatever you are working on secondly, always having a second person while wanting to accomplishing something is better. why because one person might think differently then the other. Like if you worked with someone that was form a different country or state and they did the opposite of what you where doing but it was much faster you would like to learn how they do on whatever they did to finish faster. work could be faster and earlier accomplished by doing it and working it out.

Lastly, accomplishing on whatever you may be working on may help you and the person that you will be working with. I think with accomplishing work you could discover something new or something you didn't know about, and might be good that you would like to share it with you priers and other important people around your area.

In contrast, some people believe that that not being inactivity would help you better you self and accomplish more but I think not. Why because, I believe we accomplish more if we are doing something and working on it because it might get you somewhere in life or better you future and help you in the long run. By sitting down and doing some of the work might not get you as far as the person that accomplish it and will be so much better then the person the accomplished some of the work. This is why I believe doing something and learn more will you more and accomplish more in the long run.       "
1477,7231635A63C8,"The technology has improve this years, allows people to makes think much faster than before and the technology every day its going to keep improving. I think that Technology makes thighs more easy for everyone but especially for does that cant walk, speak or heard. Technology makes thinks much easy and quickly for everyone, If you dont have a car you can shop online. People can buy food, materials, video games, books and everything that in necessary. Technology also makes more easy to talk with people that is far away and you miss. Last year I call my grandmother and she never had a cellphone before, she was surprise that she was talking to me event that she is far away from me that makes me so happy and I was thinking that if technology does not exist I dont know how to communicate whit does people that are far away from me.

Technology is very important this days, for everyone but if we used for good because their is some people that use technology to do bad thinks and that way technology have some negative effects on peoples lives. The limitation of human contact has something to do with technology because there is some people that dont know how to use technology they think that technology is the only way and they feel like there is no other friends but that wrong because technology its a tool for human and if we know how to used its going to makes us life much easy.

In my opinion technology its one of the best tool that we have, but we have to lean how to used because it can helps us a lot and makes us much easy many thinks, but there is only one rule we have to used for good."
3755,F99B20789DD7,"Dear Schoolboard,

I think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to.

I think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for 7 hours. Another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep.

The other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. Also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building.

On the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. Another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. The last reason why

I think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little.

The last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. The other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others.

These are the reasons why i think students should and should not have school extended i think they should extend school for a better education and i think they should not extend school because it is way too long"
3874,FE8A54A36006,"Do you think that students should be able to take classes in school that benefits them in the fucher?

In this paper i will argue that if students should take class that that will guide them towards a specific career. should student consider their career pass at a young age,yes because when the student gets older and becomes a adult he or she wont have to have a boring and low paying job.

Im am in the eleventh grade and I already know that i want to be when in older, I want to be a U.S.M solder.

The class that am taking right now in high school that will help me become what I want to be when am older is JROTC.

You may ask that is JROTC?

JROTC is a class that teaches student about the United State Armed Forces.

Another class that am taking in my school that will help me with my fucher career is Econ and Finals.

Econ and Finals is a class that is a high school requirement to graduate, but i like that class because i know that its going to help me with my fucher career.

What if we dont start preparing are self for are fucher careers after high school we'll be loss, confused,and broke too. In my family i dont think anyone do what they wanted to do i high school . I remember my mom telling me that she wanted to become a Aries but she never became a Aries because in her old school they did't have art and she dropped out to have family.

Working is something everyone have to do.

So agree that its a good idea to start finding something you will like to do when your older in high school,

When i grow up i want to be a United Stated Marin solger and i konw that the classes im taking will help me become that one day."
2892,D15E85D292CE,"""Cell phones"", for the main statement I must evacuate cell phones in school time. Students are often breaking ""expectations"" about using your cell phone in class. But some schools choose to use cell phones for educational purposes only during that time. Now, we should be able to see why cell phones are doing to the students of any school. Cell phones may disrupt students' work, make them feel misplaced, and make them rebellious.

Cell phones may disrupt students' work. This may happen when students play games or text in their cell phones. Probably when students might make them less focus on their work just checking social media. Students of many ages have trouble enough with their homework and also classwork. May cell phones be causing this to begin with? Maybe, just so we know cell phone may disrupt students' work.

Cell phones may make them feel misplaced. What I mean for that is a student just be on their cell phones a lot, an student may just feel better on their phone instead of doing work. which makes the student disconnect with class time. Not even using it to complete work making a opinion sound like a fact. As we know cell phones may make them feel misplaced.

Cell phones may make them rebellious. Another meaning by this is to disrespect authority. ""Authority"" means the staff of the school of any kind of departments. Some students in blood are rebellious, but not the man made kind. They may feel furious when criticize for anything done on phone. They may feel like that anytime with the main disturbance of the classroom. So cell phones make them rebellious.

Next,our argument against cell phones is extremely important to all others expect the students. Students will fight back other supporters of the opposite answer hes been fighting against. My counter argument settles the fact cell phones are not good in class room for any time. Now, students would be more efficient without cell phones than with cell phones. So, this has settled against everyone.

In conclusion, Students think their doing a great work with a cell phone in deck. But in reality, it is making you more and more dependent with your mind. But many people actually learn from it. Either you have a learning style or make great grades with cell phones must see the negatives of this. Other students using cell phones may disrupt students' work, make them feel misplaced,

and make them rebellious."
3899,FF9469424ED0,"All schools have different educational activities, including playing an instrument. There are so many things you can do when you play an instrument. Everyone has seen marching bands doing all types of exciting things in the middle of a football game. Have you not seen the routines they make, those take hard work! Orchestras play classical music and make their sound flow in the room. Not only do they play classical music, but they also play loud and exciting music. Everything you can do while playing an instrument is enjoyable. Some things are more enjoyable than others like being able to listen to yourself making good music, going on fun field trips, and being able to find all different types of music.

While playing an instrument you play all different types of music, and all of the pieces of music are good. When you hear yourself play a song well you get a boost of confidence. Hearing your class play well makes you confident that your concert will sound great. It feels good to know that you're capable of playing music that others who aren't able to do. You get to enjoy the amazing sound your class makes. Whenever you play an instrument you normally audition for the class you want to get into and when you get into it, you are full of joy. It's always nice to know that you can achieve the level that you want to achieve. The opportunities you get while playing an instrument are endless.

When being in band or orchestra you get the opportunity to go on field trips. Schools don't normally go on field trips unless the students are in band or orchestra. They offer the field trips to people who play an instrument because of all their hard work they put into it. All the field trips you go on are enjoyable because of the people in your class. You always make friends whenever you join band or orchestra. Some schools know that the students want more fun, so they include more field trips than others. Every field trip is a gift to the students who play their instruments from the school. Some places that schools go to are Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park, and many more exciting places. Those all have roller coasters, water activities, and carnival games, who wouldn't want to go there.

Every movie or show has a soundtrack which the classes can play. You can always search up the sheet music to any song you want to play. You can also make your own sheet music and play that yourself. You can play every song on an instrument. People enjoy playing the music they've wanted to play since they first started playing an instrument. There are movies that people love and the people who can play an instrument are able to play that movies theme song. Not a single song cannot be put in sheet music so, if anyone ever wanted to play their favorite song they could search it up and it would pop up. Even though some songs are harder to make sheet music for they're still possible to do.

When playing an instrument, practice does make perfect. Nothing about playing an instrument is easy, but everything about it is fun. The effort put into playing your instrument does pay off at the end. Playing well can make you so happy and proud of yourself. Not only are you proud of yourself, but others are proud of you. Being able to play an instrument is a privilege that not everybody gets. There is nothing that can stop someone from becoming a part of the music community. The friends you can make and go with to the exciting field trips. Play all the music you've ever wanted to play. Everything you can do in band is limitless. "
3014,D7EC70BFCAB6,"Allowing cell phones in classrooms it can be a benefit for some students and a disadvantage for others. Although some say that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment . Actually it shouldn't because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted.

Some say that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classrooms because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. For example one day my English teacher told me that she let her students to use their phone during a test to search something about the meaning of the words that they doesn't know. Then, she told me that she told them that they can only use their phones to translated the words that they doesn't know what it means or to translated to their own language. After that she says that she gave to her students the test and she went to seat to her desk, but then she was observing that one of her students was using his phone too frequently, she went to see what the student was searching and she saw that the student was searching for the answers of the questions that the test have. After that, she saw that one of the others students was taking pictures of the exam, she went to see why the student was taking pictures of the exam, she ask him that why he was taking pictures of the exam and he told her that he was sending the answers to his friend who was sitting in the back seat.

Moreover, she told me that the other day that she was explaining the class, some students were using their phone and paying less attention to the class. Also, she says that the students who were using their phones during the class when they got the test they doesn't know what to answer because they were distracted with their phones and they got a lower score in the exam. I believe that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classroom because is a distraction for students, sometimes there are students that when the teacher is explaining the class they are using their phones and when the teacher gave them a test they got bad score in their test and that can be a problem because their grades can get very lower.

Those who believe that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms have their reasons, they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment. One example can be my friend Generic_Name, his history teacher always gave him assignments that he have to search in the book about the Civil War or World War II. He told me that it's very complicated for him to search some things about those tittles in the book because the books doesn't have enough details for him to what to put in his assignment or sometimes he doesn't know how to summarize the meaning of the paragraphs that the book have. However, when the teacher let him use his phone he began to search about the tittles that he have to search and he says that it's more easy for him to understand more about those tittles because he is using his phone for a educational purpose. Also, he says that when he plays Kahoot or Quizlet live (

those are learning games that sometimes the teachers use to help students to study

) he learn more than when he read a book. In my point of view I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because for me sometimes is very complicated to read a book because there are some words that I don't understand, but when I use my phone to search it's more easy because in the phone there are some meanings that I understand .

In summary, some say that cell phones shouldn't be allowed in classroom because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. However, some believe that cell phone should be allowed in classrooms because it can help students to research for as project and to do any other assignment. In my opinion I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because it easy for me to search the meaning of a word that I don't know and I feel that I learn more then treading a book.     "
3658,F5B510BCCA2D,"Enjoyable activity is a good thing when it comes to being yourself and having fun. Enjoyable activities can be sports and ban.

Sports is enjoyable activity because athletes use sports as a excuses to get good grades, so they wont have to tell there friends that they are really smart. They do this because they dont want there friends to call them a nerd or what not. Sports can be a fun thing to some people, but others use that to show there smartness without getting laughed at. They can also, use sports to prove to there parents that they are worthy. Sports can be used in a fun way too. Such as, going out on the court or the field, just being yourself, and acting a fool.

Another joy able activity is band. Band can be a enjoyable activity by showing who you really are through music. Music is always a big part of somebody or something. The reason why is they can express them selfs through music. Some examples can be, when your trying to explain yourself to somebody, you can do that by using music. Such as, find a song that you think tells people of you the most and tell them if you want to get to know me listen to this song.

In closing, enjoyable activities can be fun and hard sometimes but u have to stick with it and pass through that. "
1056,508A9EC12C44,"Technology in the currently life we have is something great, but sometime can be bad. The technology is in all places is in home, work place ,hospitals,schools, vehicles is in everywhere you go. Because the technology make the human life more easy in many things. But make the people more easy I thing is no something the technology make people be lazy the people play video games and other thing. They choose stay in home playing when the can go out an play with the friends soccer or other sport thing the get a healthy life.

Technology I agree because in the actuality the technology help us in many things to save life to study you go everywhere you see technology. Now we need that for have a great life with the technology make the life more easy help others. To safe life the technology is a key for example the machines the hospital have help to doctors to safe a peoples life. In the schools or job helps also in the schools the computers helps the students to make the classwork. In the job if you work for example in construction, the machine and tools are technology for they make more easy the work.

Thanks to the technology we can get communication with other people like family, friends, etc. If you are in other place or country you can get communication the 24 hours of the day an the 7 days' of the week have a great communication with your favorite person. Now you can get communications also for social media and messenger or calls .But always be have to take careful because the people use technology for bad things.

In conclusion the technology every days save or helps people. we use everyday in us life is something grand. But always we have to take be careful the technology help us but sometime people can get a addiction. In the life everything in excess can be dangerous so we have to take a valance in our lifes."
3274,E36B406AFE70,"Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but it's actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest.

While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed

On weekends, when i'm at home and i'm lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. In my opinion, I think he's doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time.

When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. The reason why I want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or i'll be caught in a family emergency.

Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isn't always true. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if i'm idle."
2896,D184EDBFB3B8,"I believe most of the students prefer to work alone, but I prefer to work with a group because we have more ideas and we can finish our work faster.

One of the reasons, I like to work in group when we are doing a project or classwork for English class is because I know my classmates and working together we can share more ideas of how we are going to create a magnificent project and impress our other classmates and specially to you our great teacher.

The other benefit will be to finish our work faster because everyone in the group will collaborate with some work that it will help us to finish the work without worrying to turn in the project late because we will help each other to get the work done and get a good grade as a group.

On the other hand, most of my classmates prefer to work by themselves because they do their project the way they wanted to create it and they like to have just their ideas in their work. Also, they don't like to be working with classmates who are only playing and not taking the work serious.

Overall, working with a group shows, how the students or other people become more successful not only in a business, but in classes too you can get good grades and have done an excellent work. Team work not only help you to get more abilities and ideas to work with partners, but also helps to create a strong and unique friendships."

Therefore, students will have a good choice to work one year early or to enter the college early. Students will finish high school early, work force one year early, achieve their goals early.

52,04659704890C,"Having a good attitude is important if we want sucess. If you don't have good attitude in what we're doing then we can never get the things that we have to do done for for instance if I didn't have a good attitude everytime things got hard I wouldn't have done the things I did. Take for example If I would've had a bad attitude everytime something went wrong in my life I wouldn't be as happy as I am now because we all go through difficult times but how we choose to handlle it is way different.

Take famous people for example if they would've given up everytime people said horrible things to them they wouldn't Have as much money as the do now or famous as they are now. People who don't have good attitudes don't want other people to have success because they wish they had a good enough attitude to do what others are doing. If we decide to have a good attitude we can get more things done and accomplish way more then anyone else.

It's also nice to help other people with they're attitudes. By helping other people we can have way more success it's just simple if we want to accomplish more then we can help people with they're attitudes and help them get way more things done. Another example I have a friend and she didn't have a good attitude about her grades but she didn't want to work hard to improe them so I told her if she wanted to get her gades up she had to have a good attitude about them and she did the she started working harder and she improved so much.

Having a good attitude in life can help us out so much when we want to sucessced. It is important to have a positive outlook on life and not focus on the negative things. If we focus on the negative things to much we may forget to look at all the positive things in life. It's better to spend our time enjoying life instead of worrying about our problems alot. After all we only live once and if we spend our whole life being negative then we won't be happy in life. Being negative in life isn't how we want to spead out life if we focus on all the bad things in our life we will not sucessced at all.              "
2475,B821E1D68BE7,"our big break. Summer is a season with very hot weather schools take this whole season to give students a big break summer is almost 2 months of break .Although some educators feel that the summer break is too long and schools should be year round schools. Which mean schools have one month of summer and a longer winter break. Nevertheless I think schools should not be year round schools because summer have a very hard weather also students use this time to plan some trip with family and friends.

Summer has a very hard weather to even think go to schools. Some day the temperature goes to 96c or more this is to hot for students. This hot temperature will make students swearing a lot and have very hard head hurt during class time level of streets will increase make students get bad grades or be angry all this time. Students who work in hot areas will feel more difficult to do a simple thing than students who work in a warm area . Hot areas make you not focus in your work.

In summer students have 2 months to enjoy make some family trip or things like that .Some students and families take this time to make some big family vacation plan. students wait for this time of the year to do their vacations. Because summer is a perfect time to go to the beach with family and friends or go outside the country to visit other country as we do not have school in summer we do not miss any day of school . trip can take so much time and students think summer is a perfect time to do. In summer students have enough time do anything students want some students use this time to find a job during summer as students do not have school they are more focus making money,so summer is very important to us to have some time with our family or make money.

In conclusion summer is a hard time to go to school but a good time to make some trip or money so the government should not cut off our summer. this is our time this is our big break. this when students can relax for a very long period without any preoccupation about schools work summer just happen one time each year students have to enjoy students deserve it for all hard work than students did in the whole school year.

1418,6CD851AF4D16,"I think we accomplish if we are always doing something, because it will help you to learn more things, we have to always stay busy doing something if we want to achieve. Doing anything will not help you if you want to be someone in the life. One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind.

Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle. For example if you want to be a professional soccer player you have to train and work very hard everyday on it to get it, practice skills, develop your abilities. If you just watch videos on YouTube and don't do anything, that will not help you to get it, you have to put on practice to get it.

Another example is if you will have a test and you want to get an A, you have to studies your notes and not be lazy, if you just go to take the test without know anything, you will fail the test, you have to be a positive person, feel comfortable, and believe in yourself.

In conclusion if we want to be a successful person, we never have to be idle, and we have to always stay busy doing something, always be positive, see the potential you have and feel able to do everything you want, and never be inactive, you have to be an active person to reach your goals. Also you have to believe in yourself and take off negative persons of your life."
1774,863550AEB938,"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldn't be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they don't let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law.

Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. That's why parents would feel like it's a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids don't even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldn't feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didn't have parent's. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and they'll have to face their actions.

If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think it's not important to learn like if it isn't important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults.

Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they don't. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldn't be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they don't listen after they've been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful.

In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. "
1213,5E49CEB56FB3,"I think that this is wrong for the students sometimes ,because they can't learning the iphone is one thing for that they can't focus in the school.

when the students use the iphone in a moment imporntat when the teacher is teching somthing they can't understand because the never put attention to the teacher, and is very important the eschool because you can be someone better the , you can have a good future and don't matter what.

We need to do everithing for get a good job , and make money , but if the teachesr never put a stop or don't help to the estudens they never do that .

the tecnology is something that have to the all person now all one want to be or use the iphon for everything , the people need understand that all is in our mean we can do with only think and want to .

Everyone need to finish with this problem with the phones and do something change the thinghs that affect we life .

One day verything can be different to now ."
1086,532528134425,"A example is the best way to show others peoples how to do a better thing, when somebody is teaching and provide some examples is one way feel the teacher wants to help.

When i was a child my grandmother shows me many ways to set things and advice, i would like to say i want to teach my friends and others peoples things like they dont know, another ways is tell them or teaching like how to play soccer, how to find this, etc.

In my life i have learn many thing like i never think i do like maintenance in toys, fix computers, and other things.

And i like my teacher teach very well because is one way to learn better others teachers dont like teach very well or just like to be angry with the students in the class and thats the reason why the students say i dont like the teacher because is angry or dont teach very well.

Give examples is the vest way to understand thing like i never understood. behavior is other thing how behavior we are in the class or in the house, our behavior is one part important in the life because the the others peoples could say that person have a good behavior i would like he can tell me a advice or example how to make this or fixed.

A example is not the main reason to influence others,there are many like the peoples watching you. just to watch others peoples i am learning new tools for the future.

I have no plan after High School the only thing is i like technology and electricity the most two parts of mi, the life is like a second we can lose everything or die.

I would like to say some words before i leave, we are human everybody make mistakes, you and me, the only thing to fixed is learn about the mistake i made or someone can help me to have a good behavior in our school or no matter where.

There is one more way is read newspaper, watch the news, ask peoples, ask questions, there are so many ways.

A good example is see how much you can do, how much do you know, dont matter what kind of color you are, you are special for everyone from the most youngest until the most oldest, every one can give a little knowledge how much he know.

There are many advice we can use to exhibit our effort and value, many peoples come to me and they ask me for a question or advice they tell me everything they want to say because they trust on me, i am the people like listening another when they need help.

I am a people who can feel many thing for others peoples.

We have the life, family, friends, neighbor , many people who can help and have a big heart, the reason we are here is for something, maybe no one knows but another yes they have a purpose on this beautiful world that our God give us.

And my final reason is have a good day every day i try to be on time every day in class because i dont like be late is one reason for me this is my goal for this year and of course pass the SOL and the class at he end everything worth, my teacher are a good example of how to influence with others peoples, comment, conversation, i like the school is one of the most reasons."
1217,5EA76942F5C7,Me as a student think that we should have at least a (C) because most students use sports to express their feeling out. Sometimes if they don't get what they want they will just stop trying; in school work or even homework. But in the other hand some other students will try harder so they can play or do what they love. So a (C) sounds good but a (B) sounds even better; so students like me could try even harder and have a modification to so. So I say to the principal great gob and keep it up. When we are looking back and when we have a great job that we like; we look back to middle school and say thank u for pushing us to max when it came down to doing work THANK YOU.
264,13450D581EC9,"I am agree with the Waldo Emerson's prompt. He wrote that "" to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

""Never give up."" This word conveys our intensify about our thought. It makes us courageous. Life is not a bed of rose, life is struggle. Every single person has their life struggle. Nobody is a perfect at they look. A perfect man is he who win the struggle. A successful man, he not get success in a second. He had lot of struggle in his life,but he don't stop for his goal. After long time keep trying made him successful. He adjust the struggle and keep go through the struggle and win the struggle which is make him success.

For example a soccer player has his goal to make a score so that they can win. But for making a goal he has to cross the against team then he will success to make a goal.

You failed !. You are done your life today. We couldn't expect from you this. You fool !. You looser. Now you go home and get sleep that's all you can do. Should I listen them and do what they want or give up my life? NO!.I am failed, i am looser but it dosen't mean that i can't win anymore. Don't lose hope. You have hand,you have brain,you have leg use those one day win come to you then you can show them that you did. you made it.

For example,you are not good in Math but it's dosen't mean that you are bad in Social Science. Show your talent. You can't able to solving the Math equation but you have talent to make Social Science rules.

Time is valuable more than everything. A good minded people use their proper time. If you use time and you failed in your success then don't lose hope,don't stop, don't blame on time and yourself. Time can give you more opportunity to use it and make yourself successful. You just have to keep try. But if you being lazy you just waste your time and you got looser reward from the time. Always remember that time never gonna come back.

For example, If you don't do your homework the teacher not gonna give you a grade. You gonna fail in this subject. You just waste your time. But if you do the homework but is incorrect. The teacher can give you one more time to fix the correction though its incorrect.

An Inspiration can make your goal. If you look or read about successful person how they became successful in their life you also can inspire to do what they did. An inspiration can bring you encourage. Make you sense what you want to do and what should you do for your future. There are different people has their different choices. From the successful people you can organize your life.

For example, there was a story about Robert Bruce and a Spider. One day Robert Bruce was laying in the cave and saw a spider was trying to climb the wall but its failed seven times to reach the wall of top. After seven times keep trying makes its successful. The spider reached the top of the wall. This event make Robert Bruce inspire himself.

Everything has their opposition. If you wanna be a good man you have to know what is bad things. The same way if you want to win you have to know what is lose. Fail is common afire in human being. If you don't fail it's mean you dosen't even try. Fail is a part of our life. But don't get depressed yourself by depression. You fail but you have more option to start it from the beginning again. Before you stop try just think should i try one more time. Maybe this time you can become a winner. Just one more think can bring your success.

For example, You digging a soil for the gold. You dig almost come to the gold but this time you give up and stop digging the soil. If he dig the soil one more time he can see the gold which one he want. So always think one more time before you quick.

An aim can make our decision properly. An aim less man can't success in his life. A right decision depend on your future. First make a routine for your work. If you want to success in your goal you have to follow your routine. In a student life its hard to follow the rules. But if you try you can do it. In student life student should give full attention to their lesson. homework should be done before going school or college. if you continuously follow the rules it will be easier for you to success your life.

Don't be lazy. Lazy is a weak point in our life. From the laziness your life never gonna successful. So always do hard work until you done in your work. some people we have in our society they has dream but they don't wanna work. If you don't work how can you full fill in their life. Always keep try to get your dream. We have time we have life just try as much as you can.

Some people in our society some times they messed up with your dream or your work. They don't wanna let you to do your work. This typ of people are very harmful to our life. They always bothering you can't lets you doing work. That time we should ignore them. Don't say anything with them. One day they will leave you automacilly.

For example, if any person can bother you every day and if you ignoring him one day he will not interest with you and leave you.

The success of life bring you happiness. You will feel proud yourself. If you show them that you did it then they will fell ashamed because they thought wrong think about you. So never be lazy. Always do hard work,keep try and think about it what should you do or not. End of the moment it will be

Happy Ending for you because you erase the wrong think the people think about you."
2345,AE262E9DC747,"It's true that some schools allow student to their cell phones for educational purposes. But some use it to look for answers to cheat on a test or text some of their friends for answers. Some student who use their phones always get sidetrack for dumb reassons. Some kid will the others students attention to what the kid is doing. Why some the teachers let it happen well they sometimes don't know that is happening.

Students who take out their phones right in the open wil get caught easy. Other students try to hide them so no other tescher can't see them. Some other kids will even sneak glance at bag or pockects or enven in their bagpack. Teachers will even get the student with their phones out red handed. Even with their phones out students barely pay attention in class or at were there going.

Some parents will even get some complains form the school that their kids had their phones out. The parents will have to go the school to pick up there childs phone. Some students will try to steal their hone back on their own so their parents don't find out at what happen at school. The parents will tell their kids that not to do it agianbut we all know waht will happen."
2017,9860EE12D1B3,"In this competitive world people have to be a mastered in many things, but people are used to work in places that they are in comfort. Usually, people don't try to do something new that they are already do. What is the best advise to get growing? Ralph Waldo's statement is one, which motivates to others to explore new areas, and people will not grow, if they do always the same.

To begin, in the society there are many jobs where is necessary to expand in new areas to get improvement like photographers that usually work shooting pictures, but they know how to shot a video also. Photographers can explore new areas like cinematography world or work as a journalist. They know that explore new areas is best way to grow as professional. In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness. Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing.

To add, People will not be able to grow, if they don't change in order to grow. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they can't play and be the best player either. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful.

In conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement has the reason, for people is not able to achieve their goal when they do constantly the same. People should explore beyond they are used to do in order to get growing. In many circumstances dare to do new things will gave people a benefit. Changes in live are always good it is just will to do it. People don't have to be mastered in one thing but many of them."
1633,7C14A6539215,"To keep the resources of the world, Can be necessarily to implement the idea "" four-day school week"". "" The four day school week"" consist of ten hours per day. Adopting this idea it is going to conserve energy and resources. If they spend the whole evening in the school they can learn more and be more prepare for school.

It's a good idea to implement this but at the same time it has some disadvantages . One of them can be that the students will be stressful. A lot of hours in just one place can make the students to got bored an tired of it. It's not just that a lot of students have responsibilities as paying rent and bills. They need to work to pay their responsibilities and if they come to school for ten hours they won't have enough time to make more hours in their job.

If the students assist to school for more hours they got the chance to learn more and improve their skills. In those 10 hours they can even get an extra class , a class that they want. They can have a lot of time to understand more their classes and be more prepare for them. Having that time will be easy to communicate with more people and teachers . The don't have to rush in class anymore , now they got the time to prepare more in class.

To implement this can be a bad idea because if the students come to school for ten hours they will end it up with stress. Be in a place for a lot of our can be really stressful If the students are stressful of school they won't do their best because they are tired of it. Not all the students like to go to the school and for them will be even more stressful. If the students have homework will be even more difficult to get a good rest. They won't have enough rest for them.

Some students got responsibilities at home like help their families at home or some of them have to work to pay their bills. A lot of students pay their own rent and they need to leave early from school and work more hours to effort enough . If they leave late from school they will work less hours and at the end they won't have enough money . Leaving late from school and working a lot going to make them tired of that routine. The students need time to rest as well. If they don't get enough rest to do what they want to do at the end they will end it up stressful and not doing their best at school and at work. If that happens they will have a lot of problems because if they don't do their job property the will got fired and without money to pay their bills. In school can happen the same thing as well with bad grades and not paying enough attention.

In conclusion having this idea can be a bad choice . A lot of students have things to do beside school like working or helping their families . Coming for ten hours can make them to stress easily .Student with stress won't do their best and at the end they going to have bad grades. The students need to rest and do whatever they want in their free time.          "
2301,ABBA50242CFA,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.          "
318,1721F085F81E,"I disagree with this statement because your first impressions of someone or something can change overtime. When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things.

Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days.

First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesn't like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time it's going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person.

there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldn't figure out where i've seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didn't we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and haven't seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday.

The first impressions aren't always impossible to change, you learn to change your mind overtime and start accepting things for what it is.          "

It really hard to teach young kinds because some older student don't even remember the work from any grade like me some time time my little sister be like can you please help me in be like am sorry dont even remember it really difficult to teach a young student. Older kinds have difficult time to teach young kinds they have different way that there teacher teach them how to there work. It really hard to know there work in explain the way we explain the kinds the better they understand what they supposed to do.We have to have a lot of passion to do it.

2.I think many student don't really get it because they older student some student don't really get it some of them dont get it fast but some of them need more extra work with it.Older student some time they explain good more then the teacher but for me it better in adult because will ask question in they know well because they teacher. Like some time i explain my sister what is bad but some time i don't know so I ask in adult to explain me really well that how in school work to young kinds may not really get the older kinds a younger need a adult to understand it well.

3.I go to a program is about math but i really understand because we share opinions of different work they do like student have com plenty different work they have it the hard way in the easy way student get more confused when they have com plenty different work like my math teacher I have different completely different work. I don't understand her nothing at all but I think because different language but asking some else in the program she explain the easy way i cant understand her.

4. Student can""t really get it they need some one to be beside them in tell them or teach them I really wonder if there were only one student or a lot because is program but if it was only one person they really can concentrate that really good because there a lot lot if there was more than one person it fine because it will be more help that the main effect if there was only one person in not a lot of them in was a big problem with then.if there were talking to much it was big problem for the program.

5. paying attention is really good thing so the student can really get the work they can get in learn what they do. The most important is if the young student get it if they don't get it they will fell the test because the older one properly know but can explain can find the easy way so the student can understand it really understand it good they really more information how to treat the student in explain it good make sure it good to them make sure not to just yell at them you have to have passion. talking with some one like your age understand it all of us have different kind of ways to explain it in to learn it. Like me I understand it with a adult like PROPER_NAME that one my teacher i can listen to him but some with younger them me or alder them me.    "
629,2F93B934ED27,"Control Our Characters

According to what the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock have been say, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Our character formed by influences beyond our control.

We should all choose to control our character because that will save us from trouble,

trust our self, and have a lot of relationships with friends.

First, we should all choose to control our character that will help to save many of us from trouble because being in trouble that very bad and many people will not talk or keep in touch with us or have any friends also. For example,

Generic_Name always many students keep saying bad stuff to him to make him fight with them, but he never care about what they say he always go to tell the security about them. He dose not want to be in trouble, that make them very angry because they are in trouble not him. That makes Generic_Name safe, and out from trouble. We have to be strong enough always and find another way to control our character to be in safe said, not being strong by fight and be in trouble. Control our character will make us trust our self.

Second,

we should choose to control our character that will make us trust our self because when we control our character we will trust our self in everything. For example,

Generic_Name works in the hospital hard to make everyone feel better, not sick one time one person was sick about to died, but she dose not cry because of that she control her character and she trust her self, So she give him a medicine and he dose not died he feel very well. Generic_Name never give up she always trust her self and she control her character with everything. We must control our character so we never give up and we can trust our self.

In the other side, some people may argue that choose to control our character will make some people think that we are sick, scared, alone. Thats true because when we choose to control our self a lot many people will think that way. However, we choose to control our character because that will make everyone want to be with us we will have big relationship with everyone. For example, Generic_Name always control her character she also has big relationship with everyone many people want to be her friends they like how she control her character. People are very likely to people who have good character and to people control their character that's why we have to control our character.

Lastly,

We all should choose to control our character to be out from trouble, to trust and believe our self, and to have a lot of friends. The result from when we control our character always we will be away from any trouble. Also, when we control our character we will trust our self in all the stuff and in anything even if it's hard. Therefore, many friends we will have while we control our character, friends do not like to have friends who is always angry dose not know what to do they like the friends who always control their character and who know everything. To control our character is not hard if we need a better life."

1939,925DBAC486E5,"Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. The reasons high school students would want to do this is to reach their career early or they have personal matters that make them want to leave early. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. It is a good idea for teens to take the three year program, because they are trying to accomplish their goals early.

Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. High school has bullying and other issues that could leave them with no choice but to want to take the three year program. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age.

The three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes. For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. For highschool teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieve their goal of finishing in three year.

In the three year program you are given choices on how you would like to do youre work. There are schools that could let you take the program through online. Students could also have the choice of taking the work over the summer right after school goes on break. High schools that have this program are giving students a huge benefit. it is a good idea for teen s that are taking a three year program to advance quicker to their future goals."
1872,8D0B6FE098F1,"Should students take the programs that the school district is offering, which is to allow student to graduate high school in only three years instead of taking full four years.

It is clear that finishing high school in just three years can be the best opportunity. One can be to get high school out of the way. Not everyone likes high school year, therefore it is the great way to graduate early and accomplish to get into your dream college school. This program that let you take courses during the summer can be a great option to finish high school quickly, the aim of this study is to, so students get out of high school, and have enough time to start processing and think about what want to do in college or start working to help out their parents on necessary things, such as, bills, rent, and etc.

However, not all student would take this action, it emphasized that students may not have time, it can affect their sleep schedule, and not completing school. Some, of course, may think that you're not learning fulfilling, for instance, regular school year is like ten months and if one take the programs, you're only taking extra courses during the whole summer, that's like saying you're missing a whole ten months of school. In addition if I were to take this program, I would really do as much as I can during the summer courses, and courses to get extra credits that i need for the colleges that I;m applying to. and soon I'll start working, and apply for a scholar ship, also applying to universities or colleges that i would like to attend to,

In conclusion, many people may not agree or join the programs, we all have different opinions, different beliefs, this program can help many students to start off thinking majors,work, so therefore, I'd recommend students to take this offer, and see where it can take you. I can assure one can accomplish something for their goal in the future. "
223,10BE9BFD7D41,"the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, "" your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

I disagree with that because our character formed by influences beyond our control, for example we all leaned whats right or wrong, let's take a babies for example the leaned for people all around them, by seeing what they do for example how they speak, how they walk and how they dress. the only they can not be influences by other people if their parent stop then from doing all those things. take me for example as a baby grow up speaking french because thats that the Language. when I moves to my grandma place she speak Spanish with me so now I speak Spanish, and french I could never speak those languages if I was not influence by those around me.

I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what you what to be in the future now it you choose to make even tho you have a choose there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. we all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. if you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who I'm today? Was I influence by someone? Or did I choose to become who I'm?

I disageer with that ""character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" "

Also, Teachers agree that would be a good upgrade for the students to have a extra meal that is healthier and it is in a good quantity.

In some others opinion, the new menu in the cafeteria will affect the businness in our school, beacuse the students that are in the school for a longer time will not like to change their favorite types of food.

Some students might not agree with the changing of the recipe in the cafeteria, but for those reasons, the principal and teachers agree that the new menu would be a healthier and more elaborated meal for everyone in our school."

I think the people cant do nothing without help because is necessary to have help from others. people who dont us technology I think is negative because without technology the people can do nothing for example they cant to have contact with other or for a jobs. I believe the people who use the technology can to be positive because can do anything, how have a job or the technology can go to be negative to because somebody use the technology, how in her house, for example; the child can cause a problem with they eyes, or another thing more.

I think people cant do nothing without help of other, because is necessary to have help from others, or help of the technology. The technology can help at the people for a job, but the technology can effect to the family to, for example; at the child, to use technology is good, but I think we can put a limit for her effect to have. The effect have the technology with the family is can cause a problem with other or for a job, because someone use the technology.

3000,D743AC1EB08D,"how conserve energy and resources

The energy, and the resources are the most important factors in the world, for the evolution and survival of the human. There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource.

Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan.

In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier.

In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this. We are going to understand that is necessary protect our resources, because they are indispensable to keep us alive and keep going with this life what we have in the twenty-one century.       "

Later we pass the football to eachother or we punt the football and someone has to run and try to catch it. I find that activity fun,because I get to be with my friends/teammates and we get to travel with eachother too different places like Generic_City,Generic_City,Florida etc. On the bus too Generic_City we study with eachother like how we're going to help eachother out or like a mini game plan. We sometimes help eachother with homework or needing someone to help study. We love to play football beacuse we are pushing our body to become stronger,healthy,body in check,and our mind out the gutter as in our mind roaming freely but thniking at the same time. Whenever I play left-mid I got to keep eye on my oppenent that is in front of me because who knows he might end up getting the ball passed to him and it's my job to stop him from going further then where he is because if he goes further it'll effect me because it's my job to make sure he doesn't reach the end zone or go further then the spot they were originally at. Football for me release any stress I have on my mind like I just release the stress and be focus more on the field the thing I was stressing about earlier because like for a person like me i stress a lot and think too much for my brain and my head ends up hurting because of too much stress,over thinking,things on my mind. Football is a very enjoyable sport to play.

I enjoy uploading songs and get paid cause it's one way of making money by the internet but at the same time it can be really hard sometimes becaus eyou have to think what song you're going to upload and make sure theres no mistakes in it very well audio quality.

I like video games as well beacause you think what your next move is about to be beacause lets say you're playing fortnite with your friends you got to over thinking the other team thats pushing thats pushing you and your team because they might be better then you guys combined so you got to out play them. Once out play them you got to kill the other teams to win the game "

played the drums and the viola that was my favorite until i got to the eight grade I started to play the trumpet and I liked it.

first of all, I like to do science experiments and one time in seventh grade I dissected a frog and it was fun. Once I was in the fifth grade and I put a gummy bear in a cup of water and it got bigger. In the eight grade i made ice cream and it was fun but it was so cold.

furthermore, and the sports that I play are fun to because I play tennis and wrestling. They are very fun and i like tennis more because I got hurt more in wrestling then tennis. And most of my friends do tennis and I like that. And I have more fun around my friends.

finally, In sixth grade I was in band and I was in strings class. I played the drums in math class and I played the viola in strings class I was very good at the instrument but I stopped in seventh grade. But in the eight grade I started to play the trumpet and I liked it I think I can play that instrument better than the viola and the drums.

played the drums and the viola that was my favorite until i got to the eight grade I started to play the trumpet and I liked it."
468,234F1BA430B7,"Why is it important to learn the experience from others?

It's important because you know what you're going to do or you know what you're going to see.

For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore when i went to the country she went i experienced what she did and what she saw.

When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what they've expericenced and that sometimes leads to preparing because they've told you what they've experienced from them they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad.

So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesn't want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legecy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when it's his time to shine.

Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team,preparing,proving people wrong,improving, and some lead to bad things like you're new student and a bunch of girls see you're hanging out with a girlwho has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think she's so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from ther experiece with her , or your best friend and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isn't as plesent as your best friend shared with you.

2201,A42A8E5FA4CD,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.""-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Some people rather be individuality because they didn't like the opinion of others.

To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.

secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others' do. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.

In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. However, that is not true because be individual make's people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others' believe for us. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

In conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. Being individuality people became to learn many things. Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves."
1686,8060FCE12001,"Should students enjoy less summer vacation and more winter break. Why would they change the vacation time? Cant it just stay the same as usual? Would the students like like that change? Are those changes going to help the students in their studies?

First of all some students wont like this change because,in the winter time it can get really cold ,so the students wont be able to go outside,walk,nor play. Also one of the reasons they wouldnt like the change is that i summer break they can be outside and go out places. In the winter could get really cold and the students stay outside for a long period of time they might get a could and miss some school days and affect them. If they miss schools days they will be behind from the class.

In the other hand some students might like that idea because in the summer time it can get really hot outside .If its really hot outside people can get dehydrate ,but for other reasons summer days can be some amazing days. Some benefits of summer : going to the beach,amusement park,camping,and travel. Reasons that students will like to have more summer vacation:more vacations days,nice weather to go outside, go to the pool,explore nature and helps them to stop using technology.

If this change in vacations happen I wont like it,because I like being outside in warm weathers and i woulld hate to have less summer break and more winter break .Plus I hate when we dont have school when theres a snow s day. I

like how the vacation time is right now because everyone can enjoy some vaction in the tie that the like the best . I am aslo sure that most of the student will like to keep the same time of vacations beacuse they want to have more not less

In conclusion the time of vacation will not change because the students will prefer to keep the same one .They will like to enjjoy the time not hate it. My point is if the studdent dont like the new time they will problobly wont like to g back to school and just ingnore it. So if they want to change the time talk to the student if they are ok with it ,if not then make a solution about it.        "
1222,5EF21F142C51,"Have you ever wanted to seek others opinion on a choice that you had to make?.Seeking others opinion on a choice you have to make is right. I think seeking others opinion on a choice that you have to make is good,because people can help you make the right choice for your self,learn what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you,and learn new ways on making that choice

One way you can seek someone's opinion on a choice that you have to make,is by asking people what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you. by doing this you will known their opinion on making that choice. Most people don't ask others on what choice they should make,because they think that people would make fun of them on making a choice on a certain topic. For example when someone has to make a choice on if they would buy some toy against buying a video game. I too have been in that type of problem. Another example is making a choice between wanting to get something you like but there are more than one things you could get and your friend making fun of what you say you want to get. To sum up my first reason of why it is good to seek people's opinion on making a choice,because you then can use others opinion to make your choice.

Another reason of why you should seek others opinion to make a choice is to get help on making the correct choice. One way you can get help with deciding on a choice is by learn the steps of make a choice. One way I learned the steps of making a choice was from a book my mom had got me to read. The steps of making a choice are first think of all the choices you have,then checking which ones you like and they suit you,and finally making your choice!.One other way is to ask friends and family to help you decide on your choice. A example for asking your friends and family to help you make you choice is,One day you had went to the video game store and you see two video games you really want but you only have $70 to spend,so you ask your brother on which one you should get and he says the racing one,but you don't known if you should save more money so next time you get both or just buy one now.

Lastly,My final reason for why seeking others opinions to make a choice is right,because you can learn different ways of how you can make your choice. One way you can make your choices is by finding all the possible outcomes. Another way you can decide on what choice is by asking friends and family give you ideas on the different choices you have and which ones are the best for you. An example from my life I have is,one time I was going to the ice shop and me and my brother did not known what favor to get,so I said why don't we try the new favor,because we had not ate before,so I think my idea for what we should get was good,because I came up with a new choice that we never had thought of before.

In Conclusion,seeking people's opinions on making a choice is good. I think seeking others opinions on a choice you have to make is right,because you can learn what they would have done if they had to make the same choice,help you make the right decision,and learn new ways on making that choice."

1482,72765D1D4721,"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes.

3302,E508BAFC3BF9,"Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

It's not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you.

The school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future.

For me it is a great option for them to attend it."
97,0756FC69B810,"I would like to talk about the interesting quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote,and how he tell us to

""Determine never to be idle."" He thought that is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, and that we can accomplish more if we are a active person because the inactivity also serve a purpose in every person life.

First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we don't take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we don't gonna know how much can be done if we don't try to do the things that we wants or needs to done.

Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives. The big thing is never stop doing the things that we wants to achieve,and be proud of what you receive.

Third,we have the option to choose between doing something or stay inactive,because inactivity also serve a purpose. This is the big deal ,sometimes we don't imagine that we prefer do nothing without see it, we don't see what we are doing at the time. That's the power of inactivity. We have to see clearly and make a decision of what we decide to choose.

In conclusion the interesting idea of Thomas Jefferson of write this quote, was a amazing idea ever,because at this time reading his thought we can see the importance of be determinate and be someone who knows how much may be done if he is doing what he needs to do, to have the right to accomplish much more than he thinks,and have the power to choose between doing something or just stay inactive."
72,0563F089C239,"To the principal:

Cell phone is a very popular device now a days and almost everyone use it to communicate with others. I have a cell phone my self too. I think cell phone is appropriate for student to use during lunch periods and other free times as long as they turn off their cell phone during class and use it for appropriate matters. Cell phone can help people solving matters by talking on the phone and contact when some emergency happened.

Cell phone can help people in many ways, as long as we have a limit on it.

Cell phone is a device that has many functions. It can help people in many ways. When there is an emergency at school, the best device to use to communicate with your parent to tell them you are safe, or polices to report the incident is cell phone. Cell phone is not a direct contact, but it gives the least secure to a matter such as you are safe, some specific thing happening in school, and some decision that can be solve using cell phone instead of meeting face to face. Cell phone will be fine to use at school as long as students are using it for the correct matter and does not let the cell phone disrupt them during class.

As time went by, more and more function appear on the cell phone can make our student and adult's life easier. Some cell phone can even go to the internet! Some people can use cell phone as a material to find resource, study online, and read books online instead of carry those heavy books home. Cell phone is simplification for many thing you do, it can not absolutely replace books, but it makes easier for people to read and study. If we can let the student to bring the cell phone to school and only let them use it during free periods or lunch time. I'm sure that it would benefit both our student and you.

I believe that the first policy is better because phones are good but no when are use in class.

Just imagine that something is bad how are they going to talk with their parents if they don't have phones. What would happen if something bad would happen after school how are they going to call their parents and if you don't let them bring the phones at all their parents would probably get mad. Then the parents can go and have a protest that wouldn't be good.

That's why the first policy is better.

1767,85D3E5A1D64E,"Students chould not be required to take a music, a drama or an art class. Student should only be required to take classes that they actually need. Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it.

Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student don't take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too.

Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they won't try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they won't actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing.

On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to.

In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elcective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldnt need it to graduate. Electives are just extra classes needed to graduate and they also have no pont if the student are not actually interested. po p"

Would you like to be treated like a criminal for the rest of your life with nobody talking to you or respecting you? 62% of the people around the world are not being treated with kindness or respect. People in many countries like Canada, France, and Russia are not being like a human being. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, that includes being nice, kind, and helpful to each other.

In many countries people are not being treated right. 55% of the people have depression, loneliness, and sadness, because when they are not being treated with kindness they think no one likes or cares about them. Over 200 people around the world have committed suicide because they were not treated how they wanted to be treated. Not being kind or nice to others can cause damage to peoples feelings. People have been effected by other for not being treated correctly.

Treating others with rudeness is not going to effect you or kill you, it is the opposite it will help you become a different and better person than you were before. Treating others with kindness can make peoples day wonderful. Some people might have a bad day and if you help them and treat them with kindness, they will feel a lot more better. Being nice to people will make your life a lot more easier and you will feel like you have accomplished something big.

I strongly believe that people should start being nice to others even if they are not respecting you. Being nice and respectful to others is what everyone wants you to be, but if you do the opposite than your life is going to become harder. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, and that includes being nice, helpful, and kind to everyone."
557,2A9FC8634742,"What does it feel to achieve a high score on an English test after you study all week for? Pretty good right? You feel like all that sacrifice and long hours of study were worth it. All the confidence you build up was because of your own work. True self-esteem comes from achievement. Students and famous artist show us that without hard work, there is no true love for ones self.

First, school is the environment where students learn. In this building students especially show that in order to feel good and confident you work for it. For example; when playing a sport such as soccer, the athlete need to believe in itself to be an outstanding player and for his teammates to trust him when making a play. If the player does not believe in himself, his teammates will not chose him to guide them as the captain or simply as giving passes with the ball.

Continuing, a famous artists in the music industry named Lady Gaga show that when you believe in your passion and you give all of you in an scenery, the feeling of comfort and satisfaction is more than words. Gaga could not be where she is right now if people would have been sorry for her and just give her a contract without talent. In order to success you have to yourself and that's what she did, she develop her talent and now she is the most successful female artist in the music industry with ten gramys and many other recognition.

Contrary, some teachers agree that in order to build self-esteem students need to be commemorated for effort even if the work is not excellent but, why should students get recognition for not making their best effort? This would be unfair for all of the students that work hard for that test score. Feeling sorry for a student is not going to make them successful in life.

To conclude, all the hard work you put in a sport or your passion is going to help you succeed in life. Students are capable of so much and if a teacher praises an alumnus for work that its not worth a good grade, students will feel like they have not done something right and instead of building their self-esteem you would be creating an under qualify teacher or president. Is that what you want for their future? "
3717,F7FD0CB34BBC,"Everyone has a talent or skill. For Example, my talent is drawing. Drawing is really useful because I can use it for a lot of things like school projects,plays,and more. To get good at something I enjoy doing it takes a lot of time and effort for me to be good at the activity i enjoy doing. Every one has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by hard work,practicing,and doing it constantly.

Firstly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that skill is by working hard. For example,when I first started drawing. when I first started to draw i was really bad,cause i didnt practice at all. However,when I started to put that hard work in I started to get good at drawing and then i saw that I can only get better by working hard. Moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. Working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as I get older and get better in my skills and talents. As can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness.

Secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. For example, my friends talent is playing soccer. My friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. Even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. For example,one day I went to see my friend play in a tournament. The day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. After a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. At the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. My friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. After the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. Later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. As can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness.

Lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. For example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. At first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. My dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad started playing the same notes constantly until he learn how to play it. Further more,having a talent is awesome because it can help people with daily day challenges. For example,if im playing a soccer match and my talent is playing soccer im going to do good,or if im in school and i have to do a project and my talent is drawing im going to get a good score because thats where im good at. As can be seen,practicing constantly can improve someones talents or skills.

In conclusion,everyone has a talent or skill they just need to know how to develop that talent or skill. By practicing,working hard,and constantly doing it can be improve a persons talent or skill. Do you think its helpful to have a talent or skill?"
3856,FE14D7378CFB,"Do you agree or disagree about imagination being more important than knowledge ? I believe its important to get peoples opinions on this question because i think Albert Einstein would be curious about what people think.

Once they have chose what they chose they could talk about it, give each other some details, also communicate with another, ask questions on to why they chose what they chose.

I disagree wit Albert Einstein because imagination is something you imagine in your head or dreams it can be real only sometimes. I agree with knowledge because it happens in real life and when you do something you have the knowledge to know it right away. Students use their knowledge in school to learn about English.

In school i use my knowledge by reading books and by reading i can understand what the book is talking about and i will know how i will write a short summary of the book. My second detail is i can use my knowledge in soccer because i can learn new skills and read a book all about soccer and i can understand that i can use my knowledge by knowing what reading is. Imagination wouldnt be more important than knowledge because the things that you will imagine probably wont come to real life. Imagination isnt a smart way to use the word important because it wont really help students, maybe even adults. Knowledge i know that its a smart way to say important because it does help students in school, sports, maybe even with some decisions they will make in life.

Albert Einstein probably asked us to agree or disagree with him because he wants to know what are thoughts are and would want students, adults, teachers to communicate with each other and talk about why they agreed or disagreed with him.

In my conclusion i think students can succed in life using knowledge because its a smart decision to make in life by just thinking if its a good or bad idea your knowledge could help make that good decision for you"

3391,E969EF7D2D8A,"Given students a long summer opportunities would give them the chance to take a restful break from all the ethic school year they have being having.

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families . Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. I think it not a great idea because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves.

Most students should get a long summer break because they have to take their time and review their work and go to summer school for a make up class that would help them to get credits back or graduates the coming years. Imagine have in a break during the summer, would any students have the chances of making up class work during the winter? or would they even think about the ideas of doing a class makeup?. I think no because they would be giving an excuse about the snowy weather and the real cold weather and schools would be canceling which would affects the process of curriculum on what the class are learning. for example during the winter when we sometimes gets a snowy weather we cancel schools and that one day that school get cancel it affects most teachers planing on what they should do for that day. For instance the school would have to take a week off of that summer break so that the teacher would have time to complete what he or she has to teach the students. Therefor students needs a longer summer break to succeed on their goal.

Meanwhile other students need a long summer breaks to spend a long time with their families because they has already spend a long school learn especially the once that had honors class also the students who are in college. Most students who spends some quality time with their family might have a better chance of setting up a goal for the next school year by all means because they are getting a better advice from their family, for example I had a understanding that students who spent the most time with their family discussing their school year would get motivated and has a goal for themselves before the new school year, meanwhile in the winter break, you wont have that much time to spend with your family, because most of your family who live far across would most likely not want to come visit because of the winter. For example when during the winter most of my family who lives abroad or out of states would never come to visit us during the winter break because they said it winter and it really cold, while in the summer each and everyone of our family would come to visit because we spend some quality time together and they always give me some good advice on how to be successful on my education and what goal I should set to gain my success.

Finally though other are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. With this opinion, I think am little bit agree because during the winter the snowy weather kind of disrupt everything or activities that was supposed to happened during the school year. Meanwhile another hands the students does not have to missed a week or weeks to school but a day or two. Therefor they should get a long summer break even tho they would gets a week or two off, for instance I believe if they get a a day or two there would be no chances for them to forgets everything they learned during the time school opens to the beginning of winter. for example if they miss one or two days they would have a day to revised their notes and maybe be prepare for a coming test or quiz in the future, never the ;less they wont have to study for too long for a test or quizzes again.

In conclusion

Most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families .

because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves. Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. And I believe that students should always have the opportunity to have a long break especially a long summer break.

2708,C77A361A7476,"Is it good for students to to finish high school early?. Students should be allowed to take classes early because they do all their work in time , they take classes over the summer or even after school. They also get to go to college faster. They also get to walk and get there diploma faster. The student get's to go to college to study for what he wanted to study for.

The students who study harder or finish the work they do should be allowed to finish school in three years. If they study hard and take extra classes let them fish early. That's all up to them , if they care about their study let them walk early. The student put's his or her mind set to finish school early witch is great for them. The student who finishes school gets more time off of school. But at the same time more stress on them.

At the end of the day the more students that finish school early have one full year of no school. They get to focus on what they wanna go to college for to study. But that's only some schools, some schools don't even allow students to finish school in three years. In some schools they make you do the full 4 years of high school. Some schools probley want the students to do the the full 4 years of high school because they probley need a class on 12th grade.

If some schools let some students finish in the 3 years then the school wont be as packed. The schools need more space cause of more students coming in. They need to have more space and it would be less work for them. But at the same time it would take some time off the teachers. Some teachers have the time to help students and some don't.

Welp that's all have to say about schools letting students finish school in three years. I really think schools should let students finish early because they work hard to get there.

If the student finishes his or her work they should be allowed to walk early. I think that all schools should allow all the students who want to finish early to let them. It's good for the student that means he or her is educated and can get a good job and go to college to study for something really good. "
602,2D8464A3BD5B,"One year ago. I though that business was the career that I wanted to study, but it was really hard to me. I could not do anything good in that class. I was fail that class and I was really stressful I did not knew what to do. I realized that business it was not for me, but I though that was to late to change my decision. I talk with my counselor and she said that I could change the career. So, I

decided to chose another career and now I know what career it is the right one for me. I do not know if I going to change it again, because I can be a undecided person. As well, I realized that happens every time that it was normal. I talk with my classmate, and they say that same thing happen with them. Although some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career, actually it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study.

Some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career. The only problem is that they do not know that is a problem for students. Everyday I heard students, classmate or even my friends that said '' This class is really hard for me, but I can not change it because this class help me improve my career"".

That words make me think that they are unhappy and stressful.

The best way to help students is that they can change a new career. Maybe that career that they are starting are not for them or students can be undecided in what they want to study, and they just pick one.

There is a lot of reasons why is a bad idea that students commit to a career at a young age, but I just have two of them.

In addition, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them. The dream of all kids it is to be like their parents. They want to study the career that their parents studied, even go to the same university they parents go. Sometimes is different their parents put pressures on them to studied a career that they dont want. So, students chose the career that their parents studied or they parents wants them to study . Then they realized that the career they pick is not right for them. This is a problem because now students are unhappy and stressful. Sometimes they wants to quit school because they think school is hard for them. When is just because they pick the wrong career. If someone do a statistic about how students feel about their career that they chose. I think the probability of that students said that they think the career they pick is not for them will be above of one hundred percent.

Also, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can be undecided in what they want to study. There are a lot of career that students can pick, it is difficult just pick one. Students can find skills that help them in another career. Even though their skills are good in the career they pick before. They decide to pick another career. Sometime the decision that students takes are not the right one, but they continue experiment new careers. That is basically life is about, decision. When students takes a wrong decision in their careers. they are learning. Maybe students decides to learn two careers or more than two they take different course or classes to achieves their goals. I think students can be undecided in what they want to study and that is the best thing that help them in their career, is good that students can experiment different courses.

In conclusion, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study. Sometimes students can be very impulsive and can chose whatever career they want, but they not realize what career is the right one. Also, students sometimes could not decide what career they want to study. The best way to help students is to let them know what they want to learn. I think students will be more decide in whatever they want to study.      "

one is if you have a goals trough the year something that you want to accomplish or you have a dream you must start to take a step by step reviewing it every single day saying to your'e self I can do it even though when no body see you're work no matter how long it will take , but eventually you will get to that point where you want to be as long as you tying you're best every day, and you will be successful in life.

A lot of people want to accomplish their goals, but the thing is they don't actually take action why because they afraid of fielder you can always win, but you can be the best as you could be, and you never be same again because you come this way if you don't do something every day you're life will never change.

3645,F53E50C57938,"Technically, students spend seven hours in school and seventeen hours at home regardless of what time they sleep or what they do when they get home. Students should have more time to study at home, rest and prepare for the next day. More hours in school will ware out the student causing it to effect their grades. I disagree with the school board's plan to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life.

Not all activities student perform happens in school. Adding an hour and a half to the school day can affect the student progress at home. For example, a student can be a player in a local soccer or basketball team, adding more hour will give the student less time to practice and get ready to the game or match and the student will also have little time to do his/her homework or complete an assignment or project given to them. The student having less time to practice is going to take a big tow on his/her team. Maybe the student is a very good player and his/her team needs him/her,he/she having small time to practice will make the team lose the match. This decision will not only effect the student but the teachers too.

Everyone wants to go home and relax from a long day work. The decision of adding ninety minutes to the school day is going to interrupt what the teacher and student do in their everyday life. Some teachers have families they have to take care of. They may have to pick their child or children from the babysitter, preschool or school if the don't use the bus. They also have doctor or dentist appointment they have to attend or have to take their children to. Teachers have chores or duties they must preform at home like shopping for groceries or picking little brother or sister from school. It could also be that they have another place to work at after school in order to earn more money. Both students and teacher have busy lives this decision is going to effect them.

There are many reasons why adding one hour and a half is bad but these are the ones I could come up with. I disagree with the school board's idea to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. I think if the school board is going to add more time to the school they should high the pay of the teacher because it take time off their schedule."
1825,898A8417D70E,"Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didn't go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works.

If a student wasn't available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they haven't done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And it's a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused.

Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you don't understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they won't lose points and grades.

On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you won't receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they won't be confused or fail the class.

In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, that's why I'm base with school programs."
996,4C3AFB55C4F7,"Imagine someone that you know, that is trying to show you what maturity looks like. And she set a example for you to see, by how she talk and how she treats her friends and family. You watch how the person act and talk. Later, you start to follow what that person does. This influenced you to also be respectful to the people around you. Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others because people follow what you do,know right from wrong, they are going to influence more other people.

First reason, setting a good example to influence others is the best thing because people follow what you do. They look up to you as a role model for them. Whoever you hang around with, that is whoever going to influence you. For example, if someone is doing a act of kindness, then you are going to do the exact same thing, because it influenced you. Philosopher Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Overall, if one person set a good example in life, it influence the others also.

Second reason, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because you know right from wrong. If no one set examples for others to see, then they would not know what to do when difficult situation arrives. Examples guide you to do what you know is right. People would not know how to act if there's no examples to be set. In summary, examples setting by other people help you make good decisions in life.

Third reason, some people may believe that setting examples by someone's behavior is not the best way to influence others. However, I believe that setting examples is the best way to influence others because it's not just one person that they are influencing, but many more people. For example, if a girl help a elder lady that needed help with carrying groceries inside the house, then others will see that and learn to help people that are in need also. Because of that one influence, others will care for people that need help. If one person set a good example, then others will also set a good example for many more people. In conclusion, many people will be influenced because of that one example that people set.

The best way to influence someone is through examples that are set by others, and how their behavior and attitudes are towards people. Setting examples is a good way to show people what you are trying to teach them and it gives them a idea of what's happening. Through all of these examples that people had set for you, they will influence you. When you do the example, because it influenced you, others will also catch that influence from you. So yes, setting examples is the only thing that will influence people and make a big impact in people's lives. "
2047,9A5193D1C19B,"Positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has a big impact in our life, and remove negatives thoughts in an incredible way. Also, if we do not start thinking in a positive form; life will be hard for us. Furthermore, positive attitude guarantee a different way of thinking it can change the way we are, and how our minds are more open to others opportunities. I agree with positive attitude because it can change our lives for a better future. Positive attitude is the thing that all humans needs in life.

Firstly, if we have a positive attitude our lives can change in the way that very few people can reach. For example, we will gain more opportunities to jobs like have a good recommendation of the society, finding jobs would not be that hard,

and gain to have more friendships. In addition, other case is the behave with the family that almost all young people has for example: having good communication, feel good around them, etc. Also, discussing with other people would not be a issue because we are prepare for how negative attitude appears in the persons who does not want to change the way of think. Moreover, our positive attitude can change the mood of a person.

Secondly, positive attitude improves our mind state in the way that negative thoughts cannot go into our brains. However, sometimes this negative thoughts can also ruin our day by putting obstacles like, the boss is angry and we do not know how to react, having a bad lunch, or no having enough hours of sleep. but, positive attitude has a big impact that right away make us think in a different way and make us feel secure. In sequence, an experience at school that all human being has is when we have a test and we are worry that we will not pass, the teacher comes and say ""is not a big deal, i know you all can do it"" and that is where positive attitude comes. Also, positive attitude has to influence in everybody, so we can have a better world.

Thirdly, we all are different, but we can try to improve our skills in positive attitude by reading books, listen to other people, and make a change in our habits. On the other hand, we can try to make contact with people that has positive attitude to the maximum, they will help us to see things from a different perspective of view. In addition, introducing new people in our lives will make a big change. Also, it will make us more responsible at the time that we have to read, write, or talk in an appropriate way. lastly, this will lead us to a better and different way of think; it will improve our knowledge.

Lastly, positive attitude can support us by building a better future for our lives. But, sometimes it can be difficult to manage our emotions. Positive attitude can improve us to do better in our emotions. It will make us strong in whatever situation we are passing through. A lot of people that are around us would not like it but, is a process that we want for be different than them. Positive attitude is ambition for those who wants to live better and wants to reach their dreams."

3846,FD972500F1EC,"Do you have a positive attitude? If you do, are you enjoying your life? Today, many people living in U.S. and people has many attitude, and some peoples has good attitude that key to success in life, others has not good attitude. Although, some people think that attitude is not important to the life because of it is dependents on how you work harder, one might think that positive attitude is the key to success in life because you do not stuck in same problem, you could become strong, you could have many supporters.

First, you do not stuck in same problem. If you have problems about your job or in your life, and you do not know how to fix your problems, but If you have positive attitude you could think positive way to your problem, and do not need spend the so much time for your problems. At the least, you can figure out fix your problem more good way and you will doing to be great in your job or your life. When I was middle school I was playing basketball, and I had problem that I always think about If I miss this shoot and scared to shoot in the game, but I changed think to positive way that I can do it, I will make it. So, I really enjoyed every game and I did make it so many score in the game.

Second, you could become strong. If you did big mistake in your job or in relationship, of cause at the first you will be sad, but you could change to positive way quickly so you will work harder and you could fix mistake. Two years ago I was dating with boy that he goes to same school, but we did not work out not longer. I was so d and I was cried every day, but my mom told me that ""you will be fine, glow up and become strong then make him jealous"". So, realized that stay in sad mood everyday is not good for me, and I changed to think positive way and I focused more about myself, I did my makeup, I bought new cute clothes. And my ex boyfriends asked me to If you want mo to back together, but I said no because I knew he will hurts me again, but I was so happy that I could make his jealous and I told myself that I win then at the same time felt strong.

Third, you could have many supporters. If you have negative attitude and you always sad then you always say no or I can not do it other people might start thinking about you that not fun person because If someone trying to cheer you up but you keep saying no, it will make triers uncomfortable. No one do not want to spend the time with negative person. If you have positive attitude people think about you that nice, and fun person so for example, your boss or your teachers and friends, they will support you and your life become grateful.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is the key to success by you do not have to waist the time small problems, you could become strong about anything,

you could enjoy your life, and you could get many supporters that support your life and so important to success in life.             "
3131,DCF9F70FBA91,"Do you think we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? I believe that we choose our own character. I don't think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be.

One of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are. The way we are tells people about ourselves a lot. It describes who we are. For example some people who know my sisters and I so well say that we're all so different. That's because we are all our own character. Some siblings look up one another so it makes them wanna be like their older sister so , they don't get to make their own character.

Another reason is the way we treat people. The way we treat people is part of our character. It helps other people see the way you are. They judge you to see if you're nice or mean. Also what you hear about yourself makes you wanna act different.

The last reason is the way you choose to be. You get to pick who you wanna be. Although some people say that your character is already formed by influences. They may have a point because they say that it's how your family is. If your family taught you to be a certain way then you would grow up being that way because that's the way you grew up, but at the end of they day you are you. your family might've taught you to be a certain way but you can always change how you wanna be.

In conclusion, I believe that we choose our own character. I don't think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. We are our own character."
2265,A9A0D8CE21B4,"Some people says decisions should be make by our self, however others says you should make decisions fallowed by people who are more experts have more experiences and time to deal with hard decisions.

I support the idea that we should all make our own decisions because its our life we should know what's better for us for our future, however some people like to make decisions based on others people decisions they think they would do the same as others when they make the same choices that experts and experiences people make.

In one case i had to make a hard decision probably a life chancing decision i had to choose between staying at my country or come to U.S.A and have a better life or at least more opportunities at first i din'd know what to do i wasn't sure what would be the best or what wold be the consequences from a bad decisions i want it to ask people who has all ready make that decision what should i do what they think should be best for me but i didn't because that was my own choice a choice that no one else can make but me.

But their are some cases where decisions are not make by the person who the decision would affect like when youre a baby, or under the age parents are the ones who would make decisions for you they would do what they think is bets for you, and some times you may not agree with what they decided for you but in those cases is where people with more experiences and knowledge meant to know whats best for you.

However i think we should all be free of making our own decisions ether you want to make it by your self or you want others with more time and experiences to help or make your decisions, but people should be award of what they choice because every decision can gave a consequence and the only one who can make the right choice is you."
3892,FF6F91DC4170,"What would you do if you fail your online classes? Some schools now offer online classes to make the student's life easier. I do not agree with the schools that offer distance learning, because it could be difficult for students to understand the online notes or videos, the students always need a teacher to ask questions, and the student's parents need to pay internet at home. Also the internet is expensive and some parents can not afford.

First, it can be beneficial for the students to attend at school because there is more activities and sports, where they can have fun with their friends.

Also, the teachers are always there to help and explain better the subjects. From my own experience, I need to be with a teacher to understand what is the topic about, that helps me to pass my exams and my classes. Even thought, there is some teachers that are very strict and irritate the students but the teachers know that is beneficial for the students future.

Therefore, being at home the whole time it is so boring because the students need to be studding and not having fun. That is why some students cannot develop them knowledge because they do not take fresh air and entertain them minds with someone else. For example, my friend Generic_Name she is at the Community College and the teachers offer some online classes and she decided to take it. But now she is frustrating because she have to watch some boring videos and she have to take quizzes constantly. She told me that she miss all her friends and her classmates.

After all, certain student do not have their mind clear enough attending to school; now imagine how difficult would be for them to take online classes without a teacher. For example, Generic_Name was taking online courses because he got sick so he could not attend to school for one year. Then, he came back to school, he was so disappointed because he mist a lot of stuff from his subject. He had to stayed after school and he had to go to summer school. Well, so far I have not take online classes but I take my friends experiences that is not easy.

Finally, in my opinion is not a great idea that the students take online classes, if they want to move faster and achieve in the future.

Some teachers think that online classes is easier for the students, then attending to school because the students take them own time to study. But the consequences is when the students fail their subject and they had to take it again in school. ""The more the students attend to school. The smarter they grown.""                "
157,0BEB8F7F5A64,"First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.

I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.

In conclusion, i believe that from now on as we move forwards in life we shouldn't assume what the other person is like, and not to always rely on first impressions because they could always be wrong."
1636,7C4960DF5CB8,"I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework .

I hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3

pieces of homework .

Students could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A

. It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework . Other students that are cabelble of doing this work on there own but have a hard time turning the homework in on time and if the school had a afterschool club this it homework wouldnt be a problem .

In conclusion this club would be really good to have because homework is a big issue in alot of these schools and most students dont care or dont understand how much homework matters it matters so much you probly wonder. Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework ''BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER'' but it does and. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done ."
505,263C2C01BC08,"I disagree with extending the school days, because is too much for the students and teachers, also not fair for teachers to work more them they do, and finally not that good because all the other schools are going to get earlier. Having not much sleep can effect students grades and classwork, This can effect teachers also just like the students.

Students wouldn't feel that well with adding one and half hours to school, because they need to study and rest well. Adding all that time to school would effect after school activities, because students would not feel like they had much sleep or they did not study for something that is due for school the next day. Students would not feel well rested because they had to wake up at a early time and then coming back to school, after they come back from school students are looking forward for a nap but they can't because they have chores to do.

Another thing is that students would not have time to do their chores that their parents told them to do, because they have homework or have to go to their soccer, swim or gymnastic practice. Adding one and half hours to school would affect the students a lot with activities and school work and also their sleep.

One more thing this would effect teachers work because they have to leave school later then before. Also teachers wold not have much time with their family afterwards. Another thing is that teacher are going to have to work even more in their things for the classwork. It would also make it difficult for them because they are going to have to spend more time in school instead with their kids or family.

And this is why I strongly disagree with adding one and half hours to school days. "
2063,9B4EEAAB752E,"Ralph Waldo Emerson believe that ""to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else you not is the greater accomplishment."" personally i disagree only cause now a days most young adults, child, and teens prefer to be around the same individuals who act, talk and basically does everything the same exact way. Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma "

The technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human contact due to use of the technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. in my opinion there are more negative than positive effects about technology

One of a negative effect is. Play games without speaking. We should meet the person first than start to play with that person. instead of play via any web with someone that we do not know who is.

There is another negative effects, kids, and teenagers are able to be in contact with bad people. like kidnappers, this are bad people who take advantages of the technology attacking the most vulnerable in technology the kids make the kids feel confident, and feel they are their friend. there are pedophiles too, looking for kid and teenagers.

Also, because of the technology many frauds are occurring every day hackers stolen some of our personal information. Like our names, address, social security number, banks accounts information, and make frauds to companies.

In conclusion, I believe that the technology has many negatives effects in our social lives

It is bad for our kids, and our information in risk, I wish we could find a safety way to use it.  "
2613,C1CA798352BA,It can effect people in a good way by lighting up their day or just talking to people helps them. Doing small act of kindness can really help people by if they lost money and you found it and you gave it back that helps them or you clean their car for them that could mean a lot to the person. picking up trash can help the earth that why no matter how small act of kindness it is' it can still have a big impact on someone day. I think more people should start being kind to other. tell me this when someone is kind to you. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you that's kindness they were kind to come and help you. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it.

2252,A8BB150F53AB,"In my oppion, I think technologly is good for the world! Because you can comunicate with people that are far away. Even it's a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasn't made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasn't going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasn't going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time.

Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people!

Some people don't buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents aren't like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, that's why some parents don't let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they don't care whats happens around them. Like my parents didn't want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didn't even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didn't have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they don't have money to eat and they can't help out their children with their eduaction.

In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people don't speak your language you'll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that don't live with you.       "
1452,6FDAD6124B9E,"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.

My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.

I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their video's and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fan's are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music video's to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.

Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on."

1521,750AFA674F45,"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school,

not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students."

2027,98DE8992E379,"I'm agree because your first impression it will be the one that represent who you are and it will show your personality, and the people will judge you becauseyour aparience and your actitude, for example, when i was looking for a jod at chipotles restaurant for the first time, they where looking at me strange like i was a bad person or a criminal.

The next day i went to popeye's restaurant with different type of clothes, and they didn't look at me in a strange way, and that was because i was dressing properly, and because my friend tell me to dress better because in the first time when i went to chipotle i was dressing as a bad guy and that make me look inapropiate and i did get the job.

After that i went to chipotle restaruant just for fun to prove if my friend was right and he was, the people from chipotle didn't look at me in a strange way as the first time, i think it's because they didn't remember me but when the manager comes he said, ""hoo hellow you're back,"" then he leave.

The manager was the only person who remembers me and he did not change his opinion about me, i didn't care because by that time i did get the job at popeyes so i decide to leave out of there.

In conclution that day i learn that the first impresion metter and it could affect in your life."
1199,5CF895003869,"""Unless you try something beyond what you already mastered,you will never grow"" I agree with this argument because if people never try something new,they will never know if they choose the best option because never try. In my opinion be afraid is the worse thing in the world. In my experience afraid is the most thing that I feel stoped me because if I am afraid I never try something beyond things I have,even knowing that it can be better for me. Also if people try to do something new,they will learn more things than they already know. Keeping trying is the best option for all people in the world. Does not matter if they fail or they are wrong,and finally I agree with the statement because people will never know if they will get better opportunities in a job,college or in general life,if they never try or they never force theirselves to be successful.

First,if people never try something new,they will never know if the way they choose,was the best option because they will be always with the doubt thinking about what could happen if they were tried. They will never be brave enough if they never try to do something new because they are afraid. In my opinion the best example is when teenagers are in school,specially people who are from Central American countries,they are afraid because they do not speak the internacional language ""Enlglish"" so,they prefer do not try something like; speak with their classmates or even with their teachers,if they have any doubt they will never ask because they are afraid. They just do not want to try it because they are afraid classmates or teachers laugth about them,even when the teacher are good with them because some teachears are a kind of rude,not all of them but there are some of them. In my personal experience,the last year I had two teachers who was very rude with me and my friend. We were in our class when she asked for something that I did not understand and I asked her what was that,and she said that if we do not speak English we need to go back our conutry,and my other teachers was angry because in my class all the people was speaking Spanish and she said the same thing that my another teacher said before ""If you do not speak English just go baxk to your countries"". These are examples why teenagers are afraid to try new thins and they just prefer stay quite,but the only way to know how things are going to take place,is try it. If people try new things,they will be better person that they already are because they will figth for the things they want,they will be successful by theirselves.

Second,if people try to do new things,they will learn more things that they already know. When people try something new the results can not be always positive. They can fail,but at least they were brave to try something that they never try before and they have to be proud of theirselves even if they did not get what they want. However if they did not get what they want,they learned something new because people learn from the mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn because you will know what to do the next time that you try the same thing until you get what you want. Does not matter if you are wrong,you will learn because the life is a lesson that you learn every single day. In my experience when my uncle wants to get his license,we went to the DMV so many times but he always fail his test. We went to the DMV about five times till the day he pass his test,but he never give up even knowing that he can fail the last time we went,he wants to try it again and keeping trying still they have his license with him. So do not get frustrate if you do not get it the first time you try,just keeping trying,you will get it.

Finally,is people will never know if they will get better opportunities if they never try. So many people in the wolrd are looking for better opportunities but the most of the time they never get it,the only reason is because they never try. When people want to get a new job where they need to do something that they never did before they choose do not try it because they do not want to be wrong,but if they never try it,never will be better,never will get a best opportunity to be successful. Everybody is afraid about fail and fail is the most comun reason what people stop to doing something they want,but fail is not the worse thing in the world,the really worse thing is not try it. People can get better opportunities also in the college,they need to try something maybe the things can work good for them. Life is the best gift that we have,we can be sad,we can be happy,we can be whatever we want,and do whatever we want to do,but need to keep try it. If something does happened just like people want,keeping try it to get perfeccion. To get what they want,they need to force theirselves untill get and be who really want to be. Life is the best teacher we have. The life teach us be brave,be proud of ourselfs,be best person than we were yesterday,but life also teach us to figth to get better opportunities,and better lifestyle.

In conlcusion,try new things is better than stay with the things people already have. Try is the best option that people have,does not matter what poeple say about the way people decide to take,everybody is going to choose the best way for their lives. So keep trying,on that way you will mastering more things than you already have. Does not matter how good you are or how many things you already have. You need to looking for most better thing,better opportunities. People do not have to be afraid,people need to be brave to get what they want. Do not give up if the things do not take the place that you want,just keeping trying. Always will be better try new things,to continue grow up than stay where you are with the things you already have. Better life,better opportunities,best person in the world. I am very agree with the statement,and you need to be agree,too. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered,you will never grow""."
1485,728AD690E87F,"Dear principal I agree with the school cafeteria plans because our health would be better if we eat healthier than chunk food, It will makes us not get obese and fell into depression, healthier food makes your body be more active.

Does healthier food makes your health healthier?, is obesity a problem for students?.

Healthier food would make our health be healthier, Instead of eating chunk food we should eat healthier school lunch ,because If we eat healthier food it will be easier for us to do any sport because when we eat chunk food our stomach feels heavier than when we eat healthier food, professional athletes they maintain their shape because they always eat healthier food.

It will makes us not fell into depression, When we eat chunk food and we don't eat any healthier food it makes us get fat and when we can't stop eating it makes us go to the level that we get obese and when we get obese a lot of students fells into depression because they don't like that way they look after they weight increase.

obesity is a big problem for our health, because it can take you to the level that you will not be able to walk.

Healthier food makes students be more active, when we eat healthier our body don't feel to heavy so we are able to move faster than when we chunk food. Chunk food makes stomach heavier that after we eat it makes so lazy that we don't e want to do anything after lunch. Healthier food activates our brain like when we do exercise we activate our body .

In conclusion i think it's a great idea this new plan, changing the school menu into healthier food because it will make our health be healthier, It will help us not fell into depression, It will make us be more active. healthier food is the best the school cafeteria can do for us because they will help us prevent obesity and they will help us take care of our health."
3894,FF76D397A73C,"Not all the types of success have to be kind of hard to reach...sometime you just have to give a look in what are you good in one thing.

According to the Minister Wistom Churchill from Britain about the phrase tha he said

""Success consits of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiam""

is 50% percent true and 50% percent wrong.

For example a person who reached the success in hard way is the now trending disigner of the brand

""Off-White""

he said on a nterview that ""it wasn't easy to be in here that I'm now you know?"" cause when ll this started I didn't had help so i find my own help with the company/brand Nike to use some of they sneakers to make my shoes design come true, i didn't have the answer of they in one day- NO! I tried and tried to get one response until one day that they say ""Yes we're working together, you can use all of our sneaker desing to make your work"". Now the colaboration between Nike and Off-White in a trending colab now in these days.

This example is a hard way to reached the success but now we are going to see two cases of ""easy success""

Two exampe of ""Easy succes"" are the actress Natalie Portman and the Ex-Proffessional Boxer Mike Tyson,they got their success cause they are naturally borned talented.

For Example the case of Mike Tyson, he was a 12 years old fighting in the streets to gain some money for his family till one day a man saw him fighting with an older boy with him in which fight Mike won, the man saw in Tyson a potential legend in the world of the Box.

Another caseis the case of the famous actress Natalie Portman, she has been a talented actress since she was a little girl. One day a friand of her mother told to Natalie to make a try to win a paper in a Hollywood movie in which Natalie won because she was naturally born a proffessional actress, she just make her future with her talent.

In conclusion not all the success people made their success with blood, sweet, and tears, some of them just were talented or used their pros to be somebody important in this world."

1) the older students can help and teach the younger one who to behave in the class and they can make a good effed tried to teach them.

2) the younger students learn form the older one so they can learn form them.

3) if they learn they can teach the more youngest or the new kid by doing that the bad part

1) the bad part of this is that the youngest can get in trouble if they go whit the kid that don't behave correct in the class.

2) they can get in trouble if they miss behave and be whit the wrong people in the school.

3)

some people want to make trouble and can make the younger kid in a big trouble by teach them bad behave.

1001,4CFAF19AF547,"Technology has it ups and downs with some being useful to use humans and some being harmful and destructive. Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we don't even need it because we're to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on people's lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things.

In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. That's when kids want to isolate themselves and don't go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they don't even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and don't even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on people's life and causes them to have depression.

Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that it's not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life.

Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing it's just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital.

In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. It's usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People don't even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but it's only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home.

Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we don't even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on people's lives because can cause people to lose they're touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and people's physical or mental health. So, technology can be ignored but it will never go away."
897,450A7F9AC54A,"It was wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing for our gale or accomplish. I personally agreed with the "" Thomas Jefferson wrote.

"" Determine never to be idle"" It is not good when you are not doing much work. Don't be un idle.

I support my idea with several reasons.

First of all,

I personally agreed with the Thomas Jefferson wrote. If you use your time properly,time is very important in your life you will be productive day use your time. For example I must be weak up in the morning do my exercise every day. I will be healthy It is very important when you have a good healthy. After that you will be managing your time for the hole day by firshing your time. Then I go on time my school. Because to have a good skill is very important. ""knowledge is a power"" I will get my a good education. Also, I go to my job and make my money in the mean time. For this reasons when use your time that will be a good productive day makes you happy. I heat to be seat and watching TV all day and play game.

Second, I am very happy for making some one happier or helping.

Because on my extra time I always go to the library and working as a voluntary helper for some people need help. Also, what ever i have information I shard with people and give a good information then make them happier.

In addition, I always go with the alimentary school when they have school trip.

Helping for the teacher. Especially, working with the kids it is fun and having a good time when i help the kids it make me happy.

Third, you will be a successful and accomplish your life. When you work hard you will be have a good life for the rest of your life. At the same time all your family have a good life. In addition, Life is short you need to be work hard don't be rune slowly it is good to be not idle. The more you work the more get success.

Eventhough, some times have a difficult time never give up you have to be strong and continue do some thing. Also, when you have a bud habite avoid as soon as a possible to be a successful person.

Incounuclsion, It was wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing the right way.

It is not good running slowly or not doing much work.

you should be work hard and discipline for every thing. That's way I agree with the wonderful Idea ' Thomas Jefferson wrote'

""Determine never to be idle."
1062,516E5D64BF6E,"I think that people make their own decisions is technique good. I agree with that for 2 reasons. people have to improve their lifes without help and guidance. People know which is the best decision by themself.

First reason, people have to improve in their lifes without help or guidance. The people have to be indepentdient, also the people have to follow their directions.

Additionally, people know which is the best decision by themself. The people have the responsability to improve their lifes or not, and the people will assume their own responsability if their decisions are bad.

Some people would argue that people don't have knokledge to have a good decision,and they do not have a guidance to follow; however, the people do not have all the time good decisions sometimes the pople choose bad decisions, and the people do not has to have a guidance to follow.

It's clear that people can make their own decisions. I strongly believe that people have the best decisions by themself, and people have to improve in their lifes without help or guidance."
1637,7C54D7484145,"I think students should not be required to take a arts class . students have the rights to take the classes they want to take . If they like arts classes they are free to take that class . but students that don't like art class do not have to take the class .

For example i really don't like arts classes but i'll still take the class because at my school they do this thing that if we need to retake a curse class then we well have 25% of taking that class or if we don't need a curse class we had the 50% of taking that . It might be the same in some schools or it might be different it others schools. some kids may not like the idea of taking art classes and some may like the idea .

Kds may want to have space to take the class they want and they can't because they are required to take arts class . Like they want to take gym or something like this but i know that some boy's would not like this idea . If some kids do enjoy painting or acting . but some kids do not like acting or painting . They might think that it's boring for them to be in that class .

I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they don't like the class or something like this . That's why im saying that arts classes should not be required to take .

I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class .

it's really the best thing to do in my thinking . Because look at it like this if kids that don't like drama and they don't let the teachers teach because they do not wanna be there . they want be in another class that they really want to be

. that's another thing that teachers have to go though dealing with rude kids .

This concludes my argument about students having to take arts classes . this is for all schools please let your kids to pick their classes . or at least give them one class that they like . like i said at first i really don't like this argument thats happening .     "
2585,BFB53ACD3DD5,"Have you asked to your-self what might people think about you or what impressions they have about you? That's a hard question to answer, but I guess everybody does it. First impressions not always are positive for our-selfs, it can make you doubt about your-self, look for people's approval, and get a low-esteem. First impression not always come into your life with good intentions.

As first point, first impressions make you overthink what to do and what to say, making you doubt about your-self, and loosing your confidence. Nobody should wonder what others think about them, because each person have their own life and their own problems.

In high schools, mostly the 90% of students look for the approval of their friends. Teenagers are the most affected. Essentially, this teenageers do not have their own life.

In facts, first impressions affect all people but mostly the teenagers. They get a low-esteem, all because the system in what now we life, first impressions.

I remember my first year of high school, I was afraid like a little chicken as we said in my country with no idea what to do or what to say, wonderig what they were thniking about me. There were a few days that I din't want to go to the school because I could felt tha the other students had bad impressions about me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "
1045,4FD4CE18CCDF,"I think seeking multiple opinions would be better, because you can actually view multiple perspectives and then decide which one is the best. For example, you can make a list of pros and cons to see which one you like the most. Or, you can take a vote on what to do. You will also be able to listen better and be more supportive of other people. You will as well as compromise better with multiple people rather than one specific person.

For example, let's say someone wants a dog. He or she is going to have to listen to many people's opinions about having a dog. One person could say, ""Having a dog is a very big responsability. So don't get one unless you ready to take on the risks for it."" Another person could say, ""It's really easy to own a dog. All you have to do is feed it, wash it, play with it, take it out on a walk, and clean it's mess."" After he or she listens to both people, he or she makes a pros and cons list and decides which side has more and which one is the best.

Another example, someone wants to play a sport, but it can be too dangerous. One person says, ""Don't do it. It's not worth risking your life and slowly dying in the hospital."" Another person says, ""Do it! It's not only fun, but it can also help you be more cooperative and you are being active."" Again, someone can agree with both answers, so that's why people need to compromise, to both get what they want.

One example of a compromise, you want to watch the new movie

Billy Madison.

However, you are underage. It can work out if you ask someone if he or she has ever seen the movie. If yes, ask he or she if there's any scene okay for your age. If yes, you will probably be able to only watch the movie once. Otherwise, you are goind to have to wait until you're at the age.

Another example is, you want to stay up. However, your parents never let you. You can talk to them and see if they can let you stay up for at leat just one night. If you're lucky, you will probably be able to stay up during the weekend. But never on a school night.

That's why I think seeking advice from multiple people is a better choice. Not only it will help you more, but, it can also teach you how to deal with real-life situations. Also compromising and making a list will help you with that. It will as well teach people how to listen better and be more supportive of others. Then you decide whether if it's right or wrong. "
1252,607A39D981DE,"Students and their families should consider any activitie that they want to get involved in school before getting in. If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also won't be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have.

First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school.

If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities.

If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities.

Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didn't understand in the class.

I think Schools should not control students involvents.

Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students. When students are responsible with their shool work, and their activities, they should get extra credit.      "

''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. Try to be better, and learn things that we don't know is the only way to grow. Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good. Having always family's motivation to keep going up, and for our learning proces. Learn from our mistakes, to grow as a person and never say never to anthing is a goog meaning of grow. For these reason i think we have to learn something beyond wath we have already mastered.

Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good, to grow. Meny people practise new different sports, to learn somethings new. take clases in the school, that we never taked to improve as a student. Have a different job, where we can improne our workers skills. For these reasons and many hothers i think try new things can help to grow and improve and what we have already mastered.

Having always family's motivation is the best support and our learning process. many people always try to think about this word ''family'' because, is the word that give averyone power to keep giong. Motivation to be learning, to help our familis is a big example of grow. Help others can have a big meaning end the others persons and for you too. For these reasons and many others i think having family's motivation is the best support and our learning process.

Keep learning from our mistakes, is the best way to grow as a person. When we try to learn something and so many times we make a lot of mistakes, that mean that something good is coming. Some people like to make correction to help, and that is one of the best wat to improve. Never say never, always keep going because that's way the mistakes exist, becuse we learn from them. For these reasons and any others, keep learning from out misrakes, is the best way to grow as a person.

In conclution, i am agree with Ralph Emerson Wrote. We have to try to do something beyond what we have already mastered. Trying new things to be better on things that we are already good. Having always family's motivation. Keep learning from our mistakes. This are many raison to be agree with Raph Waldo Emerson wrote and, if we want to grow we have to learn somethings new."
1627,7B6FA03518AE,"People who does not have patient cannot make an experience without helping from someone else, and a project is not hard to make, but you have to think about what you are going to say in the project.

There are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. Sometime you have to force yourselfe to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future.

For this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it. If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You could have done something that you had to do. You have to check it, so to make sure it is good or not good, so that is the way you can learn from your mistakes.

Most of the time, you feel like you cannot do anything all you can do is just sleeping that does not mean you will never grow. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things and you never do something wrong. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it. In life, you suppose to have done the right things to continue with the others."
2657,C495D1E686C0,"From my point of view, this is a good idea because most students have a different situation in their life. Sometimes, they woud like to become an independent person, so nobody can coerce to do something even their parent. In my eyes, it is not important that the students finish high school in three year or four year. After graduating from high school, they are a good person, aren't they?. I think this is a most important problem. To me, the students should be a good citizen because the society needs them to develop. A good behavior is more necessary than graduation, and they have to practise or use the lesson that were learned in high school, so they will get a lot of experience.

The life is an adventure, discovery, and study. Day by day, everything is changing rapidly. Due to this problem, the student not only study in textbook, or document but also learn from substantial. When we face up with difficult problem, it gives us more valuable experience in the life, i think this experience is too hard to find in book, or school. If you graduate in high school early it will give you more time to learn new things from your life, so you will grow up and have a lot of opportunities to success in life. For instance, Generic_Name who i admired, was a founder the Coffee Shop Company in my country. He was still graduate high school early and then i worked for his company. At that time, he was learning how to grow a special coffee, which is the only one not only in vietnam but also over the world. At the present,

his company is the best coffee company in Vietnam. He said to me that difficulty, experience are the keys to success. Actually, the life is a challenge: it isn't easy to you. If you would like subdue it you have to prepare everything as soon as you graduate high school. Therefore, the student finish high school early; it is very neccessary to prepare for new challenges in the life.

As we can see, the economy is delicated and various, so you have more time to find an occupation which is suitable for you. I believe that 50% senior were confusing about their future because most of their time is in school, class, which forgot going ouside to expand your knowledge and doing some part-time jobs to get new lessons. In my opinion, most of people fall down in their life because of lacking of experience.

In short, i support this idea because it make us mature, independent. Besides, we have more chance to success and to do new things. It's also a good way to demonstrate your ability"
254,12796C5A0480,"Desagree,because to select yes the to taste to participe in an activity ,what no effort in the that no to select for example pay a sport and to arrive to hurt. a estudent has decide that sport play and to know the it that game, they decide to understand and to have a good time,to be acquainted with more people have more friends, weight control,check health,to control the sentiment.

To know and to learn much more things , to surpass whole every day ,to throw out desire every second,to understand or to quastions if to want learning to find to avail oneself of the right moment to find that all himself to again ,not to matter if is difficult or easy never to determine that is impossible.

never to surrender because if one all the propose ,sole is to want to learn and to againg ,for example to want to learn play a sport if himself the to propose play sport, and every day to surpass. Not himself to need that east obliged.

They to know that if not participate in the working as task in the rating. if to need to find on the theme power to quastions and to understand."
3644,F53B14C7F455,"One topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school don't have any experience of any career.

I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career.

As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career."
684,34A066E69905,"There are two types of working. one of them is workinng with a group, another one is working individually. Although some people prefer to work alone. I belive it is so much better to work in a group. If we compare these two working types, the benefits of group work are more then those working alone.

Firstly, I prefer to work in a group because group work allow a person to work according to his or her strength, since the the group members apply their strong side to the work, the completion time will be faster. For instance, I was involve in a car desgin project several years ago. one person made engineering calculation to understand which parts are critical for our design, I made the drawings of the car components, and another friend of mine made the presentation for our project, then he present it to the teacher, He gave us a good respond and additional points since we completed our work before the due date. to be more precise, we did a great job, because we devided the work according to our strong sides.

Another reason why I prefer to work an a group is that I think that this type of work establishes a stonger relationship between the group members. As humans, sociallzation it important for us and working with a group give us a chance to improve our relationship. when people are in a group, they have to communicate with each other at each step of the process. for example, in our last year elective course, I made new friends becaude we were involved in a group project together. Thankds to the project, we did build a great relationship among each other, and we are still in touch.

lastly, group work improves the sense of responsibility. All group members are aware that their perperformance effects the group, so all group members try to do their best and work hard to get better results. For example, A few years ago, some of my friends and I participated in a competition which was related to optimization. since there was a lot of thing to do, we devide the topics among each other. we did not have enough information about one of the shared parts. however, a person who got that subject made a lot of effort to learn the topic well. He attended online course and read books related to that field. Eventualy, he accomplished it and did a great job. what I'm trying to say is that in a group work, even if a person does not have enought information related to his or her working area, he or she may learn things with his or her effort becuse he or she knows that a miskake will cause negative outcomes.

In conclusion, working with a gruop makes things more easier and helps make the group member work more happily. If we take the info account to all these factors, we may reach the conclousion that working in a group has more advantages than working alone."
1885,8E2EB0B4B92C,"The author Ralph waldo Emerson once wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Many people may agree with that, but there are also others who may disagree with his saying. I think would agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, one because you don't have to worry what others think of you. Two, you feel relieved not pretending to be someone or somethings you aren't. Last but not least three, people can see the real you.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because one, you don't have to worry what others think of you. Being yourself will most likely help you boost your confidence. If you worry about what other people think you will probably be stressing trying to become something you aren't. Think about what Ralph Waldo Emerson one wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""

"" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" This a quote that Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote. People may agree or disagree everyone has there own opinion. I however agree with his quote because, if your being yourself you'll feel relieved not pretending to be something or someone you aren't. Sometimes pretending to be someone or something you aren't can stress you out because you feel pressured. You feel like you need everyone to like you but will you feel good about yourself pretending.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, the author who wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Why do most people agree with his quote, there could be many reasons. My reason to agree with Ralph's quote is because people can see the real you when being yourself. Not being yourself around your family, friends, and other people could make you feel less confident about yourself or your actions. Pretending can make you feel guilty, it could make you feel like you're lying to someone about yourself, so think about it.

The author Ralph waldo Emerson once wrote "" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" As I said many people agree and many disagree we are all entitled to our own opinions. If you ask me I completely agree with his quote because, one you don't have to worry what others think of you, two you feel relieved not pretending to be someone or somethings you aren't, and three people can see the real you. Become yourself or do what make you feel comfortable. Think to yourself, before choosing whats best for you."
3605,F3604BAC5D79,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want.

The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish.

Churchill's statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it.

The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves.

I agree with Churchill's statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real.

Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job.

In conclusion, the Churchill's statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success."
620,2EEEE9C5E227,"Are first impressions impossible to be changed? It has been said that they are almost impossible to change. Most people tend to agree with this statement, but what if they are wrong? I personally disagree and believe that there are ways to make impressions change. It's all about giving the person the opportunity to show and see who they really are.

First impressions are judgments we made before getting to know the individual. These impressions can be on favor or against the person being judge. Thinking on ways to make these impressions change, I have found some good ways and these can be; getting close to the person, asking to their close friends about them, asking teachers or other adults. All this based on my life term experiences.

Getting close to the person meaning; talking to them personally, this could make a big change on the impression been transmitted the first time you saw the person. By talking to the person you will find so much things and probably things of your interest. When talking to a person you are making judgments in your head, but your mind always changes from what you thought this person was before.

Asking to their close friends about them is a risky but also a good idea. Their friends know them better and can provide a good opinion on them. When asking their friends, you should make a comparation on all of their opinions, this would help to know this person's circle. Social circles are very important and most of the time define a person's being. Knowing this person's circle will change that first impression on their social side.

Asking teachers or simply community adults will help a lot to change that first impression. Maturity level is something we always judge when comes to impressions. Teachers will tell you what is this person attitude at school. Community adults will tell you how does this person behaves on their everyday living. Whether you find it positive or negative, opinions definitely make the first impression change.

People say that first impression only last a very short moment, therefore it can't be change because it's just flash judgment on a person. On the other hand we have people like me that believe that as long as you have not contact with that person's circle, you are still in the first impression and it can be change. Getting to know an individual, Talking to their friends, and others adults' opinions are all first impression changers.

Overall first impressions are possible to be change and we need put these steps on play. If we would to follow these steps we would not be hating on each others and will live in a better world."
1257,60D8EB883A45,"CAN WE ACCOMPLISH BY ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING OR NOT DOING SOMETHING

Can people accomplish by always doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Do we accomplish more if we are always not doing something productive? No, being inactive won't help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing. Although, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. People would learn more things, meet new people to achieve goals in life and how much can be done if we are always doing something.

People would learn more things if they are more productive. I remember when my mom signed me up for a soccer team. I didn't know I was going to be joining a soccer team, or wanted to play on the soccer team;however, I did it and I learn how to kick a soccer ball, how to be a golly and I improved my speed. Another example was when I had a vocabulary test for English but I didnt know half of the vocabulary words, so I study till I learned the words.

Meeting new people to achieve a goals. I like being a indoor person, but when soccer season comes and I join a team I interact with new people and coaches to achieve my goals on how to become a better teammate or how I can improve my speed and mentality to become a great soccer player. Another example was when I talked to a new math teacher to help me on a equation I didnt understand. he helped me understand the equation, and helps me every time I need help on something in math now.

Imagine how much can be done if we are always doing something. people would be able to accomplish so many goals if we are always doing something instead of staying home and laying down and watch TV all day. when we get some free time we can work on something that would help us in the future and make us think better. Maybe when we think we dont need help, but actually do ask someone to help you to understand more instead of staying with the same mindset.

Although, some people maybe don't got that much time to accomplish things. Thats why they go inactive but still accomplish their goal on a long term time. Inactivity also can also serve a purpose, depending on the person maybe they dont got money or a transportation vehicle to get to their destination. Although, they can't just do nothing and wait for something good to happen to them.

People can accomplish their goals by always doing something that would helped them in the future. Thomas Jefferson wrote,''Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" People would learn more things, meeting new people to achieve a goal and how much can be done if we are always doing something productive. Although being inactive won't help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing.                   "
846,40E6BC53EC01,"Just imagine you have an important basketball game at your school. Since you have three hours to get to the school, you decided to go watch a movie with some friends. When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end,

that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports.

First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell

Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home.

Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure,

materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school.

Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health.

Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport."
2184,A33D66485059,"Tomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonerful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

In this prompt I thinki that Tomas Jefferson was triying to said is that people have to determinate to never be idle to always do something, because after that you will see how much things you may done, and there always 2 types of people . The pople who would be agrere or not agree with this frase. That is why some people may think that is not always necessary to do something or work hard for things that we want, because they think that we can work for our things when is their necessary time . Also some people may think that you need to do something when things are really necessary or when you want something. I hardly believe that the frase that Tomas Jefferson wrote is totally true. We need always been working in our life to get wonderful thing , as he said is wonderful how much we can done whit things if we are always doing something for it. It is also that we that he worote that sentences, because I can totally feel how he specificly said "" Determinate never to be idel "" I take that sentence like never let yourself be that.

In the world are so many people negative that always think that we cannot get that things that we want that is always the reason why people become lazy with their dream , because they always think with negativily.

there are many people outside looking for a excuse to be idle.

In conclusion I hardly believe that I'm totally agree with Tomas Jefferson because we can keep working or doing something because after that, we would see the things that we have done or our resuts that our hard work. Just we need to keep doing something or working for something great in our future as a person succeful that we want to be."
3477,EDA3FF6D2DCA,"This is true for me ""example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."". If you talk someone for one thing, information, film, music, game, ... Best support for your idea is examples. I think is the only thing for support your idea. You don't have other options But never mind you have a one more way for influence others everybody know this way because is the best way of everything it is the money.

Once upon a time me and my friend talking about one film (i did not remember the film name know.) we are saying only examples (because we know is the best way for support our ideas) he is saying one example i am saying another and we are talking like a 30 or 35 min finally i gave up and i said if you accept my idea i will buy a large size pizza and he said OK.

After for this conversation i learned example and money is not the main thing influencing others; it is the only thing

.

386,1D47271C213D,"The students must be self- confident in order to succeed. I agree that hard work helps to build self-esteems because students must have faith in their own abilities, they have to learn from their mistakes, and be proud of them achievements. That's why students can not be conform with insufficient work just to be admired by teachers or parents. Also, to able to be successful always needs high standards.

Even though, parents and teachers decide to praise the students by giving them gifts or other things. It can motivate the students but there is some days were people are not in a good mood and forget to praised the students. That's how students can't continue with the same motivation and loose confidence. For example, my Probability Statistics math class she used to gave us candy every single day so we never try to do our classwork, everybody failed her class.

Several students make mistakes while they are trying to accomplishing something and they give up when they don't have an easy solution. In reality that is when they are used to be treated with extreme indulgence. Of course, it doesn't matter how many mistake they make; it matters to continue believing in them self. Eventually, my friend Generic_Name came from Generic_City, she used to go to

Susbury University it was difficult for her to learn English she also failed three classes. But she did not care how many times she failed. She believe in herself and she achieved her goal now she is an ESL teacher.

How does people becomes doctors or professionals? some people don't have their parents alive or they are far away from each other so they don't have nobody to praised them. From my opinion, they should be proud of them self. All the effort, dedication, passion for the school and they don't need somebody to award them to be trust. But also, it's not easy for the students to succeed in this world unless they want to work for it. Everybody can notice when they gain something beneficial for their life and be satisfied with them great effort. From my own experience, my biology teacher it was very strict that she screamed at my face the first day of the semester but I showed her that I'm better what she thought I was. So I passed her class with an average of 80 and I also passed the SOL.

Finally, when the students are comfortable from what they already accomplished, it's when they have a great opportunity to build them self-esteems. They do not need to be pushed with emotional things to able to be confident, If they get emotional later on, they wouldn't be able to continue without being praised. Some people do not survive when they don't get to achieved, then they complain on someone who don't give presents. Self-esteems always comes from achievements never comes from praising. "
3585,F22B25257E47,"Two minds think better than one. Working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it.

Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. However, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. Because, they are helping each other. When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely.

When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. Even other students would prefer to be there.

Many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together. But many people are looking where they can work with people from different types of cultures and listen every idea or opinions in life. having someone to work with, can make evening easier than working alone. Every teacher should allow or try to create a better place where students feel comfortable. "
3387,E91F2E8986B2,"If you master a subject you like and dont try pushing your limits you wont succeed.

Why wouldnt you want to push your limits?

Theirs a reason why people get stuck in life, when they master their subject.

They get fustrated when they can't find jobs or good pay wage.

I agree on what Author Ralph Waldo Emereson because if you dont have that motivation on what you master it can affect you.

If you dont push yourself into doing more than beyond than life will not treat you as you wanted.

I agree on Author Ralph because I've experience things in life that if you dont try on something , than you wont be able to grow.

If you look at bill gates he master on his program and what did he do he share his product and open stores. He grew just by mastering his program. My experience was mastering in learning how rebuild a engine from just the block to how to make more power. Now im fixing peoples cars and doing tunes for their cars.

I know these guys that called themself diesel brothers. They are master diesel technician. So what did they do? They bought a shop , got a crew and got sign to do a tv show. They work on diesel trucks, diesel cars and anything that is diesel. Then they decided to do custom trucks and custom military cars. That wasn't enough for them, so they came up with ideas to use military axles and putting them on custom trucks making those trucks so heavy duty they can even pull a train!

My father told me that you should never stop, even if you reach that goal. He said,"" you reach that goal make another goal, you can't stop at what your doing and if you do,than theirs going to be bumps in the road and than your going to make huge mistakes."" just from those words it's like million bucks to me. Why because if you stop at what you master ,than somebody is going to master it better than you ever thought and your not going to grow from it.

When they master their subject, those people get happy right but whats next? Lets say you master your subject and than you find a job that pays good. The money looks good and you stay at that job for a couple of years. I'd say that probably 75 percent of you staying at that job will make your miserable. People get bored and can't find nothing else to do,but do the exact samething over again. It's going to make you want ot quit and find something else to do. Then once you quit your job what's going to be in your mind? Probably nothing at the moment,but then your realize that you master that subject and want to share it, make it to your own business and improve from it.

So I do agree on what Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote. I believe that if you dont go beyond your goal than you wont succeed in life. So make sure that you push yourself even if its harder. I promise you that you will succeed,have better thought, better examples and freedom. Remember having to do more you will get more in return.     "
805,3E6C6F1FE64D,"Imagine going to school and it's your first day back from summer vacation and you walk into class with a weird impression that some teachers want to change because they know you can change the way you act or talk to other people. I think first impressions can be change because there are people that struggle to show how they feel so they have this mean impression towards people the cause of it might be parents divorce a lot and a family member passing. Some resources say that 50 percent of the population tend to give students or parents an impression that is either showing how they feel towards something.

Firstly, changing an impression might be a challenge for some people but they said its impossible to change in my reasoning I think it's possible to change someones first impression. You really can't give someone an impression if you don't know anything about them or if you don't know them. You can't always say ""oh their so mean"" until they know your background. The reason I say that is because most of the time it's true most people would give an impression towards new students at school, but they don't know anything about the person. In reality, I disagree with first impressions are almost impossible to change because you can change that impression that people tend to have on there face.

Secondly, there are other ways you can show your impressions if you don't want to show them. The first one is that you need to try to befriend them and make a conversation you never know you and that person might have a lot in common that you just didn't know to begin with. Your impression doesn't judge but it's the way you show it because sometimes it led to making new friends, having good grades, and making your own decisions in life sometimes.

Thirdly, I think impressions can change because nobody said anything about ""anything isn't impossible "" but a lot of stuff is possible if you believe there is. My reasoning to this prompt is that if you don't try hard enough to change the impression you have on your face then how can you make friends or how can you ignore what people are saying about you . Everyone can change especially their impressions you just keep trying and get to know the person.

In conclusion, I think first impressions can be change if you act right towards people and how you treat others with your impression. Nothing is impossible if your don't try to change it or if you don't try to make a way to get people to be on the same level as you in the end. So I totally disagree with this prompt for saying that first impressions are almost impossible to change. "
2340,ADF1112226F4,"Do you agree with Albert Einstein when he said ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I think that is true because if you have now imagination than how are you going to get knowledge. I agree because Albert Einstein had to have a strong imagination to become really smart, Albert Einstein lived through a lot so he knows a lot, Elbert Einstein is smart.

To begin with, I think that Elbert Einstein had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest human beings to ever live. He was really smart that is why I think he said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he had to have a strong imagination to think and become really smart. Elbert Einstein created and invented a lot of thing and to make to things he needed a strong imagination.

In addition, Elbert Einstein was really old and really smart so he lived through a lot as a human not as genus. He also learned a lot from being a genus but he did live through a lot and he was a human.

Also, I think that Elbert Einstein created cool inventions and gadgets from his imagination he needed a wild imagination to think and create a lot of cool things that is most likely why he said this quote. He was smart but he used his imagination too.

In conclusion, I agree with what Elbert Einstein said because he had a strong imagination because he was one of the smartest people, he lived through a lot, he was really smart. I think you should agree too because you can use your imagination to become a genus at you school, job or even your house o with your family. Use your imagination."
2777,CB892FB55B59,"How do you want people to see you as a good or a bad person? In my personal opinion I want to be the good one; to make it happen I have to show the best of me at the first time. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, I think that it is true. There is no second impression, once is enough to show the kind of person that you are. There are three reasons why I agree. I will not be the person that no one would like to believe in, I will not get help from anyone, and I will not have friends.

To begin with, I will become the person that no one would like to believe in. For example, if I show myself as a liar at the first impression, everyone will know that I am not the one or the incorrect person to believe in. Even though I am saying the truth no one would trust me, but the first impression can change it. My mom told me that doing the best since the begining will help me the rest of my life. She was right because of what she thought me, and I apply it in my life I see myself as the person who you can believe in.

Secondly, I will not get help from anyone. In my life I will need help from others because I am not able to do everything by myself. That's why I should make people to see me as a helpful person at the first impression, otherwise I will not get help. I heard someone said that ""what I give to others is what I will recieve back from them"".

What I understood is that if I do not help others, they will not help me. I always like to be the kind of person that help without waiting something back. I think that it makes my impression as a good one.

Finally, I could lose friends or I would not have any friends what is even worst. Since the first time when I

met my friends and showed them that I am the type of person or friend that is always with them no matter what. Furthermore, I have never betreyed one of them but if I've would did it when we met, they already kick me out of their life. As I said before one of the things that can make me the best friend is my first impression, show them that I am loyal.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, you can change them but it takes a long time and you will lost your patience waintig until it change. That's why giving a good first impression will prevent problem for you such as; to not become the person that no one would like to belive in, to not get help from others, or to not have friends. A simple good impression would make your life better or would make your life worst."
2640,C38334385924,Their are some schools that offer to attend online classes or video conferencing what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class. Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents. They like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time. Same thing with there schedule when you have classes at home you can choose the time and day that you want to do the class.             
1301,63C74FF7DB27,"Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we don't undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals.

The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant.

Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant.  "
2030,992ED17DB3CA,"The benefits of having a good attitude

There are a lot of benefits because of having good attitudes, we can get more time to make again what we were doing and do not stop until we make it the best we could.

In other way, been with a good attitude can help us improve in life that helps us to learn, to concentrate and, to be a good thinking of someone else.

Also, something kind of the same happened to me some time ago when my father was teaching me how to drive, and every time I did something wrong he yelled at me and one day I was with a really bad attitude because of that and than I realized that been mad was not going to help me so i changed my attitude and i learn to drive really fast.

Been mad only makes us worst at doing that because we are not thinking about the positive thinks of that activity just at the negative thinks and thats what makes everything worst.

The benefits of having good attitude its that it can help us to try again something we miss, been frustrated only makes us waste our time and, also having that good attitude makes us improve a lot."
2725,C87D8E9C6248,"When older student work with smaller students, it can make friends, it can also help smaller student and older student.

When older student and smaller student work together it can make friends because both student have to work together so they have to listen and talk to each other, so they can be friends. When they talk to each other they can learn more about the other person like they can know what they like or what they don't like. So they can learn a lot from each other. It mean that when you make friend it can help the smaller kids.

It can help the smaller kid because they can uderstand better about the lesson because they know then if they don't understand something someone is gonna to help them to understand. They can say their opinion because ththe older and smaller student do not have a lot of different age like could have 4 or 5 years old more then tem so that is not a lot, so it can be easyer to the small kid to explain you what their opinion is. They can also ask a question when they want because sormely they have to wait that the teacher is finish an other student to ask the question but if there are also older student which alredy do the lesso you can ask them your question. The work by different age help the small kid but it can also help the old kid.

It can help the old kid because it help them to stay calm to do not be in stress, because with small kid you have to dpeak slow and do not be angry because they do not understand you are saying. If they understand what you are saying it mean that you have to find an other way to explain it like speak cleerly with simple words because don't know all the long and difficult word. The older student have maby forget this lesson so they can relearn the less at the same time then the small kids, but it will be easyer for the older student because he will remenber quicly. So when the small and big kid work together it can creat benefits and it can help the both of the student.

So when older student work with smaller students, it can make friends, it can also help smaller student and older student. So I realy think it is importante for the small and old kid to work together, because they both have benefits to do it.                "

I want to visit Japan because it's a place famous for their culture, tradition, advanced cities, technology and food. Japan is a place where all animes are created. Their famous food ""Sushi"" is also an reason for me to visit Japan. This food is liked by many people all over the world.

Once I reach there, I will explore all the major cities, eat their famous dishes and watch the anime which is famous over there. I will also try to learn Japanese and understand their tradition and culture. Another reason why I want to visit is because, Japan ranks at Top 10 for having low crime rates in the world and Japan ranks Top 5 for being a busiest country in the world.

I've seen many YouTubers making video of their stay in Japan and how they enjoyed staying there. Those videos are an another reason for me to visit Japan. I also want to enjoy those amazing moments like they did.

2583,BFB07811C92D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience.

Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control.

The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you don't have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. Is almos all the time happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable.

The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation,

for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if I'm dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now.

I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling don't show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life.

Introduction:

We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesn't have enthusiams they worry about to other people.

People who have enthusiams:

They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy.

They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment.

They can help to other person who need help.

They can to be the best in everything.

They can to be happy to ther people who are tired or sad.

People who doesn't have enthusiams:

If you doesn't have enthusiams, you can not do anything.

How you can help to other person if you doesn't have your own enthusiams.

If your enthusiams is bad, don't be alone.

If you don't have enthusiams, you doesn't wants to do anything.

Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

No, I'm not agree whith him because, if we failure and failure everytime again, so we enthusiams go to down, but if we failure just one time and the next time we are more preparate, is almost same that happen to me the day nobvemver 19, 2018,

that for see the hour from my phone, some people think that I did cheat in the SOL, but I doesn't need do that for pass this SOL.

Conclusion:

The bad enthusiams not just affect one person, that affect to the people who are in the around because if we can transmit cheerfulness to the other person and the other size the coin, other people can transmit the bad enthusiams I think so, so the person who have a good enthusiams they try to help to the other people. Winston Churchill with that he said, I understand that thing; That person whos failure and failure, are the person more strong because each failure they return more strongers and they do the best job.

1657,7DC02C918305,"It has been said that a positive is the key to success in your life.

be positive in your decisions is the most important for any goals or dreams that you want to do, its important make sure of each thing before do it because sometimes just take decisions for other people say and this do that dont believe in yourself, however always you have to think about what i want to do? or what i want to be? and think about the achieve for you future and believe in yourself, be positive is the begin to carry up big dreams in your life.

for example when i start the school i was so positive but same time negative because i dont know anyone, the language also but always you have one reason to do something and i have one reason thats my son, i was positive about what i want and what are my goals,the time past very fast; i found people important in my life, my friends they always are positive and this help yourself. When i talk with my friends i feel positive also because they make me feel like that, so now it's my last year and i feel good and this is the point to make up my dreams and goals.

Never give up everything depends on your decisions, if you are negative or not believe in yourself you never to be able for your goals or other things like work, school and support other people it's important be positive, no matter what the other people say, no matter how many times you try, the key is achieve and think about your future.

The life present always new things,challenge,obstacle you has to be prepared for everything and give always the best.

For finally, the best way to achieve your goals in the life is always be positive, strong, believe in yourself and never give up. No matter the new change in your life just dont be scary and put your life in God's hands."
1211,5DEDECE96044,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. cellphones has become the major problem in schools for students and for teachers. I think that cellphones should not be allowed in the classroom because students dont do the work that they suposted be doing and schools already have tecnology to use.

Cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educacional purpose because students dont do that work that they suposted be doing. Sometimes students take pictures of homework or a test and then they pass it to a friend. They always wants to check theirs social media like snapchat or instagram. this in one reason why students fail classes or fail grades. For example, in my English class there is a guy who is always using his phone, checking his social media or checking his messages that his friends has be sending to him and he is not passing his classes.

Also, cellphones shouldn't be allowed for educational purpose because schools already have tecnology for students can use. The government gives the schools computers because they wants the students graduate and dont have any distraction by using theirs cellphones.

schools have computers or ipads and thas why teacher dont need to let the students use their phone to do any work that they have to do.

However, Students can do their work in the computer where the teacher can be checking what the students is doing, if his doing his work or not.

Some students might say that they can use their cellphones in the classroom because it is more easy for them to translate words than be looking words in the dictionary. Also, some students might say that they can't live with out using their phone. Finally, they might say that using theirs phone can be more easy because they can be checking their work any time that they want.

In conclution, I think that cellphones shuldn't be allowed in the class room. students have to learn how to live with out their phone because graduate and not fail classes is more important than be texting their friends all the time. Also, for teacher that let students to use their phone for any work

I think thats not a good idea because the teacher is helping the student to get distracted by using their phone and not passing their classes."
61,04C2DA8069E7,"The school use cell phones in the classrom for education purposes it's because they want the student learn the other way can, but they had to be doing workand the same time kids start thinking other way to use cell phones in life.

Theacher they thinking the best oportunity to explaint in own life that way we can use the cell phones appropriate in the future. Because some teacher they worry about it are future and how we can go.

some theacher try to give anything to work on parper or looking for new, event, and search anything obaut the class. they making to take some examen on line and quiz on the cell phone usen app to get on the quiz.

When we talking about schools, some they are in lawful of the schoolto us cell phones in cvlassrooms. thats why some school they have own laws about cell phone.

They are meny school they had own ruls and they don't want the student use cell phones fro any reason.

They are many institution or progant to help school how they can teach and the student learn someting new and how they can put on his life.

Conclusion they are many way you can teach studen usen the cell phone but you most to explain why? the school is important to teach student how they use own cell phone.

I hear many teacher tell the people. What other thing you can do with you cell phone, but don't tell my calling i want to hear other thing like..? I know some people don't anwer the question.?

they many thing can help people and student to can see on the phone they can do to be a better person but they don't lost time doing tha't and they are most on the computer or they take class and read book all the time.

yeah it good people read all the time but they had to explor the world too on the other side like usen new tecnology."
3416,EA970C38817C,"Do you think people accomplish more if they are always doing something or do you think inactivity serve as a purpose?

Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""Many people think that they accomplish more if they are always doing something. When people are always doing something,they are always learning new things and gaining experiences. Some people think that the more they do ,the more they achieve because being idle will not lead you to success and nobody is going to come and accomplish things for you. Therefore much may be done if people are always doing something

Certainly some people think that inactivity serve as a purpose because people can be physically inactive but mentally active and they might be creating wonderful things in their minds. Still others think that being inactive does not mean that they are being idle because they already achieved their dreams and they are satisfied with what they have so that is why they see inactivity as a purpose. Others might think that not everyone have the opportunities to being always doing something and they do not have more option that being inactive.

However, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they learn new things in the process of doing something. They learn more about themselves and about others. They learn how to interact and connect with others and how to fit in different environments. People who are always doing something gain more and new experiences that will help them later in life also gaining experiences and being in different types of environments surrounded by different kind of people will help them improve their mental maturity and also help them to to have a different perspective of see world and life. In other words people who are always doing something accomplish more,and learn more how to interact with others and gain new experiences.

Furthermore,people accomplish more if they are always doing something because the more you do the more you achieve. If people do not work and make an effort for the things they want to accomplish nobody is going to do it for them because each person is the author of their own success .Some people might be waiting that the things they want fall from the sky ,or appear magically in their hands making no effort to accomplish them and idles will not lead you to success .People who are successful today is because they were always working hard and making their best effort to accomplish their goals,they know what they wanted and they were persistent and did not give up on their goals. If people want to be successful in life they have to know that failure is part of achieving success and just have to keep trying and do not give up until they achieve their goals. Therefore people's success is based on the effort they put to achieve it because the more they do the more they achieve.

In fact, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they are spending their time in things that really worth it .If people are going to spend time of their life that will never get back they better spend that time doing something that worth it and doing something that is going bring positive ,and good things to their life. Many people spend a lot of time or even their whole life doing things that never brought something positive or good to their life and that is maybe because they never found their passion in life and doing something you are not passionate about it is just a waste of time. Therefore people should spend time following their dreams and doing what they truly love because when they are doing what they are truly passionate about, they will see that every effort they did to accomplish their goal worth the time they spent and the effort they put .As a result when people spend their time always doing something they accomplish more.

In conclusion,people should determine never to be idle and never to conform with what they have. Always work hard and aspire for bigger things ,always try to be successful and do everything and anything to accomplish their dreams, and goals and do not let anyone to tell you that you can not do something because if you believe in yourself you are capable to do everything you want .People should always spend their time in things that worth it, in things that will bring good and positive things to their life .People should be always doing something and that is how they will see what wonderful things can be done by doing always something because the more people do the more they achieve and people who are always doing something are the people who accomplish the more.

3032,D91D25F55AD9,"This world would never be how it is now if it wasn't for technology. Technology has made a big change to this world. Most people think it has made a positive change, and others think it's made a negative change. Technology has helped schools and business, but also has made some people's life impossible. So maybe, some people are wrong maybe having technology isn't so great after all.

Over time people stop talking to each other. Stop focusing in school, families, friends, relationships, All because of technology. If there was no technology there would be no social media. People see thing online that will make then mad and always want put it on other people and it all makes it a big problems. The relationships with those people then gets broken and never want to talk to each other again.

Before technology was created, families use to have game night, the whole family would all be at the dinner table eating their food and talking about their days. They would go on trips and have fun and enjoy their beautiful moments with friends and family. They would have a nice healthy sleep. Now it's all different. People get home from work to go watch T.V. or be on their phone all night long. People don't have family dinner anymore. This is a big problems that has effected a lot of people.

When I was younger I remember my parents giving me a lot of attention. As I started growing up it started to go away. We wouldn't go on trips anymore. We all wouldn't be at the dinner table anymore. Everything started to change, then over time I started to realize it was because of technology. They were just so obsessed with it, they never got off it. Then I got my first phone and I understood why they didn't come out of it. You always wanted to know what was going on with the drama, news, Facebook, Snap Chat, etc. That shouldn't be how this world should be running. God created this world so we can all stick together, be nice to each other, and care about each other.

If technology wasn't created then maybe everyone would be happy with their life's. Everyday would be a happy day for everyone. Even though technology has made some good impacts, I still think it would be better without it. Life will never be the same how it was before without it. "
1030,4EB4E8611272,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life. I believe this topic is coverstal and I have both resarch and personal experience to share that will demonstrales that many people positive attitude is the key success in life.

Everyday, when we wake up we need to think about today what is plan we need to finished? do not lazy, many people need dream. One reason, If we attitude to think about what is plan need to finished ,we don't feel boring., we feel a lot power. For example: the students will know next class should be taking the test ,the students plan to study tonight ,they do study guide, more practie during the test they will get good great. Another reason, sutdents can to do voluter or study SAT,get high soccer, also need to do very well in the class taking AP class get high GPA. For example,students on the weekend can go to hosptial or go to library to do voluter, learn society experience that is helpful get into college, and spend some time to study SAT to finish homework.

Apporoximately two year ago, I have friend, she said: I want become a coffee store with book Boss, she sucess. Beacause, during she college four year, she everyday spend half day went to part- time, earn money, earn experience,learn how to make nice flower on the coffee cup, she record what book the people like to read. she know what she want .

Inconclusion,I believe that positive attitude is important the key success in the life, we need think about what knid the life I want, and we have better furture in our life."

My idea is an offensivery pesonal remark and they attitude tietine so mach what, thry collection of emocional and beavioral traits that charecteriste a person, distribution of personal and social traits a well knonk person.

3436,EBD559A9576C,"Being yourself is being true to yourself and to others for example. When you're hanging out with a group of people. Don't act like someone else but yourself because you will get caught for trying to be someone that you're not and get made fun of for being something that you're not. It's better to be yourself because you want people to like who you really are. Not someone you ain't your just lying to yourself and others.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a Author who believe ''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. I agree with that statement but not so many could say the same. There is many human on this planet who cant accomplishment being their self than being someone else than their self .

Many people struggle to be their self because of society. Society brain washes people to be someone else than being their self.

Nowadays being yourself is lame and being someone else is Amazing to some people. Their is con on being someone else like lying to people until they fine out who you really are. Than they might not like who you really are then your feelings are hurt . Therefore your friendless and hurt ,But you could always pick yourself up by being yourself. Than by over time people will start to notice how you change and they will want to have relationship with you.

It's healthy to have relationships with you being yourself than being someone else. The reason why i am saying that is because you dont want to be lying to the other person the whole time during the relationship . It will bring problems to the relationships .However its always a good idea to talk it out and come clean.

Being yourself make a huge impacts in people daily life. It could go for the good or the worse its all up to the person. Therefore its important to be yourself always no matter what or whats the cost of it . Also make sure to take pride of being yourself.        "
3288,E446D60AD551,"I think that some things that we thought not are true in the history the students they will work is not the best effort. They believe that the source of true is self esteem is achevement. I take a positions on this issue I think that will look in the future. I think that are different peoples some person not look its future only think that the life them treat only of to live but not undertoond that not is only life. I think that students have reason of thougtht that is this is an achievement not is easy we have a achievement yes we have a achievement in this life because yes not have an achievement I do know that you thought in my opinion the trues is the point number firts in this life because that is really happened the true is import always me question for me is that yes not have true all away different.

Some things of this paragraph elieve o this prompt is that understand that the students they believe that students must be self confident and that sense have this world power CONFIDENT are two world confident and confidence Confident is feeling or showing that your are sure about your own abilities opcions and confidence is trust or stong belief in someone or something. I have every confidence in ability to do the job. They have much confident and they have much order to learn more order is to tell someone to do something in a strong way which does not permit him to refuse and without saying they ordered to learn more learn is to get knowledge a skill they learning work they thounght that are the best.

They have achievenment something that is done successfully espeacially through hard work or skill. The act of finishing something successfully the feeling that you get when you have finished something sucessfully. They in learning by lowering to move someone or something down to make something less in amount or quality. I think that the life have must chance or opportunity of have one better life of enjoy every moment yes have work hard but always enjoy every minut every hour every every year with the family is important in this life not all only have that them job always think that have must time and to stop one moment and look this life will look the future.

What is an future? an future is at or to a greater distance in time more to a greater degree the board needs time to consider the matter futher. I can't remember any futher back than 1995 at or to a greater distance in space. However many people also use futher when talking about distances especially in formal coversation only futher can be used in other senses we need a futher week to finish the project but make your life no have self rich with only proffession make your future preofession a type of job that needs special training or skill especially one that needs a high level of education and yes have one occupation is always a job or profession always a employment is a work specially when it is done to earn money it's very difficult to find work at the moment.

I think that yes have a carrer like the student best effort but work I think that I can always but have a carrer the job or series of jobs that someone has in a particular are of work usually involving more resposibility as time passes I have a friend she had a very distingushed carrer in medicine she have a profession I do know because is different a prefession with carrer or trade I think that a trade is a hob always but specially one that involves working with your hands and requieres special training but now talking of the students I think that not have a job because thought that they not have a experience in a job.

I do know that must talking of this only think in the job and the student that the other people thought that they no have experience and that is esperience is to have somehing happen to you to feel something it was the firts time I had ever experenced failure and experinced is having the knowledge or skill that is necessary for something the true this student put in me an expiration because the point important this but they is the true they have a good point the sincerity the quality of being sincere or honest sincere used about a person really meaning or believing what you say not pretending sincerely in a way that shows what you really feel or think about someone or something.

The student's have praising like you say when you are expressing admiration for someone or somethig I think that they have a precaution always precaution in the job I think precaution is something that you do now in order to avoid danger or problems in the future. We took the precaution of locking our valuables in the things with safe like precautions against fire. The students I think that they thought in implore when you implore someone when the situation is very serious and you need something very much.

They had importance about the job the decision was of great importance to the future of the business they have importance of this job only person not have tolerance but learning other people what is tolerance is like to allow accept someone or something especially opinions or behavior that you do not agree with or people who are not like you and other word is intolerance the ability to suffer something especially pain difficukt conditions the student only working together but self better so that two or more things are mixed with joined.

The other people no have compassion they no are considerable with students I think that they had considerable difficullty in getting the students they have a opinion are work the important is the true they must consider the matter carefully before they make our choice to have something in my opinion I think about someone or something in a particular way. They need considered that not are riks wastoo great to remember or pay attention to something the like the students is they have repect not are angry for no have experience in the job they are intelligent for no have insecurity is this I like not have insecure not are they have security Ilike they"
1191,5C69070E1E48,"Students would benefit and not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because you can stay at home ,not distraction,not friends or groups,tools from school that you may need,students can cheat.

Students would benefit from being able to attend school from home because you can stay at home and by staying at home you can wake up late for school. There is some students that hate waking up early for school that's one of the reasons of having the opportunity to take your classes in online. Staying at home you can be eating whatever you want there is not going to be teachers telling you that you can't eat. There might be people that doesn't have the transportation to go school and get in time for school and because children doesn't like waking 6 AM in the morning. That chance to take classes at online many students would prefer having online classes.

Other reason why students would benefit by attending classes from home is because there is not distraction at your home you can be at your room alone without no one to distract you when you're taking your classes or when you're taking a very important test. By being alone at home you can concentrate more about the things that you're learning because your friends are not there with you to distract you with another things.

Like I said there is not benefit too of having classes in online because students doesn't have friends or a group of friends to share their ideas. There is children that may need a group or a friend to talk about their ideas in classes or maybe you have a problem with something and you don't have no one to help you ,and by having not classmate it might be boring being alone.

students may need tools from school for example you need to read a book and you don't have one because you just don't own books at home and that's why I think it would not benefit because in school you have a library you can go there to find a book and there is different types of books students can pick.

Other reason why it would not benefit the students is because they can cheat.

students can cheat at everything because you don't have a teacher that is taking care that the student don't cheat at a test. If the students doesn't want to do a class he can can pay someone to make it for then ad pass it for them.

Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home. In my opinion there will be some students that will take this serious and do the right thing.

1709,81946793B89A,"Have you always wondered how your parents accomplished what they have for your future, How famous people like for example singers and world wide company's became so influential to the world. Well Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Now when you think about it, is it beneficial if your always doing something or do you think inactivity also serves a purpose?

In my point of view I have to agree on what Thomas Jefferson has stated. You can't accomplish something without working for it and I will be listing examples on why I believe in a strong way that if you keep doing something you'll be able to accomplish what you want.

My number one example is my parents, Of course its unthinkable that your parents want you to have the best future that you can get but have you ever asked on how they got to this point in life. My parents are heroes for me in a lot of ways but the most important one is how they never stay idle. they work nonstop to make sure my future is bright. They even left their home country so I can have a better life here, They never stayed idle even until this point and they've gotten pretty far.

Second example would be singers, In this day in age believe it or not singers have great influence in this world. That's because a lot of singers known to man never stopped singing or dancing. They always worked hard to become the number one or wanting to be someone in general that people would look up to. Like Micheal Jackson, Even when he sadly died to this day people still praise him for what he made in the pop music world. Or Snoop Dog and his ability to rap really fast which people gave him the title of rap god. There's a lot more people that have changed the world because of music but I think they had the highest impact.

Now the last example is company's and their founders per say. Car company's, or company's in general had or have someone who started it all, One big example would be Ellon Musk and his Tesla car company. After he made Tesla the best electronic car company to date he decided to keep moving forward with his plan to go all green. His made commuter vehicle and now his focusing on diesel trucks so there can be less pollution in the air and more safety for the drives. His making a lot of impacts in the world because his not just standing around waiting for someone else do it for him. I think I've said enough and stand by my opinion that if you are doing something you will accomplish what your wanting in the future like how this other people have just like Thomas Jefferson wrote.

1620,7B1B2E8F7E89,"I think it took a positive affect on humans lives. I think it would be impossible with out technology. My reasons are that we use technology a lot,we use it for to shop online for our phones. My two other reasons are we use them for work. We use technology for school and to learn things from back then from now.

We use technology for online and for our phones. So if we needed to contact someone it would be threw our phones. If we needed something to wear we go online buy something. If we needed go some where the in our phones theres GPS will guide us. We use our phones for lots of thing like looking at the news, or to see what time is it. Our phones has a lot of knowledge so if we need something new we use our technology

We use technology for work like if we needed finish something we know how to do it. If we needed look something up for work we do it threw our technology. If your boss calls you in for something hes using technology. So if we did not have technology we could not do anything that what we are doing today.

We use technology for our school like now Im taking test on my computer. We use technology for learning things like in history we are learning stuff from the past. We use technology for tests and to print some papers out. We use projectors for class if we need to see something. We use technology for our safety like cameras.

So without technology we could not do anything like call or text or shop online or learn. Are lives have changed a lot when technology was invented. Technology is all around everywhere you go theres going to be technology."
3682,F6B1E10F02C8,"The first impression does't mean that you are like your look, or because your look angry you are a bad person.

One day in the morning my dad show me a picture of my grandfather, he was a tall and stronger men, more later my dad come to my room and he tell me ""We are going to know you grandfather"", i was scared but , when i see hem, he was adorable and so loving with me, when a know my grandfather more, i change my opinion of the first impression, he was not a rude men.

When i see for the first time a girl that i never seem, the first that i see is how the girl look if she look angry, i think is that she is disagreeable, but in the future, when i know more about that girl i know that she is not how i was thinking in the first impressions, is not good to judge people for how they act, it does't care the color of the eye, the color of the skin or what language they speak. Some people look bad, sad, happy, angry, or evil but that's not mean that they are like they look.

In conclusion the first impression it's possible to change, because the people can not act how you think they act or they can change the attitude in the future, when i know more about this person my opinion of the first impression change."
2845,CED4F9C63B9B,"The first impressions are almost impossible to change because when people meet new person, their personal information is only what is she or he looks like, so it is hard to change their first impressions, and people do not often change the first impressions.

Firstly, they find the first impressions and guess the person who is she or he because that is what human does every single time when people meet new person. For example, student meets new person who does not look healthy body and the student guess the boy cannot play any sports by seeing his body, but people says that he is the best player on the team. Even if the student watch his game and he plays really good, it is difficult to change the first impressions because he still does not look like athletic person and the student knows how unhealthy he is.

Secondly, people do not often change the first impressions because it is individual opinion so they want to keep it in their mind. For example, there is a man who is very shy and show people that he does not want to talk to anyone, so people decide that not to talk to him. Some day, he talks to his friends and find out he loves talking with people. But his first impressions are shy and not talking with anyone so people cannot talk to him because they are not able to change his first impressions.

However, some people could change the first impression as long as making a good relationship with a person who talks to. For example, there is a man who is really big and angry face. Everyone afraid of talking to him, but a student tries to talk to him and the student find out he is a nice person to talk. Sometime, people can change their first impression which makes the person feel better so the student can talk to easily.

In addition, it could be possible to change the first impression by showing difference between now and before. For example, a student who is being mean to some friends. But some day, the student realize that it is not good to being mean to friends, so he shows the difference which is being nice to friends and helping people instead of being a mean person. Although, the friends change the first impression of the person which makes both of them happier and be able to make better friendship.

In spite of these issues, it is still almost impossible to change the first impressions. So everyone should not focus on the first impressions too much."

The school plans to change to a new, healthier school lunch mean, which would eliminate some of the students' favorite cafeteria foods.

Most students eat unhealthy food almost all of the time, and some students think it's fine and it doesn't really affects their health. Some students eat unhealthy foods while playing video game, and while they are playing video game, they grab snacks that are laying on their table or the dresser such as: chips, candies, and energy drinks energy drinks, which contains chemical and are unhealthy for them. Some students don't want to get up and go eat with their family or eat healthy food, because they do not want to miss the the game that they are playing with their friends or playing online. School should change currant lunch menu to a new lunch menu,healthier school lunch mean for students to eat healthy food and be healthier.

Students when go to lunch they just grab anything that they like and they don't think if it's healthy or not for them. Some students eat unhealthy foods during lunch because they don't think about it, or they see somebody else eating something and it makes them to try it, and wanna look cool in of their friends so they eat things that are unhealthy are them.

Some students may not like the plane to change the school cafeteria lunch menu to healthier foods, because most students are now so use to eat same school lunch every day; but eventually, students will get used to new healthier school lunch menu and they will feel alot better than thye use to, be healthy, and won't eat unhealthy food at school or at school. Lots of students don't really like eating healthy food,or drink healthy drinks like water, and juice, because it may not taste as good as unhealthy food. Unhealthy food and drinks contains chemicals that are not good for anyone's health, therefor the school cafeteria should change to a new, healthier school lunch menu.

The school plans to change to a new, healthier school lunch mean, which would eliminate some of the students' favorite cafeteria foods. School should change to a new, healthier school lunch mean for students to eat healthier food and be healthy.

2533,BBFEBE9529A1,"I am agree that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Because all the people are not easy to get a good impression, and also are not easy to change the mind. In my experience most the time when a impression come up to my self, it is impossible to change the mind, because if I don't like something my impression is very bad, but it is impossible to change my impression. Most the people do the same things I do, because we are people and we almost have the same feelings.

The first impression is always something has too much that we can talking. Most the time the first impression is hard to change is like a decision; when you took a decision is impossible to change, because is something the human have never goes down always up. this mean that the person when the have a impression about your car, picture, family, or friends they never will change the impression for them, but if the change should be impossible like a decision.

Based on my experience the first impression is impossible to change, pretty much on the humans and the animals. why I says on the animals, because long time ago, I had a dog this dog was very intelligent he do every thing I tell him, but sometime he had some impression that was impossible to change. Always I give to him good food, but something a give food that him don't liked, and his impression was very bad, always was hard that him change his impression."
3388,E926BE6F104E,"Working in a group can be helpful. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time.

Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince I'd rather work alone. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn't have been blamed for.

So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. But thats a whole different story. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise."
884,443AA4F38C8B,"I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because, i think if you want to do something be yourself in the boren world then you have to change the style of living, make yourself change the way you want it to be, everyone have a different thinking and opinions about their life.

However, sometime is really hard to achief that goal, some other people can't do what they want because is take alot of time and fail, when people are doing the something the same over over again, but maybe when they are change to defferent, i feel everyone go work so early on the morning make people over time feeling really tired and bord, some people work at 3 or 4 make them tired but they can't change anything because they have no choose about their life, but people can change to a different thing so they can be more better person.

People change what they do alot but also they scare if they going to fail it, alot they don't really take a other step with something new so whatever they do, people need to change the way they think about thing around them so they can make decision about they like or don't like. Everyone got a good choose or a good decision about their life but the importand is to define the choose that they make and desigh more about they decision so they can become more better, in world have a lot of famous people that make a lot of defferences about their life, a lot of story before they are become famous person, they all normal people just like everyone else but they just be themself so they become a different person when they planed their own way to go or to do on their life.

The world not choose you but you have to choose the world."
490,2538542762C0,"One topic that is frecuently dabated is if the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that the school should take control of the students extra activities and extra time. They feel that students need more educational activities to enrich their knowledgement at school. I believe that students should decided what they want to do with their extra time after school because some students have to work to help their families, some students have to get home earlier to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work and students like to do some other activities like sports, art or homework.

First, students have to work to help their parents and sibilings, it could be difficult to work and study at the same time, you get tired and all you think is get home and sleep, students who work do not have time to study for a quiz, test or do homework. However. Study hall could help them finish their homework, students who work don't get involved in extracurricular activities bacause they don't have time to make it through. But also they work for saving money for college, this is an a good idea because you are investing for your future. That is why students who work have to give up with some other acctivities that they want to do.

Second, some students have to get home early to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work, most of them can't afford a babysitter, this students might have the time to involve in a club, probably when one of their parents have a day off. They can do homework or other assigments for school or home while they are taking care of their sibbilings like made food for them, clean the house, laundry etc. That can get difficult for them because they have different responsabilities at the same time that they have to take care of school.

Third, other students like to do different activities like sports, they like to exercide everyday after school, there are many sports that hey can practice such as bascketball, baseball, tennis, gymnastics, etc. other students like to do art, envirroment and learn another language they can sign up for any club that they are interested on. This students are deffinetly involve in extracurricular activities from school, but they decided what they want to do with this extra time and the school do not have to tell them what should they do.

As have you read this are my reasons why I believe schools should not take control of the students activities after school. When we get to know each others personal dreams and problems this world is going to change because we are going to understand how people work hard to get succes and happiness. "
173,0D23E504FBC0,"Many people believe it is possible to change your first impression. Since a lot people have bad impression like disrespect and negative thing to say, one can change if you really want to be a better person in the society.

First of all, disrespectful people can learn how to be respectful. So when you meet again your impression can change because you never imagine that they could be an amazing person. As you can see they can have a great respect and change your mind.

Next, if a persons first impressions is negative,they could had been a bad day. You never judge anyone. Some people have good and bad days. They could feel negative because the bad day. So the next time you meet them they could have a better day.

Meanwhile, first impression is negative because is always in the back of your mind so is difficult to see it differently. As you can see the first impression is always part of your natural release.

In conclusion, you never have to judge a person before you meet them. Because they always show that reality as they are and they can change the first impression that you already know about them.                                                         "
2297,AB86BAABBF68,"It's a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass.

For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking.

If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate.

and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate.

For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate.

Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in.

I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade,

So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage

We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining.

One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades.

So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do.

It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class.

The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate."
822,3F645E7A81DB,"""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else a gretest accomplishment""

I agree with Emerson's statement it's important be yourself always and think about your future, depends own decisions what do you wanna be also we can to achieve our goals. In the world we have so many opportunities, everyone can do it, all can try no matter how many times you make a mistake, no matter what the people say about you. Just believe in yourself and be happy.

even if you dont feel sure about something like one day when i was working i was not sure about what i was supposted say like i was scared cause was my firts day at work and that what the costumer gonna say.

Sometimes i dont want talk cause its little bit hard speak another languaje but when they say you will be fine or they say positive things about me, that's means that always you find people that they support you and they give to encourage and different ways. Many times it's important take off the negative mind and be positive.

at school see kids that also have the same and also i remember when i start my firts days of the school was like that but if you be yourself and try to make you goals you can do more than you think. its better to focus in your own future than in someone else's bunisses, last saturday my friend's team won the final and i was so proud about the,

its important believe and try to support other people because they can make great accomplishment also.

finally, the best way to try got greatest accomplishment is be yourself and believe in yourself.    "
665,33CC5A37AC8C,"This prompt is talking about if we are choosing our own character traits or is our character formed by influences. First you can choose your own character you just got to know about the person life in what the person did back when he was a teenager in what the person became when he start getting older. In my opinion choosing your own character would make you realize about things that happen back then when everything back then was really dangerous for example they had slaves,mudered people, treating people badly, people been racise and more that people did in we still have on this day because people dont want to listen or they just dont care about what they are doing with there life like can we atleast have peaceful without seeing peoepl dying or taking childrens from there mothers. As you can see life from back then was kinda different for example mothers would marry their own children they would have children with their own child they would force you to marry a old man that you dont even wanna marry or have kids with a old guy that you dont even love this why its good to do your own character because you be searching for information that you dont even know about in it be very interested.

First of all you have to include for information about your own character or if the character formed by influences beyond or control by anything many characters be having there own influences in you gotta find it out to see about or if they are controlling anything for examples like a kingdom,slavery. and being part of a war. As you can see when been through so many wars in some characters be soldiers or a leader of a war to teach his soldiers how to fight a war when they get into a war. For example british soldiers has fight so many wars with alot of countries they either fight for stealing food or because they own them money they do not want to pay them back or because they have a little issues going on between them in they fight to solve their issues.

As you choosing your character you can be creactive with it like you can put somemany things that you need like examples, reasons why you choose this character, get ideas for your character , give alot examples find anything you can so your character can have so many information that it is need it for your character. choosing our own character might be a little hard but we got to find a way to get all the information for it so we can start writing about them in how when find this character interested in we got to know alot of things that this character you are doing has a good information and you want to be curious about.

This quote or prompt helps to figure out about a character that you would like to talk about in what to know about it to see if it helps you later on, in to see what they did to help other people about everything that they went through in this help the students to see that been on a war it is not easy because you are trying everything you can to be alive like searching for your own character it is very interested because you want to see about them in learn alot about the in how they did everything they could to help eachother in to see how we fight for the equal rights alot more thngs that we know now.

My conclusion- how to choose your own character can be easy for you to write about in to find alot of things and important thigns that you would need for your character when you are putting your examples to a five page paragraph about how this character do alot of things in his past and to see if he still doing ,more things now in then. In by you choosing this character would make you realize alot of things in how everything happen back then when people was just trying to live and survive."
42,03C9E7A15C42,"I think that what

Auther ralph waldo wrote i dont agree becuase he said that what you already masterd you will never grow i think that with the more you mastered the more you will know in life those things that you had masted are things that you want to do and get in life. you will understand more things like the more important thing like when you mastered drving one of the most important thing to master in life that is the first gole u want to master in life and when u do youy feel like you can do more thing once you have you get your drivers licens.

Or even as a kid when you mastered a video game you want to keep going keep getting challeged on each part of the game and when you finished on you buy another one and it keeps going even when you die on the video game you still try to keep going on unless you get fusterated and mad and you just give up and quit. Unless you keep trying you master the video game.

The things that i had mastered was the most importent one was driving its was hared for me just to get my permit and i guess it grow on me beacuase i want to do more in life i want to be able to help my family and do what i can for my sisters and brother and my mom. Like out of all the thing i had mastered i say that is one of the thing i want to do becuase be able to go to callege be some thing in life. so i say the more you master the more you grow and know as a person.

the reason why i think that the more you master the more you grow its becuase out of all the things that i had gone throw i realised that as im getteing older more and more chaleges that i will have to master will come my way in the future thing that i will want to master. i say this is why they make kids go to school so they can learn more things so that we can be challged and master things as we go throw school so we can see the type of person that we want to be in life so that we can face challeges thats whay i say the more things we master the more we grow so that we can learn from those thing."

158,0BF56A2681D3,"Dear, Principal I think students should do community service because we have to keep our schools clean. We should also have community service because it will help people be cleaner by picking up after them. The community service is very important because if know one picks up the trash that's in school then our school is going to look ugly. I think you should get people to pick up every day and then for the next day get another ten people and be rotating every day. Its also necessary to help out the community because we don't want to have a dirty environment for our children and younger kids. That's why I think we should have community service most people think its not important but years later it will be important because our children are going to be the ones living with a bad environment . I think we should have community service for these reasons because if we don't clean up right now no one will clean up in the future and that will hurt us because we are going to be living in a bad environment because no one wanted to clean up . In the future we are not going to be able to smell oxygen because of the bad environment. These are all the reasons I had to say about why we should have community service. Thank you for listening to my opinions. Sincerely, Your Student"
2194,A3A0AB366927,"Working idenpendently is harder than working as a group, but it's also better to learn things. Etheir working as a group or not you are still getting work done, and learning as you go. When I state that you can ""learn"" it means that you can find out things especially as a group where everyone has they're own ideas and facts about topics. Some people just take working as a group as an advantage to just copy and get answers just to get things done. Copying others does not help you learn anything other then getting your work completed.

I think it is better working alone beacuse it would be better for me to learn. Yes, i'd probably take a long time getting it done just because I would be taking my time finding little details. Some people choose not to work independently but I do. One reason why I think it is better to work alone is because of the fact that after your done you'll feel relieved and happy. If you did what you had to do alone without anybodys help besides the person who gave you the assignment, or job whatever than you done a good job just by doing your work independently.

Working as a group isn't bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits.

Anyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused.

Somebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. Also it's hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. You could do things your own way while working independently. All of the things I wrote about help show that it is better to work independently than with others in a group.                        "
2406,B2DAE4CC6597,"Today schools offer many tools or ways to complete your diary learning process. one of these tool is called ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"". Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work."
250,125E7C6E0D31,"Ha ha ha that the sound of happy children playing video games. Video games are what everyone is playing even in their 30's you will still see them playing. Are video games really that fun for people in their 30's.

Why do they find This Activity Enjoyable.

First, Why do kids find playing video games exciting. Do they believe it's exciting and invigorating to play video games. Video games are exciting to kids because of the action danger and excitement they get each time they play a video game. Are video games a stress reliever for stressed kids and adults. Some video games can be frustrating, but some are relaxing and soothing for the mind like Tetris and Pokemon.

Second, There are many video games in the world that people like to play like Fortnite, League Of Legends, Roblox and more. Kids play games cause of how fun it is. Kids like to play video games like a pack of wolves looking for food. Kids use their senses when playing it's like their getting a mind workout while playing a video games and they just don't know it. adult and kids use 3 senses when playing video games hearing( listening) touch( ability to play) sight (looking around). They use their other senses when eating and smell the food.

Third, Video Games has a downside to adults and kids. They ruin your eye sight if you stare at them for a long period of time. They can make your attention span really slow. Makes you shy of the outside world and of other people. There are risks when having fun.

Lastly, Kids enjoy playing video games cause it video games they don't care about the consequences that come with playing them. Adults Understand the reason and they know it will come back for them in the future but they don't care. There are all types of reasons video games are fun and bad but to kids and adults it just a way to have fun. Why do you think kids and adults play video games."
2234,A72F4E50ED92,"Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone. For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different.   "
3430,EB5924FBD25C,"Although some say schools shouldn't extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school, actually schools should extend the school day two hours because students get enough time to do their assignments and home works also teachers got enough time to check students work properly and students can add one more subject.

Some people say that schools shouldn't extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school. But if we see that in another way instead of working after school sixteen hours with in four days we can just work eight hours in our three days weekend. also it is wast energy for instance, there is one student who works after school for three days until 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm. He came at school by 3:30 pm and he works at seven eleven which is the hardest place to work. It takes 15 minute to go and he have to at 4:45 pm to reach his destination on time. And then let's see after work he gets home at 11:00pm then he sleeps at 12:00 am. How can he focus on he's classes? this person is losing 2 things;

1, losing energy

2, not focusing on his classes he might fail the classes that he is taking

The student that wants to extend the school day will have enough time to do their assignments and home works, also teachers get more time to check the students work properly because they probably got 3 days off if is there any meeting or doing some things in school for example, if the government decide there is a meeting every Friday. However, it is better for teachers to do their work as an example they can check students work on one day of their breaks and they can relax, hangout, playing with kids etc. Students also can do what every they want if we see one example, one student can finish his assignments and other school stuffs in one whole day and the rest of the the weekend is his he gets enough time if he get enough time then he is free from school for two days if he continue work on it he got 2 days free every weeks. In addition those who needs long time to study this schedule can help the students that who wants more time work on it.

Learning is gaining knowledge, so that in these schedule students can add one more subject. How ever, based on this idea two argument comes from the students who wants to add extra class and the students who wants to extend the normal class by adding one hour for each classes.

Adding one hour for each classes is better to have the experience to sit for two hours and 30 minute in one class. And also it's good to work long time on one subject, but as we see in high school student this idea is trash. It can work for only in college class based on that the college students said that ""one man trash is another man's treasure"". When I come with my idea students can add one more subject because it is Better to get credit on that class and students can choose 3 or more elective classes . For example one student wants to take 3 classes that he have to take and pass for graduate high school he wants to learn 2 classes that helps him in the future. In Virginia law you have to take English 12 and Maths classes. Also to graduate high school it require Personal and Financial Economics to take it. those 3 classes are History, Biology, and one elective class to get a full credit. If the school can only learn 7 subjects this student is going to add another 1 year to learn only one class.

Finally Schools should extend the school day two hours because students get more time to do things that they have to do and it also useful for teachers they can get enough days off. Also teachers work harder than students, so that teachers work 4 days and 3 days off. And Students can add one class to get more credit.                                                                                 "
1972,9528CA8FFC22,"Farmer British prime minister Winston Churchill once said that ''Success consists of going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with Churchill's Statement because some time in life u fail but never gave up in life. keep fighting and you will get to the place you want to get. Work hard if u fail and fail never say i'm done trying the same thing over and over. Because one day u will not know what will happen if u keep trying.

Firstly,Some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss some time people feel safe without loss in their life. For explane you trying to became a prime minster in the future and people telling you. Can't became a prime minister but all you get to do is work heard in life true in yourself you can do anything you put you mind to in life.

Secondly. some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Some people think that failure to failure is good because some time people like to try one think over and over on tell they do good at it so that what some people think in life to gave when the chances to do the same thing over and over even if they could't do it they just when to keep trying.

Sometime people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss. Because they dont like to keep trying one thing over and over so they feel safe without loss in their life. But other think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Because people like to try the same thing over and over on tell they do good at it.

Conclusion, sometime is good that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In everything you do in life. But sometime is good that ''success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm.'' in life...          "
342,19864CA2672E,"People said that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

Men and women has different impressions or simler that is the big challenge specially for a new couples.

First, Innocent child impression change when become a teen. My younger sister was hard to control her impressions like screaming front of people or portending that she's not lessening to you. However, now she's yang teenager growing and learning about her new impressions and how to change in the future.

Second, Men and women has different impressions or simler that is the big challenge specially for a new couples.

1959,93E62B4919A6,"People who value self-reliance are people that can make their own decisions. They know what to do when it comes to the important matters in life. They aren't dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they don't listen to other people and don't make their decisions based on what other people say.

Self-Reliant people know how to get through their important or ""life changing"" decisions. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. They think through about what decision they are going to make. People that don't make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. You can learn a lot from making important decisions by yourself and it can help you in the long run.

Self-Reliant people aren't dependent on other people and always follow their instincts. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions you've made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life.

Making your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision you've made affects your life every day. Most people always seem to ask somebody for help on a very important decision,

while others just think about what they should do themselves. People should just follow their instincts, their gut feeling of what they want to do; they shouldn't listen to other peoples opinions. The people should always try to make their own decisions instead of always relying on the guidance of experts and authorities."
1837,8A7299DA28E5,"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Do we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control? I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think we choose our character traits.

For example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. You have to balance it all out. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. So, I think we can control our character traits. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet.

Also, another example is being social. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. and even discover new things. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social.

Therefore, my next example is being a over yourself. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. Some people dont like those kind of people because they say ""there no fun"" or they are ""party poopers."" I'll confess that I was a little cocky and over confident when it came to sports because i was a very competitive kid. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. I could've not yelled I could've just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself.

Finally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits."
441,21535555126A,"I agree that you shouldn't aim high, because when you aim high you never have a staring point to your own process, if you aim high it could ruin your work ethic and how you see yourself, and lastly you can make muiltiple mistakes and correct it and make it perfect work, compared to aiming and doing horrible work and falling back down to the bottom.

When you aim low you have way more time to gain information, practice on your work, and have a good idea on what you want to do. For example the creator of Microsoft Bill Gates he didn't just wake up one morning and said"" im going to create a software system named windows"" he woke up and began to study computers, and everything about how a software works. So aiming low gives you the advantage of failing and not giving up on what you want to become. Most people are always told to ""aim high"" the ones that are told to aim high will never be able to handle failure because they never aimed low first and then worked their way to the top, that is how setting your aim to high can make you fall short in life.

Aiming high, and having a high expectation can really hurt your work ethic, Why you ask? because once you aim high and never practice on your work thats how you fail, the way you work will not be the same compared to a person who aimed low and is making his or her way to the top. For example Delonte West was a NBA basketball player he was really good, until he began to use drugs once he did that he was kicked out of the NBA and is now currently poor. You see the reason why the NBA kicked him out of the league was because they have very high expectations for him and wouldn't expect him to do drugs at all but, if he was using drugs before he even entered the league and stopped using them completely and went to the NBA he would still be playing to this day that is a good example of aiming high and falling short and aiming low and achieving your mark.

The only way to start in any journey or process that you do is to start from the bottom meaning aim low and you'll achieve your mark. Aiming high can not benefit how you were able to make it to where you are now. That is true Michaelangelo was right about aiming high and falling short. So you must start low first figure out your plan, then begin to improvise and get ideas on what you want to do, and begin your process, that is exactly how you achieve your mark

In conclusion, i highly agree on what Michaelangelo said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"" that statement was true, Aiming and srting low first is how ideas come in and you are able to see what you are working and you show people what you can do until you reach your highest peak, instead of aiming high and failing and not knowing what to do now cause you failed. So start low first and go on from there."
1302,63E2278271E4,"The British john Lubbock wrote 'your character will be what you yourself choose to make it'

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

2189,A38187259EEE,"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences.

Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn.

For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people don't think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school. "
535,28FF89DC3B40,"Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involved with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagree to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family.

My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved.

There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates.

My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. But in the other hand there are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club.

This is why i disagree that student should have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.              "
916,4665A1D77D6C,"In this passage i will tell you my point of view of this, I believe that it dosen't matter how much experience someone has over the other person, it only increases there chances of getting picked, and only by a small margin. my reason is that people shouldn't pick a person by what or how much experience they have, but pick the people that are best for the job such as being a hard worker, fast learner, or by being determined to work. you might not have the experience but they can still pick you for the job, all you have to do is to prove to them that you can do learn it and will be able to do after it.

I think getting a new job is like learning a new unit in a class all you need is a person to show you how they do it and improve on that and, you will have setbacks or things that you won't understand. but you will still have the teacher or the person that is helping you, that can tell you if your doing something wrong or to answer your questions. once you had enough practice with it, you can help other people that have the same problems as you or the same questions. by getting the job you've learned how to do those things and how to teach other people how to do it too. you don't need experience you need people with experience to teach you so you can teach other people.

In my experience to have a good worker they don't need to have experience, they only need people to teach them while there working seeing what they are doing wrong and improving on that. while i was working in a construction job, i was making mistakes all over the place, i wasn't doing well with tools or machines, sometimes i would cut the materials too small or too large, so most of the time i would hand it over to one of my coworkers and with the tools, most of the time would get them mixed up, for example one coworker will ask for a tool and my mind would just be blank then they would just get it themselves, so after i had to practice with the tools and by the end of the time i was working there i never got one thing wrong, this proves that all you need is practice during the job or work, it dosen't matter if you have never done it before all you need to practice.

Although i do acknowledge the people with experience have more of a chance to get the job there going for but all i'm saying is that you shouldn't doubt yourself when someone has experience and you don't, just keep your eyes open and your head strong and see if you got the job, and if you didn't, try another time, it dosen't matter if you fail to get the job once or multiple times, it dosen't matter if someone has more experience then you, if you prove to them that you can work harder then them, and learn more then them they will pick you for the job. all you need to do is go to the interview and show what you can do and what sort of person you are.

In this passage i have show that you don't need to have the experience to get the job or being a good worker, you just need to be determined to do the work and they will recognize that, and they will respect you more. but only if you do good work you can't expect good things to happen because of bad results, but if you prove to them that you will be able to learn how to do it then you will get the job. i have also shown my own experience with it of being a worker that had no experience to being the one that never messed up at the end.

43,03CB73341E0E,"Do you think its a good idea to have somone make your decisions for you all the time? There is somthing you should know about having a person make decisions for you, and making decisions for yourself. I think making your own decision is the best way to solve life important problems, and I will tell you why I think so.

Making your own decisions is a sign of taking your life to the next level in many ways. Ways such as maturity, self confidence, determination, and intelligence. The reason why taking others advice all the time isnt good is because there is going to be a time where no one will be there for you when you make that life changing decision or in a situation where you have to make the decision right away. When you learn to follow your own instincts and learn to make your own decisions is the moment you can show others that you are a responsible for your actions, That you are a fully matured adult. At the end of the days its all about whats best for you and the people around, the people who depend on you.

Having somone make your decisions for you is a sign that you are not ready for the real world. Like I said before, you will get to that specific point in your life when you are just going to have to make this important decision. Thats why its always important to learn to follow on what you think is right. Your dependents when you were a kid, always taught and told you what the best thing to do is. So when you get old enough to make decisions on your own, you know whats best for you. The times you should be taking advice from others is when you're a learning child. A child learning off examples from your parents or dependebles. The times when you should be making decisions for yourself is the times when you have learnt off these examples as a child from your dependents, now to grow up as an adult and do whats best for you. And the cycle continues. I think its more understandable when you put it that way.

In conclusion, self decision making shows you are a responsible adult in many ways. And most importanly shows you are ready for obsticles that will come in your way in the real life. depending on others just shows you still need people to make these decisions for you even though there will certainly be a time when there will be no one but you. And this will really hurt you if you dont start to take responsibility for yourself and your dependents. So yes, I think people should make there own decisions."
3697,F75D6E5CCE78,"Imagine how life would feel like when you can't have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. About a week or two ago i went to Panda Express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that I got there, I asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i can't have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. I think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food.

secondly,If students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. Mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave.0nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we don't want our accidents and school detentions to increase.

In addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. This is some of the way you can make more money so, Mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. Mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school.

Therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they can't have what they want. This will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. In case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to eat what their mom or dad have prepared waiting for them,so if the principal wants them to focus in class then he is supposed to give them what they like.

In conclusion i think leaving the old menu would be a good idea because if the principal wants the students to try to improve in their class then he should leave it. Therefore if the students wants to add th healthy menu on it then he should let them vote on it whether they agree on what he is saying but i would say leaving the old one should be the best for the students.

1507,73D69658CF95,"Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. For those who can pay a fee for it would be perfect because they have the material to do that, like enternet, computer, or any other device to joing by online or video conferencing classes. Some students woul benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but just those who really need it, like students with disability or health problems. It would not benefit students whom have a hundred percent of their ability to develop anything, it would make them more lazy than what they normally are.

Generic_Name is a student who has a hundred percent of his ability but he does not like go to school. He is always skiping classes and never make homework. Generic_Name is a student with health problems who can not assist to school like a normal teenager because he has to be connect to a oxygen tank twenty four, seven. Generic_Name does not want to go to school and Generic_Name can not do that. The school which both of them used to attend is offering a distance learning program for students and the first two students who joing are Generic_Name and Generic_Name. If schools decide to create this program for students, them most priorize at the moment to acept students.

Distance learning program as an option for students to attend classes from home. It would benefit thousands of students whom really want to learn and be successful in their life. If schools which have this program available for students allow students like Generic_Name and Generic_Name to be part of it. The one who is going to be benefit more would be Generic_Name because he is the one who really need this program, he is the one who want to learn new stuff, he is the one who want be someone in the future. Generic_Name would be just one more of those students who are trying to take the easy way for everything, acting like if the world goes around him. But there is also an amount of students who can not have access to enternet or any electronic device to access to the online classes. So it turns a problem for those who does not have acces to any of those things and has health problems like Generic_Name or who does not have enough money to have what they need to participate. The online classes would be hard to them no matter what. If schools created a plan for those students it would be more easy to them to develop themself.

In conclusion some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, for students who does not have a hundred percent of their ability, student with health problems, students who really need it. Them also may create a program that help students without enough economy to take those classes. If schools are creating new ways or programs for those whom really need it, them most think about all the needs that them have and try to supply it, not with a hundred percent but helping with what they can. So students can learn and be successful n the future. Remembering that the one that are students right now, are the future of the world. "
2016,985FC4A0FAE2,"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools ."
2630,C2E3AD707EDC,"I have the idea that our school should adoptep this model that consist in extending the school day two hours. This model come from a system of some businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources, this model can help student get more involvev in their apprenticesship and school's activities.

This idea can help stueden but it have disadvantages is well, because there will be some students that will take a lot of time to be in the habit because they were accustomed to the normal school day. Also some students have to work after school, this meas if they stay at the school more time, it will less time that they will have to make work's hours, but this dosen't affect them to much, because they will attend to the school only four day in a week. This is graet because they will have a long weeked to make their tasks and work and help their parents at home with the home's jod. One reasons why our school should follow this model is the creations of new classes like: workshop , drama, and stodios of art . Student can be involvev in every kind of activity to spend their time in something that will help them in their future. Everyone can join up to any program at the school like ORTC this is a great program for some student that are thinking about join up to some militar's branchs, as we know the military can give you many benefits really good, with this program they will get a rich knowledge about it.

Many peoples will disagree with this new model of extending the school day two hours because some of them dosen't like the school already. Also some parents can be disagree because they think that the students doesn't need that much time at the school that's why the school should make a specific schedule, addding more breaks and activities and then, they will realize that this model of extending the school day two hour will be good, and then student will take advantage of time that they will have to learn more.

In example we have a groups of society as we know like some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources. That way the worker have a extra day that can be spend with another work and they are available to have a second jod. This can help them get a better financial life or take that extra time to esped it with their families. In conclusion there are many reason and caress why our school should adopted this model of expending the school day two hours more .

I agree with the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for this reasons: Failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life, failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, and failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success.

The first reason failure in want pursuit your success do you make wrestler in the life I thing that because every day fight for want pursuit you success but many times failure in things but continued fight every day. Also I thing that because if you effort every day you fight for pursuit your success and that do you make a wrestler in the life.

The second reason is failure in want pursuit your success this one can do you make better in the life, I thing that because when you commit one failure this teach you to don't make that failure again. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to want overcome more every day and make better.

The third reason is failure in want pursuit your success do you make more strong in pursuit your success I thing that because the failure give you knowledge in the life and help to make the correct in the life. Also I thing that because when you failure that help you to overcome.

267,13578C0BCC3C,"I disagree that the school board should add one hour and a half hour to school each day, because we need time to do Homework and study and spend time with family but if the school boards adds a hour and a half hour then we cannot do those things. we also need to have fun like going outside. When we get home we can only a little time to study and do homework and maybe have some fun. We will be bored in school and be tired cause then we get home we will be tired of all the time in school so we would want to take a nap but then we won't do Homework we wont study or do anything cause we will be tired. Sometimes i have to be home early and take care of my little brothers but if the school board adds one hour and a half hour then my brothers will be all alone.

I disagree that the school board should add one hour and a half hour to school each day because some teachers might have to take care of they're children and they need to take care of him at 3:30 but if the time of the school changes then he will be late to take care of they're children and come 4:30. they would want to quit they're jobs. Get another job then the school will lose a lot of teachers. All the students will be hungry because they got lunch early. Some students will not even go to school they will skip or just not go to school if they're is one hour and a half hour. If students parents want they're sons to be home early but the students cant because they're going to be one hour and a half hour extra so then a lot of students wont be in school then they're parents have to pick them up.

I disagree that the school board should add one hour and a half hour to school each day. Because the students are gonna have to get a second lunch. The lunch ladies are going to say they are tired and cant cook anymore. The lunch ladies will quit. We will have no lunch ladies. We will not eat anything.

I disagree that the school boards should add one hour and a half hour to school each day. Some parents are not going to let they're children go to school if the school board adds on hour and a half hour to school each day. Parents will be mad and sue the school. Also some of the parents will travel with theyre children to another state to another school with no extra time. The school will lose a lot of students.

I disagree that the school boards should add one hour and a half hour to school each day. Some parents want to take they're kids out and have fun but not if we have extra time. A lot of students will be mad cause they will not have fun but have to learn more at school. Parents would be mad because they wanted to take they're sons out but can't because they're will be extra time. So students cant have fun and do more work at school."
233,10F5D7C3719C,"Some people shose for a four work week model, should be this one be taken as practice at schools. In this option there are many people who think this is a benefit to conserve energy in whatever place.

I think that this practice could be disadvantage because it will be two more hours of work, between longer day , the estudents will be using more energy in those ten hours every day.

Then, we have to use more resources at school for the students be working in class those resources could be naturals, we could be wasting many papers,water when we are in the school and we have to make progress of this kind of resources.

Also, ten hours each day we will be wasting resources as electricity every class could be using computers,monitors,tablets, and we have to find a way how to save this resources at school.

In conclusion all of this are my reasons and explanation by this model of how to conserve energy and resources at schools. "
2872,D03CE04CF47C,"""People believe in praising a student work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student best effort"". First, you have to make respect your self, because if you don't do that change, people never is going to respect you and that is something you have to achieve. Second, making the best effort is very good in the today society probability not every one cares about how much you work some people just doesn't see that way. Third, another way that you can make your self respect is acting with a good behavior that's what people see on a person.

To be self-confident. In order to learn students needs to put more attention in class and on what they're doing. First, learning doesn't have anything to do with self-confident, because learn and self-confident are two different things. Second, if you trying to make your self respect you have to start respecting others first, and if you respect then they are going to respect you. Third, I believe that true self-esteem come from achievement, because you earned not is just there for you that is something you have to earn.

In conclusion, self-esteem is not something easy to have you have to work harder to earned that privilege, I don't think school's have something to do with self-esteem or self-confident, but that's something you have to work to get it. "
2982,D5E4F0C7D0BC,"Are educational activities enjoyable? There are many different kind of people that like different things. But, if you are a person that likes science this is for you. one educational activity is a experiment because there are a lot of people that like to record data and find out how something works.

Many people like to like to record data, so they might really enjoy a experiment. For example, in a experiment that a person has to measured and put the data in a table. Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it but there is always going to be a person that wants yo do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think a experiment is more affected.

This is one reason why I think experiments are a enjoyable activity.

In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does a experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It maybe new or not.

This why I think a experiment is a enjoyable activity.

Recording data and finding our how something works are just two reason why experiment is a enjoyable activity. People will fight just to record data. Other people will spend all their life doing experiment just to fine something out. This are the reasons I think a experiment is a educational and enjoyable activity. "
287,153C3543E432,"People who value self-reliance defined as the need of each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas.

Should people make their own decisions about life important matters,or should they ask someone else for their opinion.

People should ask for guidance from experts about life important matters.

There are times when depression comes and stress appears because,of bad decisions made by one-self.

If people do not ask for experts guidance, there is a possibility that in the future the decision they have made, might affect them in the future and cause a fatality like, depression which can lead to deadly thoughts and mental problems like bipolarity.

Depression is one of the most know in all over the world which is caused by,bad decisions,over working by mental and physical jobs, family problems, and an unhealthy life style which all of this can lead to suicide thoughts.

For example, one of the most famous singers from United States Sia known for her most popular song ""chandelier"", she committed many bad decisions which had lead her to drug addiction.

Her fame was getting higher; and many contracts for more shows where she had it to attend to, were exploding her head which lead it to an over working stage.

She has an amazing soprano voice, with more than five different tones, and because of that, different music productions wanted to sign a contract with Sia, but she instead of taking a rest she decided to continue, knowing in which stage her body was passing through, she decided to take drugs to cover her stress but, instead of taking away her stress she became a drug addict which lead her to suicide, but thanks to the doctors she is alive; now she keeps being one of the most popular singers but, because of her pass, she covers her face with long hair bangs to the top of her upper lip; and no own has seen her face since that incident.

Also, bad decisions might lead to mental problems like bipolarity, and sadly most of the cases are seen in schools where parents and teachers do not notice until is late for that youth to recover, because of his or her bad decisions that this students had made.

For example, a student from a school in Virginia known for his great intellectual was passing through a rough time, he had to go to work every single day after school from Monday to Monday his hours to school were from 7:30 Am to 2:15 Pm, and his work hours were from 2:30 PM to 10:30 PM every single day.

He never gave up he always was the top student of his class, but there were times where his parents were putting more pressure, and Test were near to come and work was getting more and more exhausted until one day he exploded.

The day of hes graduation arrive and his most treasure sister wasn't able to accompany him because she was getting into the same stage that he already pass through.

After his graduation he wanted to have a life and do what he always wanted to do since he was a child which was being in the Marine, he was already in a bad state because of all the pressure he gent through but, he wanted to fallow his dream.

One Saturday in the morning he decided to apply for the Marine but, sadly he was not accepted because of his migratory circumstances and because of that, hes brain collapsed in a stage of dementia, but his mother instead of giving an affection, she got mad and told him ""Stop, you are a man already, act like one"", the only one who tried to calm him down was his little sister who did not know what to do but to say ""He needs some experts help, he needs to go to see a doctor in that way, we can make a good decision and know what to do"".

After all of this happened he went to a mental hospital where he was hospitalized for three long months and now he is living a life with medications from an expert who helped him to go through all of this where he was diagnosed with bipolarity.

In conclusion, if someone wants to make a decision which is about their life importance is better to ask an expert and prevent all this things to happen in that way there can be a reduction in mental problems and suicide attempts."
733,3898358B58BB,"To conserve energy and resources, Some businesses have adopted a four day work week, With each day consisting of ten hours. My school should not follow this model or even consider extending the school day by two hours. At my school a full day of school consists of seven hours. Seven hours is more then enough, Now having it to be nine hours would be very overwhelming for everybody. Extending it two more hours is too much stress on the students , as well as the teachers. Also most students have a part time job after school and won't fit everyone's schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help. It also would not only affect the students but the teachers too. Some teachers have a second job to go to after school, Some teachers have children to go take care of at home. Also it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they usually are in school, The students mind shut down. once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isn't picking up the information and isnt learning anything. The student isnt focousing and also tired. So it would not benefit the students much , by adding the two hours. It will most likely have the students failing, because they're not leaning or doing their work. No good benefit will come out of extending the school day, Only bad. The school board should leave it how it is. My school should not follow this model by extending the school day by two hours."
3310,E55289EA6492,"The author who wrote this line was very smart based in the life actuality the people when say, "" you will never grow"" I'm agree with the author I think in this world some people not are conform with the that have. However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time.

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money.

So they's think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility.

The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles.

The conclusion is that the life have many opportunities bad you have the option take one opportunity. For that you can grow and can be a good person, and be intelligent because the vanity is bad adviser."
1790,876CDA4D152D,"Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldn't commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they don't want to do anything.

A lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasn't something that she wanted because she didn't like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind.

Since I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. I can't commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I can't commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it.

There are many students at my age that really don't want to do anything with their life or they don't have the ability do it. Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably it's something they are not good at and give up. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive.

Some say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. At a young age not all students can do a career. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldn't only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it.

2518,BB18A75AC035,"Work requires a lot of concentration. At Generic_School, I prefer to work alone because I do what I think, no body interrupt me and I concentrate better when I am by myself. I will give three reason and examples about why I think working alone is better than working with a group.

To follow at what my brain tells to me is the best decision I can ever do. I remember one time when I was in middle school, I was working with a group of five students. That day the teacher told us to make a surprise to the children with cancer. I had an idea to make a letter and a big poster with some illustrations to make those children happy, but we didn't because my partners didn't want to make the poster and we only did the letter. that's why I always believe that is better to work alone.

In my English class, the other day teacher made some groups, and each group had to make an essay about the contamination of earth. I was in a group of four, I was trying to do my best by reading a book about earth and what causes earth get pollution, when one of my partners stopped me by removing the book that I had, that made me really angry, and now that makes me over thinking that working alone is one of the best choice that one person can make.

I remember the last year here at Generic_School, Generic_Name my health teacher told the class to make some groups for presentations about drugs and its diseases that these can cause. And also, each group have to pick their topic about what are you going to present she said. I asked her if I could make the presentation by myself and she told me that I can, but it may be difficult for you because it is hard to explain in front all your partners she said. I did my presentation about the alcohol, and she congratulated me because the hard work that I did.

She told me that she was glad about me because I did the best presentation from the class. That's why I always prefer to work alone, so no body can interrupts what I think.

In conclusion, these years really changed my point of view because now I think that working alone is one of the best choices that a human can make because it makes a person over think and believe more in their self. Now I am ready to continue with this adventure. "
2480,B8624C2D465A,"For various reason's i think that student's should have at least a B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities. the first reason is because a lot of student's maybe think that a C average it good. But , for many other student's a B is a better average then, a C.

Also, i think that it would be a better reason for the student's because a lot of student's want to participate in sports or other activities. So, then they could focus more in school and, get good average's.

The second reason is that parent's would also be happy for there children to have good grade's and, that they could participate in school activities. and, also they will be proud of there self's. So"
1679,7FB017FAC682,"Well I think we should always be doing something because it take your mind off of other things in your head. We can accomplish more if we are doing something like people have accomplished a lot within the years and look where we are now. We could be farther but some people are always lazy and don't like doing nothing. Those people gotta get out of there house and do something for that world each person can change the world a little but at least they are doing something.

The most greatest people that lived or lives on this world have done amazing stuff and it's not because they are sitting down in their couch eating and watching tv,it's because they are out their learning more and doing more for us the people so we can have a better future and I want to do the same thing so I can give my children a better future and a better life. Think of it this way if they are building a skyscraper do they only put a group of five people to do the work NO right they are gonna but hundreds of people because ""much may be done if we are all doing"".

What Thomas Jefferson said is true we can do more if we all but our part but there are people that don't want to do nothing but that is ok because there is people out there that is putting more effort then some of us. Imagine if the whole world doesnt do nothing for a whole day where would our economy go to or our community they would collapse. If we all do our work imagine how our economy would go and how our community would improve if we would all do something our world would be a better place for all people and animals. For right now more people our doing their part than people that are not because if more people are not doing nothing than people that are doing something then this world would have collapsed already.

If your are a person that is always putting in their part you will recieve more than the people that dont do nothing. Look life is a test full of choices the choices are what define you and what you have done and they will define you your whole life and your choices may be better for the people or not but if their not the chose wisely next time because choices can change the world like chosing to do something or not. Its not bad to not doing nothing your not doing damage to no one all i'm tryna say is that your help could help the community and the world so don't be afraid to do something and dont be ashamed of doing something and failing be ashamed of not trying."
828,3FE7AF072783,"Soccer has always been the most important priority in my life. It is not just a game but a whole different world for of its own. In the other hand, education has been also an essential part of my life. Living in a world full of competitions and challenges needs so much of a person's will power and hard work then just having an outstanding goal and not working on it. Business is something devastatingly related to education and hard work but sports are also a type of business that most of the people do not observe it.

Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player of all time, is the person I mostly want to meet. I have always been fascinated by your skills and finishing in the field. Every teenager changes their goals for their future at least 5 times, but I have had this dream of being the greatest soccer player in the world since my first year in middle school. I can assure Messi that if he takes me to the Barcelona's beautiful stadium, I will do my best to show him how serious I am to be the greatest soccer player. I believe Messi can select me to show the true feeling of being the greatest soccer player and to let me see the most beautiful stadium of their team because soccer has always been the top priority in my life, it is not just a game but a whole different, beautiful, and unbelievable world for me, and soccer is the only game that I can play all my life without any regrets.

It was the first year in middle school that I actually understood what soccer is. Since then I have been in love with soccer. I lived in Generic_City and my parents are Asian; that is why I have had quiet some obstacles during my life because any Asian parent wants their child to study, study, and study. I was always against those who thought that sports cannot be a true career and business. I never gave up; although my parents told me hundreds of times to work on your education and study hard, but I kept it all balanced and I didn't let my parents know that soccer was always the top priority in my life. Soccer teams and opportunities in our school is important, like working hard and getting into JV was really important for me, and I will surely work hard and do my best next year to get into varsity too.

Some people believe that soccer is just a simple game which anyone can play when they have free time and have nothing to do. I totally disagree with that concept. I believe soccer has its own world. It can be a professional career and it can be a brilliant way to earn money for those who works to earn money. The first day I watched Messi's video on YouTube had me surprised that how can a person be so magnificent at controlling, dribbling, passing, and shooting. He was just perfect. There are hundreds of soccer players out there who have unbelievable and outstanding skills like: Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Neymar Jr, Mbappe and so many more.

Did it ever happen to you that you have played for hours and hours and your mom calls you to come home saying, ""it is enough"", but you feel like you had just started playing 10 minutes ago and how did the time went so fast? It is always the feeling I have when I play soccer. I never get tired mentally while I do get tired physically after 3 hours of playing. I want to play more and more and that feeling never gets old. That feeling shows how much you love the action you are doing. Money is one of the most crucial thing to survive in this world but if I had to choose between never ending amount of money in my bank account and freedom to play as much soccer as possible, I would gladly choose soccer.

Most of the time my imaginations are so nice that I just do not want to move and ruin it because all I imagine is me playing in professional soccer game and millions of people being my fan and I have all the skills that I wanted to have. Imaginations are nice but in real world we have to work real hard and with passion to achieve our goals. Although most of the people believe that soccer must stay as a game that anybody can play in their free time, but I completely disagree because soccer is a complete professional career for anyone who wants to play. Anybody in this world can be the greatest soccer player but the key is to work hard and challenge yourself every single day to become better. No one is perfect that is why we have to practice all the time to be better person in our lives."
279,14AC534FFE42,"graduating early is a very good idea but before start with my opioun or make any suggestions i would like to take sides first. graduating early comes with a lot of work and troubles . before you will be able to graduate early, you will need two math , two science ,two history and other elective subjects to graduate .but if you don't have any of that or maybe failed some classes in your freshmen year or sophomore year, it's all pales up and wait for you in your senior year. or maybe you refused to go to summer school or even take some classes during the summer, it's affect you in your senior year. summer school sometimes help you to reduce some classes during your school year.

Every high schooler's"" dream is to walk on stage with a big smile on his/her face. but if you don't do the necessary part of passing your Sol and getting good

GPA to college , you might as well want to stay and wait for your traditional four years.

Many high school er""s sometimes want to leave high school and go to college because they want to live on their own, out from home,experience new things, meet new friends, or even meet new people and learn about other things and also sometimes too student graduate early or want to graduate early because they don't. like their school or get bullied a lot in high school due to that they try their possible best to leave the school before something happen to him/her.

But from my point of view I think every high school er should wait till their traditional four years of high school because college can be very very stressful if you not well organized or you not well fit.

And also before you make a decision to go to college or even work force or maybe start a life right after high school, make sure you are financially stable because college or anywhere else after high school will be very tough and very challenging.

Preparing to graduate early and go to college a year early it's very hard sometimes because you wouldn't know what you want do in college and you will be on a waiting list and you will have to pay for every semester which is going to be a waste of money and also time . so i think every high schooler's should wait till their traditional four years and be more prepared and financially stable before they graduate .

2462,B7350254EE93,"Why people should make their own decisions for them self.

Should people make their own decisions? yes people should make their decisions because important, people will accomplish more faster, and teaching responsibly.

People make decisions important. Everyone wants to feel like they play an important role in the family. By allowing your children to help decide entertainment or snack types, you give them a place in the family where they realize their voice are heard. from something as simple as deicing which good thing to buy they can feel like they are a part of the family more so than will be present they simply want to matter.

When people make their own decision people will accomplish more faster. When you know exactly what you are trying to achieve, you can do it faster period. I doubt that requires more explanation speed comes from greater clarity of purpose and process.

People make decision teaching responsibility. Not all decisions can be met with a successful experience. Perhaps a child picks a movie that is not as good as he or she thought it would be or dessert was disappointing in last. This can help you teach you child to learn from previous experiences. He or she needs learn that not all decisions have a good and positive out come and we learn from this process to make better decisions next time.

Should people make their own decision, it is important for themselves, and important role in the family. People can teaching a child decision have good things and positive. When people make decision they will accomplish more faster you can know exactly what you are trying to achieve."
3369,E88DDF2C81EB,"I believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. What I mean by that is being nice and giving a good feedback to the things and actions people do and say. We can show how matured we are. We can be examples for others that are living with us too.

I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Name's team always losses and she use to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her team mates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing with out even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they dont wine that they will be happy to be able to play.

On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his home work. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he wold say that its fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldnt wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad.

over all positive attitude is the key to success. Whenever we dont fell like we are having negative energy we should ask and understand that it could get worse. By positive altitude we could get more that we lose if we are having negative attitude."

If you don't like to leaving in a place were there is lots of people that litter then I think you would be able to tell some friends to do some community service is a very good idea because it helps keep your town or city clean.

3616,F3F4454A2E3B,"Most companies look for specific characteristics in potential employees. Some people think that companies shouldn't look for specific characteristic in people and let the person thats applying, get the job and learn while he/she is working with the company.

Some people have a better education than others, which that would be one of the characteristics that company would be looking for, trying to hire someone. But sometimes those people aren't good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think I'm a very good candidate because, I'm good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally I'm may not have much experience on this kind of work but I'm a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job.

One reason, I think I should be hired is that I'm good working with people. One of the things I enjoy the most about working is the ability to work and share ideas with people in my past jobs, I feel like it makes the work environment a lot better because it make the work easier and more enjoyable. Because the more are working together the job gets done faster, I'm always willing to help if anybody needs me I'll be there planning things out with the person give him/her feed back on what she thinks and work out something that can work for both the company and themselves. I try get along with all my work partners so I can make it the best experience for me and for everyone else around me.

Another reason, is I'm always willing to work extra hours if needed. I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. So if you ever need me to work for extra hours don't hesitate to give me a call. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we can't give the workers that break because the company doesn't have enough people to cover that person. That's why I'm willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire.

Finally, I'm a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph I'm willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me I'll do it at the best of my ability, it doesn't matter what it is I'll do it. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, I'll do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give. I'm always willing to do something new and challenging so I can extend the things I know, All I want you to know is that what ever you tell to do I will give my one hundred percent.

As you have read this why I think I make a good candidate and a good addition to your team. I'm good working with people, I'm willing work longer hours if needed, and I'm a hard worker. I hope you consider hiring me and i hope the best for the company. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things I'm able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job. Thank you for reading and taking my application for consideration.        "
2366,AFBC394080FC,"Are you agree or disagree with the statement of Emerson about individuality?

I'm agree with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson, one example is because when you be yourself some people feel comfortable, but some doesn't but there is nothing more important than be yourself you don't know the things you can get done when you challenge you. And yes the world is going to take you down, is going to face you with things that will make you do wrong things, or change your mind like trying to be another person. But you has to face it don't give the rights to people to take you down. People when they see all the things you get done, they start to hating you. But you don't has to listen to then you dont' has to change your mind just because they are talking. Some people want to decide for you, i mean like for example; when you want to study a career but your friends, parents, etc they told you to study something you don't like, you dont has to listen to them you can make your own choice if you are a grow man you are going to do what you like, thats why you has to always be yourself,

doesn't matter the circumstance. You see me my father just left, he let me alone with my mom she work hard that i could be here, and i see that thats why i'm always try to be my self i try to work hard ever single day because the effort she did for me !bruh! is amazing. On my country the gangs shot you for no reason and i grow with my grandma and the gangs they live around us but all that i never change, i could ed be one of them but i grow with a really good education and didn't wasted.

I didn't pretend to be a person that was not me and as the author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""is accomplishment to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else""

Always be yourself don't change your mind, because life is hard nobody said life is going to be easy you has to work hard for your own things, to be someone in this life and don't listen to the world because the world don't want to see you grow or happy. Don't listen to it. Just trust on god and yourself, and you will see the the amazing things you can get done by your own. In conclusion, don't listen to anybody that is against your decision because that kind of person just want to hurt you."

For example: The British naturalist John Lubbock was sophisticated person as one his characteristics traits therefore he had the right to write and read when other didnt have the choice. When John Lubbock choose to become an politician , but also a naturalist which he chose to become one. When John Lubbock wrote this prompt he took action to write it instead of be influence by others and becoming the same as them. Because if all politician were the same and influence by each other every time they would all be the same and wouldnt have made their mark. Back then I havent known a lot of British politicians that were naturalist as John Lubbock but, until now because he made his mark. People should have to make their own choices anyways because you cant work as a politician and always agree with what people say and be influence by it you have to make your own choices. In between that John Lubbock shows he's made his own choices about this and you as the reader to think about it also and makes a choice. When it come to talking about what characteristic traits we have its based on the person who decided to become whoever they want to become and control their out come in life. In conclusion the way were based on the way we act or show who we are, for are traits "

The main person that I want to see that lives in LOCATION_NAME is my dad.He was always there for me for my brother and my sister.He took us places that we wanted to go to,like LOCATION_NAME, LOCATION_NAME,and LOCATION_NAME.He gave us everything we asked for,but when my mom and him got seperated we didn't see him much.We only saw him for the weekends,and it was okay at least we were spending time together with our cousins and him.

When I arrive at Texas the first thing I want to do is hug my dad,and then go eat with him with my brother and sister.After doing that I want to see all of my family that lives there especially my favorite cousins.There are so many things I want to do once I get there, but it wouldn't happen in one day."
1827,89A2B91E59C5,"I know that having career coarses is a great idea for students to identify their careers in High-school. By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared.

Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress.

There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier aren't intrested. If High-schools don't take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isn't right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives.

Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. College professors won't have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for test's and final exams.

Having career coarses in High-school will cost a lot of money, but why not spend it if are main focus is to educate the students and help them suceed in the future. After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society.

We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students,

We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study. "
2306,ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we can't stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes.

Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We can't just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

In conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson's quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.

So we can leave a better future for our childrens.              "

1779,86A511A55117,"I think students can benefit if they are able to attend classes from home, even know the distance but learning as a option for students who wants to finish a carear or have a good job.

Take those classes online or videos conferencing is not the same thing like to be able to go to classes. In class students can ask about any question they have or get the information they are looking for, and the schools teacher can see how they are learnig but, online they don't have much oction like read a book or be able to ask any question they have to anybody.

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future. Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time.

School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.

Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools.

Schools is a benifif for all yung people to learnd how start life, when you get out from schools and have a good job. for have the opportunite, students need finish school firts. Not matter the distance or the skills they have during that period time. after that they will see how everything is change to be better in they way.

For somo students is hard to make that decition.

But when they have the oction and they can do it is a good thing because they can learning more about and have more opportunities when they graduate from schools thay have good jobs and more oction to choose.

Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions. For somo of then is hinder to go and pick that oportunities.

Instance when students live far fom schools is hard to get there they need like a car to get there, but parents are allways insist to students to go to schools not matter how hard is all they wants is a good future for they childrens.

School is a personality decition in life, butsmart decition for people who is looking for good oction in life. Ertheless who finish school have more oction the people who don't finish. During school students need have to be inmate because schools is a hard time.

For students in schools is like stairway, because they walk aroung getting information, that is a good oction for teachers, to stall information and try to preparate students to then life. One way to be a perfectionist is graduste from schools.

Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those. Finally finish with right thing, Now is fancy work and alot oction to choose in life.                                                                                                          "
3452,EC7A73638669,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I agree with this position. I believe that it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college one year early. Although, some people think that it is not a good idea for students enter college or the work force one year early, nevertheless it can be helpful, because it can help students to start early to college, then they can have enough time to choose what they will want to study, and it also going to promote them to be eficients and take adventage of the time, they will have.

When people have to take a important decision, regularly, they think and they look carefully at all their options. If the students graduate one year early, they will earn time to correctly choose what profession they going to take, and then they will have enough time to elect the college or university where they feel comfortables to go. This is significant, because of one decision depend the future; the experiences that people going to live. With enough time students can give attention to their most important interests, thoughts, and consider possibles changes if it's require. Also people can take adventages of the time that they have, one year is not too much, but in one year is the opportuny for students to select a exceptional career and work and what they always dreamed.

The time is a investment and students have to take advantage of that. Some parents, students, and techers think that if the students graduate a year early, they don't will have time free to play, to share with their families, or to do others activities. The reality is that it going to improve the performance of the students. This method will catch the attention of them and it will show them their priorities. The children have the right to have their free time, but also the parents have the labor to teach them that are precedences that they have to comply with. For example, I took English 10, in summer school in Generic_City, but I was living in Generic_City, I drove every morning, one hour to arrive to my summer school, it was hard wake up early and then drive, but now, I'm sure that it was the best desicion because I'm at few steps of my graduation. People always have to remind that to can get extraordinary rewards, people have to do extraordinary efforts.

On the other hand, some people are not agree with those that offer the special program to graduate early. The opposition believe that students are not sufficiently prepare to graduate before of the schedule time. The contrary side, also think that students have to complete all their high school years to be ready to go to the college or the work. People that is in the opposite side not coincide with the programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years. In addition, some parents are not agree with the options that the program give to their children; to take courses during the summer or in the evenings. Parents refer to this like ""a extra pressure to students."" There are people that suggest that the better choice is that the students complete their four years of high school; however, it can prolong that time for students to graduate.

To conclude, it's important emphasize that in certain cases the pressure is a tool that help people to protrude in their projects and in the life in general. When people take risks and they have the courage to do reality their goals, they going to achieve all of them. The time that people invest in positive accions are transcedent to achieve their goals. The program offer a essential support to students, that going to be useful and it going to show to students that they have the capacity of achive their goals, before that they believed, they just have to establish their academic purposes and demostrate that they have the capacity to achieve it. The program is a great oportunitty to grow and success, one year can be the big difference, and it can approach us closer of that dream."
1758,852C90E3FA05,"Yes, I'm agree. I'm agree because the success consists of keep trying without never loss the enthusiasm. You need to keep trying until you get what you want because that's the goal.

I will give you, and tell you what a pass through like a example. When I came to the United States; It was a may 21, 2014 (I thinks that's the correct day, I'm not sure). I was 13 years old, almost 5 years ago. I didn't know any English, but I said to myself, ""I'm never giving up, until i get it"". That was my goal. I learned some English, how to write it, and how to speak it, although I'm still learning it, but I keep going trying it without giving up, and the most important think is without losing the enthusiasm because if we want something, we need to keep going, and trying until we get it.

Some people think they can do it, and those people prefer to gave up, and NO! That's wrong. YOU NEED TO KEEP GOING UNTIL YOU GET IT, and NEVER GIVE UP! That's it. :)"

970,4A38761A2CBB,"I agree on Prime Minister Churchilll quote that ""success consist of failure,being successful"" can be a different of what people might think and solving their problem to overcome any challenges that blocking their ways to being to improve and motivate them selves as a person.

Success is not just a dream is a dedication to be engage in everyday activity also success also a role for humans to think whats ahead and not lookig back to seek old habits.

Failure doesn't mean just to give up dreams and ideas but it gives the choice of pushing it to the limits and overcome any challenges,failure can also help to motivate any hopesand being prepared for any challenge thats around. its like how to motivate others to support and encourage them to help what their need is.

Despite having failure its not a end of the world situation but a test for confidence,skills and improvement or being a leader of some sort of ideas and real life. its like My self taking a test i was more likely to be more nervous but i was really confident that i would pass my class than thinking of failing it. some people want to be successful to persue the happiness and they dont the others to help get on track as their skills improves and its crucial for them to think futher down the road whats their future going to be and some people doesn't want to loose enthusiam its like loosing a video game and gave up easily and just throw the console to the trash and never play again for the rest.

but some people want challenges becase they can think hard and improve and know their weakness as they progress every level and they dont want to get beaten they want to stay on the top.

3065,DA4E1BDBD778,"What Ralph Emerson say,sometimes it could be a challenge for some adult but it is more then a challenge for teenagers,because since you are a children you know how your life is going to be.

If you grow up in a family who cares about you on what you do the whole day you know that you are lucky because not all people have the same family as you. When a teenager have a family who do not care about him he is going to end up having more problems them that one who have a good family. At this point this teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did with out their help or end up in jail. When the person don't have support from their family they do what they can so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family. That is what be yourself mean care about you and your family and give to your little brothes the opportunities that you did not have. Most people take that decision when they are teenagers,that is the most hard decision to make because you are living all your past behind and trying to work hard and never go back to the same place.

People who did take that decision when they where young they know how it feels be on that situation, they learn how to be themself and how a real man act. This world is for the people with strongest feeling weak people don't survive in this world. So to be yourself you have to be strong mind.

2878,D09D2C17FB38,"Does your teenager have a curfew? Do you think they should have a curfew? Keeping teenagers safe is really important especially when it's dark out. Thing out in the world are not like they used to be. A city council is debating on a curfew adoption. If this curfew is adopted does this mean teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Will curfews keep teens out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives?

A city council is debating on an adoption of curfew for teens. Why are they debating about this adoption? The first reason is city council does not want teens getting hurt or putting themselves at risk at a young age. Second, they want to keep teenagers safe from the bad things out in the world. Lastly is they do not want trouble, some teens make bad choices about drinking and other stuff they should not do at a young age. That is why city council is debating a curfew adoption.

If the curfew adoption is adopted by city council, does it mean that teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Many people have different opinions. I also think it depends on why they are out. I would say they are not breaking any law if its for work or any emergency. They are also not breaking the law if they are with an adult because it is not like they are on their on there own. However if they are out to be hanging out with friends and partying stuff like that, yes the would be breaking the law. Does this mean if teens are out they are breaking the law? In some ways yes and in some ways no, it depends on why they are out pass the curfew.

Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere in young lives? First things first most teens would say that by having the curfew law its interfering with there lives. Teens would say that because they want to go out and have funny and other stuff. having the curfew law will keep teens safe and out of trouble because you never know what could happen. Another reason i would say keeps them out of trouble is because most teens like to leave the house at night with out their parents knowing. That is never something you should do. Teens should think, Is it worth the risk? A lot of things can happen even though you may think everything is okay and that nothing will happen, but that is what you think there might be a chance you could be wrong. Now teens should think, Do curfews keep them safe or does it interfere win there lives?

The city council's debate about the adoption of curfew for teenagers. Many believe it should be a law and others believe its should not be a law. They debate upon this law because they want to keep teens safe and do not want them to get hurt or in trouble at a young age. Will it mean that any teen on the streets after curfew is breaking the law? It Will probably depend on why they are out for example for work or for and emergency and unless they are with an adult. Some reasons other than that like to go to parties or hang with friends, is most likely breaking the law. Will this law keep teens out of trouble or interfere with there lives? Most teens opinions would be that this law is interfering with their lives. Some teens most likely parents will say it's to keep teens safe instead of risking themselves."
3668,F610B3CBF3DF,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better.

To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another.

Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse but it's a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected.

Having a couple of mistakes doesn't mean failure it means progress to be successful. Failure will play an important role during the journey of success but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isn't perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful."
77,05CE0C0C5102,"Is it a good idea for student to finish high school in three years? Well I think that if student take three years to high school is that they know what they want to do in their life. Those student either want to go to college early, go the the work force, or start something from their passion. I am going to talk about three things of what I think about this prompt. Those things are students knowing they want to do in their lives, student not knowing what to do in their lives, or student just want to be done with school.

Student that take a three year high school plan, know what to do after those three years are up. They are determine to finish high school so they can finally start learning something that they have wanted to do. In those three years student are willing to finish any assignments on time and will at least get A's on their grades. They use their time wisely and always focus something to get it done. Once those are out of their way they are ready for the next step in their life.

Most students take a four year high school because they want to take time of what they want to do in their lives. The reason is, is that students just do not know what they want to do. Students just do not know what interest them so they have a hard time of their whole life. Some students just know what they want to do, but do not want to take a three year high school because it can be to stressful for them. most student will finish high school and can continue to college wandering what to do.

If a student ether take a three or a four year high school maybe just want to be done with school in general. those students may just think that college maybe just not worth the time, some just dont have the money to pursuing college. Those student may just know what to do and know that college is just not needed for that and is just a waste of time. They could have the resources already to pursuit the things that they want to do and so they are prepared for what is coming.

To put it all together, make sure choose what is best for you wither it is a three year high school plan, or a four year high school plan. In those years student have got to prepare for them selves if they are taking a three year there is going to be a lot of work being done so they can graduate early.

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,

''Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.""

I would have to say that i agree with his statement because as a high school student i like to go beyond on what i already know what to do. Emerson wants yous to take another step in what we do he wants us to grow wont you? knowing that we are capable of doing something so much bigger and better and just be able to grow in are generation. Success is something that every6 high school student wants to do we want to get better at something, we want to pass are classes and if we are not willing to go beyond and put forth effort then i dont think we will be able to grow.

High school is a great way to show this especially if your a student athlete; lets say that you play baseball or softball or any other type of sport that takes time to master. Playing a sport is not easy especially if you want to get a scholarship. I get ask this question all the time ""have you yet mastered being a Cather and going beyond that point to see what you have in stored?"" I have mastered the skills of a softball catcher but i know if i go beyond that point and keep practicing i know that i will be a great softball player in my years to come. Believing in your self to do something can also help you grow, just being able to say I got this and giving it all you got just gets you a step closer to becoming a master and growing into it. Another this is mistake those are alright , no one is perfect everyone is going to have there flaws and thats ok thats another way of growing and learning; won't you want to go beyond something you already mastered and try something new to grow?

Emerson wanted us to read this quote and think about what it meant to us. I ready this quote and it gets me to think "" so if i go beyond on my catching and try something else i could grow into the sport and play multiple positions on the field instead of just one."" I could also say the same thing about JROTC in my school as being part of the drill team and going to competitions. These are good examples on what we can all think about going beyond d and farther in what we already know an think about what we can do better so we can grow and learn from are mistakes. High school is a great place to start not even then you can start when ever you want just make sure you know what you want to do and just have fun and enjoy your life. The quote can also be for adults, who have already mastered in something like for example my father, he created his own software and designed it for offices and he is out of town right now in Generic_City so that he can install it and, just grow from that experience he is going beyond on what he dose at work and just making something great happen.

The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ,""unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you go this prompte and you read it and you have to pick if you agreed or disagree what would you pick? what would you tell me to make me agree or disagree with you? You tell me if i was right or wrong for agreeing with him. you will also be a great person in society. "
721,37A8D06A04AC,"What do you think about benefits of working with a group or working alone? Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment. And games can make for students likely work together to create atmosphere funny, if they working with a atmosphere new, they could be give some ideas faster and learning better. Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be?

Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they don't want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers don't teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are. When Bill Gate was young, him learning about software and computer, when him did not have more idea. Bill Gate told friends about working with him, Bill Gate said: We could be create something new about software and computer. After two years, they could be create the new computer and software. Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost.

Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they don't know where you fail when you writing essay. That's why we need a group can fix your fail and make you do better in your job. When you working with a group, you can learning some ideas your friends talking and the way they working. Danial Williams Hale said: Everything you learn, everything you practice, it's would be help you some case.

If you like working with a group, you can learning skill about your friends, you will be easy to successful on the goals. Like playing games, they need a team working together, if one people in a team like working alone, they can make your team loser. If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country. If in the world, we don't working together, maybe the world war three will be occur and the peaceful never got in the world. And we will never know culture of another country.

In general, working a group can make students learning about how to work together and give an ideas best. And can be understand more about the life with people in group, can share problem and working better. If you teaching for your son or daughter working together, when they grow up, they can brainstorm better and faster. However, If they knew how to working with a group, they can create one company and system. They will leader a company grow up and never go down."
2568,BEFA85A6134B,"Have you ever come across of asking people for an advice if so great. Asking people for an advice is a good way to see what is good and bad. Why cause if you do something stupid your going to regret it. The good part is that it's gonna be for something that your gonna get better at. If so lets say your having a hard time baking a cake and you ask for someones help. The person you ask for help might say "" Don't bake that cake for to long and use less eggs"". So in that case you learn from the mistake and now you know how to bake a cake.

First of all it's great for asking an advice cause you can ether learn from it. When something wrong your friends are there to tell you what to do or what no to do. Cause if you dont ask people for there option it can mess you up. Let's say your about to fight someone without no one concern. If you would of ask for an advice they would of told you ""Dont fight fighting is not the way to go just stay with me you'll be fine"".

Asking for an advice is the way to go less getting in trouble.

Secondly advises can take you far in life you might say how it's just words, but each words have meaning. You remembering what people tell you in situation. Remembering the words they told you and you wont be in that same situation cause you learn from your last mistake. The word that can take you far in like is ""Tell me who you your hanging around with, i'll tell you who yo really are"". That sentence is strong cause it keeps you thing what your doing with your friends and what have you been do. Just ask for an advice to no get in trouble and be a great person in the world.

Lastly advises are great way to show that you care about someone cause not everyone is there for each other. Other might not care your going threw tough time, but ask people for an advice to not to anything stupid or something your gonna regret in the future. Another thing try to asking other people for an advice cause two is better then one. Remember don't do something stupid there are people around you that want to help you in your goods and bad. Lastly be smart of what your gonna do its not gonna hurt you if you talk to someone and get an advice from an old person.

In conclusion, asking people for an advice is great cause it can help you in situation. Such as good and bad there are always time your gonna need to talk to someone. Always ask for help never stay quite cause cause your gonna do something your gonna regret. How I hope I showed you what is good for asking an advice and the pros and cons."
2952,D4269468970A,"I agree with honesty because it's good to be honest and make people trust you and believe in you and because you have honesty it will get you friends and teachers will like you as a student. And also it is respectful to be honest and if it's your friend or family I think you should be honest because it's your friend and they probably wouldn't care what you say if it's mean because they probably know that you don't mean to be mean and that your just being honest with them.

But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someones feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if your not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend or they will dislike you a little bit.

But if i could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someones feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someones day and make things better for them.

In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not. But you have to be careful on what you say with honesty or not because depending on what you say it could be a big situation for you if you say something wrong."
3171,DF111089EFA4,"We have to work to survive. Employers give us the opportunity to work and to overcome different financial problems. Many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. Some companies have internships and shadowing opportunities that helps student to find out their interest. Schools should have partnership with compamies because it helps students to get ideas about Work environment, work skills, and jods requirement

The partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. Then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. Studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. Students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. They suffer to select their jobs. On the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. They are heading toward in college as well as their jobs.

Work environment is very importent. Different people like different work environment. We should select the job that attends our demands. Some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. Internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. Some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. Also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment.

All jobs have some requirments. All the jobs do not have same requirements. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. Internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. With these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation. People may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. By internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty.

In conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. It is a great way for the students to build up their future. This opportunities gave students ideas about jobs they should select. The informations help students to be successfull in their career life."
3498,EEED5054938E,"I

would disagree for adding a one hour and a half hour because maybe parents might be worried about their child or children at school for another hour or two. I would say why would students want another hour of school if they just want to go home and see their family. i would even say that i would not want another hour of school cause isn't seven hours of school enough already. I can understand if teachers want to see their students even more maybe but maybe they have to email their students parents before having to get the extra hour of school. What i would say is that all the students should vote online or in public to see if they all want to have a extra hour or half a hour still because it can`t be the parents only because it`s not fair for the adults to decide if they have to get another hour or two the students have to decide because they are the ones that are gonna have the extra hour.

I

understand that kids might want to do activities for their school or they can stay after school to do it like, assignments,homework,projects,PowerPoints,tests,and quizzes. I usually would`nt want to have another because it`s complicated sometimes doing stuff there and it is just to much for me to handle at one time mostly and i have to do a lot stuff at home also so i rather not have another hour of school cause it`s a lot. If he or she doesnt want to stay they dont have to vote or say anything but other people might say something if they do want to have the extra hour or two i would speak up for himself or herself cause if u do want the extra hour or two go ahead vote or speak up for yourself and do your best to change the idea of the story or idea of the other people that would not have the extra hour. Now back to my disagreement about having another hour of school i would not have another hour of school because it is it much work for me to handle mostly cause the amount of work i have to do at school is so ridiculous really ridiculous cause the person or me has to write alot form time time and its worth it cause your getting a free education but i dont want alot of education i would want to stay me and me only.

3817,FC211F7815F2,"Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement, is to start an afterschool homework club. Students stays for homework help, finish their homework early, and turn in their homework on time. So ,we all have our homework to turn in on the next day. They're a lot of students that do their homework, dont do it, or some students might said, ""I forgot my homework.""

Should people bring their homework to school? Of course, or what, you're just going to leave it at your house and forget to bring it at school. Always do your homework and do your homework at home or afterschool. On the next day, just prepare to turn in your homework and if you forget to bring your homework, ask your teacher and give a good reason why you left your homework. Then you can turn in your homework on the next day.

People need help on their work. That's why they needed an afterschool homework club. They can go to their teacher to help what they need. If they go to afterschool and get a good helper, then they can be better and will know what they learn at afterschool. We can improve all of the students to get a good knowledge and success, to be a good students.

So students needs to turn in their homework and get a good grade. So, if you want that grade, you have to achievement and pass the class and get good grades. Turning your homework is one of the important grades to success and go your grade up. You can help other students that needs help on a subject. Why, because helping someone will learn from you and they will know how to solve a problem. They might do something and turn in. That's why people needs a good grade and be smart on something they known.

Now that the students have an afterschool, they can go and learn what they need help on something. Then they can remember, how to do a problem. We all can be nice and treat like if its like you."
1226,5F370D929BA7,"Would be good too that the younger students can be able to go to some schools of the older students, because they can learn how the High Schools goes and they can learn either what classes they are going to like.

When students go to different schools they can talk with their parents to what school looks better and if they liked or not and he can choose the classes that he wants and talk with their parents if that class is good or not.

They are going to be happy because they choose the classes that he have the chance to choose the classes for themselves.

Some students have a program that pairs older students with younger students. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

Is good that the students go to the schools but most will be the one's that are in the middle schools for what for nothing is good that the students that are in middle schools they are going to high school because they can talk with the teachers about the class and what is going to be about.

Can be good for some students because when get's the time to go to high school they can be sure what is going to be about the classes the he choose and all that stuff.

They are going to liked because they have the opportunity to choose their classes and for some reason is going to be more fun and the students wants to learn more about what is the teacher talking about because they choose them classes.

Sometimes the students don't know what classes they want to take when they go to high school because some students say that is hard to be in high school it is but you need to think that if you wanna do something hard you need to work hard and you can due because if you don't try you are not going to do something.

Sometimes the students don't like to help themselves but doing this can be helpful for them because they are going to say to themselves "" wait but is going to be cool choose my classes "". And they are going to want choose them classes and and they can learn what classes they can choose.

They are going to be very happy because they decided to help themselves.

They are going to help others students and see what they due and what they are learning.

Helping other students is good they don't need to be at school but I don't like this class what can I do to changed but I can't changed it help them and they are going to be happy.

Always try to help other because they are going to be the future of this world we need to help them to find the solution of everything. "
513,26EA99485576,"The key to success is your attitude. Studies show that your attitude is your key to success in life because it represents you. The key to success is a positive attitude because one can accomplish more, one can get the respect they need and its your first impression to someone.

First, staying positive will let you accomplish more things in life. For Example, It can help you accomplish getting a job, finishing school work and getting into colleges.

Next, with positive energy it will help you get through the day much smoother. Also, you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.

Next, staying positive lets people know that you respect others. This allows you to get a good images in any environment. When getting good images people would be interested in giving you job opportunities. Also, when showing good attitude and respect could lead to success in life.

Also, when getting a job you need to always stay positive to show your first impression to your boss. First impressions show how someone thinks of you and determines if you get the job or not. If you dont show positive attitude, then you probably wont get the job and it shows bad first impression.

In conclusion, the key to life is your attitude and the only person who can control it is you. Studies show that your attitude determines your success in life. So, now you know why staying positive is a key to success in life by accomplishing more, respecting others and first impressions."
2473,B7FABBC13A0F,"""Character is something what you yourself choose to make it""

I agree with John Lubbock because our character is something we make by ourselves. We make ourselves the person we become in the future. We choose our traits and characters by ourselves. Everyone has a right to choose what's best for themselves. Some people choose worst traits but others choose good. It depends on ourselves what we want to be in the future. Although some traits in a character of a person comes from experiences and most of the time bad traits comes from the worst experiences in our life. But it is completely our choice if we want to make those bad experiences a process of learning and learn something good from them. Some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences that's how most of the people get their worst traits. It is not wrong to say that people choose what they want to be and how they want their life. It is true that some traits are formed beyond our control but it depends on ourselves if we want those trait in our characters or not.

Some people get too comfortable with bad traits and they don't want to change their selves for example lying is a worst trait anyone can possibly have it leads to do things that we don't even want to do but we do it anyways because we get comfortable and have no fear. ""Lying is not better than silence"" so it is way better to not say anything than lie about it. Lying is something that leads to other bad traits like dishonesty. If a person is not honest than they are not trustworthy. Trust is something very important because it is extremely hard to gain.

If a person is not trustworthy than there is nothing they can do other than try not to lie. Trust is like a glass if it breaks it will never be the same. All these problems are caused by lying and it depends on our to choose if we want to lie and make ours characters full of worst traits or be a better person choose good traits. In this world there is nothing more important than being who we are and choosing best for ourselves.

Our characters can formed by influences beyond our control for example something bad that happened in the past can lead a person to lie and being dishonest. Lying is not something to be proud of and bad experiences doesn't give anyone the right to lie because it doesn't matter. There is a huge difference between right or wrong. We choose our traits and what we want our characters to be like by ourselves we should know what's good and bad for ourselves. Even though sometimes being honest and speaking truth can lead to difficult situations and most people don't want to deal with difficult situations which is okay but it is important to do something right. Difficult situations make a person stronger and traits like honesty will make us proud of ourselves in future. Most of times its the journey that matters the most than the destination because it not about how we choose to become a better person it is about the experiences that led us to who we will be in the future. It is about how some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences but others learn good things from them. It is true to say that we become what we want to be and we choose our traits by ourselves. The harder the path will be the stronger the person becomes so it depends on ourselves to choose good or bad. There will be always two paths one will lead to good and other will lead to bad although our it depends on our own selves to choose from right or wrong,good or bad the choice is ours. If we want to be become something we'll be proud of or something we will be ashamed of. We write our stories by ourselves so it is all on in our hands what we want to be.

Although some people might disagree and yes it is true that our characters can formed by influences beyond our control but it depends on us what we want to be. Everyone knows the difference between right or wrong. There will be consequences of choosing bad and sometimes it will be easy to not be brave and choose the worst traits for ourselves. It is completely your decision if you want to add good traits in your personality or bad traits. The difference between Joker and Batman is that Batman chose good traits while Joker turned himself evil by choosing bad traits. Even though tragic experiences led Joker to be evil but his past didn't give him the right to be evil. So,you can't be evil because of your past and becoming a better person or having good traits will lead to a better future because it past is past and future is something to look forward to. Traits like honesty and being able to do what's right without any fear will make us proud of ourselves in the future. Everyone wants to be proud of themselves and to make that possible they need to adapt good traits. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves. Bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is important to choose good traits.

In conclusion the person we choose to become today will reflect on our future selves whether we choose good or bad traits. The decision is ours and what we want to be ourselves to be like it totally depends on us. Most of the problems in our lives can be solved by choosing good traits over evil. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves while bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is very important to choose good traits. If you want to be proud of yourself then it is a must to choose good traits. Our traits make our characters and personalities. Some people make their life miserable by choosing what's worst for them like bad traits. It is important for ourselves to choose good rather that ruin our lives with choosing something like bad traits. A person can ruin their character by choosing bad traits. That's why it is extremely important to choose good traits for ourselves because it is good.               "
3625,F48D7BBAF52D,"Do you think that have a positive attitude is the key to success in life?

Some people think that have a positive attitude is definitely helpful to get a greatest accomplishment, when we longing to be someone in life you need to have two important things; positive attitude and courage to be what you want to be it does not matter what is you career is, if you don't have a positive attitude you will be nothing in life, a expert of university said, ''Have a positive attitude for students is very important when they decide to go a college, it will help them to get their career done easily.''

Have a positive attitude is good because it make you to do things better in life, it make you feel proud of you , you positive attitude help other people to feel positive, to feel with a good attitude, and to feel them comfortable with you, have a positive attitude it help you everywhere, anytime, and every single day of your life.

Many people today have a positive attitude that help them many time to get gretest complishment, the positive attitude help me on many ways one of this is that it help me to get gretes things like to get my job that I have now and have a good grade at school and transmit my positive attitude to others students.

In conclusion, have a good positive attitude is something that help you up every day, a lot of people get gretest success in life through positive attitude, in other words, if we have a good possitive attitude we can obtain great things to reach our dreams, but this depent of what we want to be , what we want to reach."
633,305EFA6DBBBF,"Do we choose our own character traits?

As the British naturalist and politican Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves', they're capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be.

Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.' everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example;

My grandma, she's a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, she's a very independent women who always says, ""If i don't do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times.

Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be.

Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character it's really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but that's like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be.

In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

1964,946D8B23ECA6,"I agree with Albert Einstein when he said that imagination is more important than knowledge. within you knowledge comes you imagination. in that imagination you see that it will help you receive your knowledge from somewhere that you did imagined. even tho sometime you imagination can mess your Brain a little when you go ahead of yourself. Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself.

but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test you've taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read.

but there're time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together,

but still there're some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend.

imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or he'll stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money.

young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun."

But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano.

A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use.

There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts people's taste of music because some people are different."
301,161E5C8A6719,"Studies has been showed that students that been committing to their dream career before entering high school would be most likely to get their career more successful than other students. However, it'll be a stressful/pressure thing for students because they would have to achieve it faster than others. The issue of students committing to a career at a young age is a stressful, mental thing, should not be considered because students would be more stress, they would focus on their future career and not themselves and high school makes everyone change their minds.

My firsts reason why students should not commit to their career at a young age is because they would be more stress throughout high school. Yes, high school seems like an easy place to stick to your future career but at the same time it's really not. If you commit to your career throughout high school, your're more likely to be stress because you feel like okay if i do this i'll achieve faster but not at the same time if i do this i won't be achieving. So technically you just put yourself in a position that you really can't get yourself out of. You're focus on one thing that in your other classes it's hard to think or studied about. Yes, committing is easy but it's not. Its's high school the place where your education change you. You would probably change your mind no time soon. Therefore, don't put yourself in the position to be stress.

Pressure is a main key to everything nowadays because it's ""fun"". However, it is not. Being put on pressure is the most hardest thing to be in because you feel like you have to do it to make someone or somebody proud. Like in this case your future career. You feel like you're pressure because you want to make your parents, teacher, your school admins proud and know that you can really commit to things. As days or weeks goes on, the pressure level goes up and up and when that goes up you kinda get depressed, sad and not yourself because you are doing this for them and not you.

High school changes everyone mind. As soon as, you walk into high school it's not the typically high school movie you think. It is place where students and teachers minding their selves and doing their know things. Middle school vs. High school are two different place. The classes are harder, high school have many many electives to pick from so like of course you are going to change so like why would you want to stick to your career at a young age when your haven't taken those other classes. Like your never know what you actually like when you have tried taken those classes.

In my personal opinion i would not commit to career at a young age. i learned from experiences and from other. Take the classes that you like in high and if you like keep moving on. If not, move to a different one. What your see on TV is not want you see in reality. So again in my opinion

Everyone is different, you are different. career is just a word. Don't push yourself at a young age. "
1817,88FD7FAAFA90,"Some school require students to complete summer projects. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Second they would put more effort and time on the project. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy.

To start with, summer projects should be student designed. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project.

Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength they'll aim for that A on the project. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about.

Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed.

Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged.

To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring. "

1322,655BD307F87D,"Many students in high school are looking for the way to reduce their time in school, there are several reason for students to think about it. These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason.

In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school.

In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation.

Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money.

The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general.

The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need."

Mae by there grades are low and he or she want her grades not to be low he or she will do extra study for 30 minutes. The total time is for studying is 2 hours and 30 minutes and that is 8:30 pm.

904,45697CF2448C,"Do you like to extend your school hours?

I think extending the school hours do your life more easier because you don't have to do homework at home. You can do your homework in the school and you can ask for help.

I agree with extending the school day because I like go to the school and you have more time to stay with your family because you don't have to do your homework.

My first reason is I like to extending the school day because when the teachers give you homework you can do it in the class, and I like it because you can have more time to stay with your friends.

By this I mean, when I come back to my home I don't have to do any homework because I do my homework in the school and I can go outside and play with my friends. This is why is good to have more hours of school.

For example, one day I was in the school, and my science teacher give me so much homework, she told me I need to do projects, quizzes, and extra work but I told her I can't do it because I don't have internet at home and I can't do my homework in the school because I don't have so much time because the school end early. I go to the school principal and I asked him if he can extend the school day because many students need more time to do their homework and then a few week ago he told me,"" I want to expend the school days because I was thinking and you are right."" I feel happy in that moment because I will have more time to do my homework and pass the grade.

Conclusion, extending the school hour can help you to do your homework and missing work, and you don't need to do it at home.

My second reason is I like to have school hours because you have more time to eat and when you do your testes you can study one hour and not is a matter because you still have time to do your test.

By this I mean I have more time to eat my lunch and talk with my friends in the cafeteria, and when I have testes I do it with more calm, and I don't stressful because I have time to do my test.

To illustrate, I was in the school, and I was doing my math test and I was so hungry and I asked my teacher if I can ate and he said "" No because we don't have a lot of time, and we need to finish the test."" I was so mad because I was hungry, and we don't have time to ate. When the test finished we go to ate and then we have to go to another class but I was so tired because them don't give us time to rest .

To wrap up, you need to have time for everything and do the thing with calm. Is good if the school extend the school hours because you have time for do your homework, your quizzes, or your projects.

To wrap up, the school need to extend the school day because like this every student will have time to do what they need to do in their classes, and they don't have to worry about the homework in their houses.

I feel if the school extend the hours should be great and more peaceful because you can because you can do your work and other things with more tranquility.

I think if in your school extend the school hours you have more time to do your homework, and you can have more time to stay with your family."
3232,E1DB041DD77B,"The statement positive attitude is the key to success in life is true,the attitude is important in life. No one want to live their life with the negative way that not good for everyone, their family, and everyone around them. Let thinking about that when you have positive attitude and good energy and give it to everyone first thing you got is people will love you because that make people feel comfortable when near by, they feel your positive energy you giving to them,and you will have a good friendship when you give them the best feeling they need after all the problem, stress in their life. The second thing is that make yourself happy, life is tired you will not happy if always have a negative attitude in life, no one can make you happy except yourself. The last one is some people think they are having very bad life, they always get the worse thing than other people, and they want to give up but if they looking around them they are not the one have the baddest life. Follow that way you will never become success.

When you do a good thing make everyone happy and you will feel like you are so cool, you are very good, anyway you will feel happy because you was did a good thing and when they happy they will give their love, their respect. They like you and when you get in trouble they will help try their best to help you without your money like the way you make them happy. Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life.

I am very sure most of us learn from teachers and parents are always the positive way and positive attitude, they will not teach you some thing bad and negative, what is mean? That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they can't go with you or following you forever. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way.

People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. Why people always say never give up or you don't know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just don't take your chance and your time to finish your dream. For example you think you don't know or not good at anything, why you don't try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up.

in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier don't make you life become too hard. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally don't give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success.

3493,EEB5AAA18E11,"Some people believe that student should be required to take a class in the arts, Or student should take classes such as elective ?

Imagine doing something that makes you happy, An doing something your comfortable at an decide what are your capable of doing in life. People believe that each student should required an electives in school cause people believe that this will help the students find what they want to do, Also this will help them find they skills an get opportunities, And importantly this will helped students in future .

Its really important that students should pick any electives they want to do, Imagine students get an electives they dont want to do. This will have the student feel lazy going to class, An when student feel lazy going to class student mostly skip class. When student skip class students will have a bad grade, An when students get a bad grade they get irritated. And they dont have the motivation so they give up and when students give up they will not receive any credit an students needs enough credit to graduate if a student dont graduate high school the students cant go to colleges. An the student cant have a better job , Also companies would not hire them. people who has no job they could be homeless an its very hard. So this is why it's very important students decide what electives they want to do.

People believe that everyone has their special skills. Students should find they skill taking the electives they really good at cause if a student is good at something they will love to go to class, Also going to class will have student have good grades and would like to learned more things and importantly you will receive an credit. An taking the class they good at will have a lot of benefit an opportunities in life, Cause people who has a lot of skill, Most people would love students to work in their companies. For example if students is good at drama company will hire them as an actress an people will get famous, Also have their own movie an this will makes a lot of money out of it . also not only a student can only have one skill you could have a lot of skill just not one but more, An this will help a student. If a student has a lot of experience an know a lot of things this will definitely help them. This one of the reason that students should find their skills .

Future is very important for the students cause when a students who takes electives and doing the electives they like an love to do students would take this opportunities to have a good future after graduating high school, Also College cause this when their adult life would begin and things will be different. And this why its very important student take their skill so future would not be hard it would be easy for students, It would have a lot of hard an rough times but with the skills they would get through it . Also this is when the student begin their dreams, An student could use the skills for a better future and things would not be hard for them cause students would know what they doing and what is going to happen also most student would find their destiny, An their destination they would love to be at.

But also people may think that student may not required electives cause students its not motivate enough to take it, An students dont really wanna do it, And mostly students will take it as a joke."

There could also be another example with that, a family reserves a table on the best expensive restaurant in Generic_City and as soon as the family sits down they all go on their phones, even the parents gave that example instead of them wanting to have a nice family dinner. Families lose the connection due to cell phones because just like that family had a date with their phones and not with their own family the connection starts to decrease and after all that it'll be hard to have that open conncetion with your family. That's consider a threat because you're letting the use of technology define how your family will be or do things in there lives. It could also be a positive effect because and not all families struggle with the addiction to technology, people such as; doctors, judges, lawyers, businessman, etc... They have a job and the best way to keep in contact with people that need of them, they have to always be using their cell phones or computers to be in touch with them no matter where or what they are doing. But that shouldn't be any excuse not to have a family time, family comes over everything, you can't miss moments with your family or else you'll regret it in the future you'll just remember being on the phone that entire time. Don't let technology control you or your family.

Love could also vanish do to the lack of commitment with your phone. Relationships now a days are very different from back then, they don't get to be more romantic well they could but maybe through texting. The love they had for each other could easily be broken do to social media, either the guy or the girl could possibly find someone else and cheating happenes, I know that does not the whole reason why but it does affect you in a way. Let's talk about Khloe Kardashian, she being a famous women had to receive the bad news of her baby dad cheating on her moments before she gave birth. In some cases couples don't get to enjoy their date because one of them is in there phone. I've seen that breaking up through text is the biggest excuse for a men or woman, if social media didn't work like it does now there woulndn't be a lot of cheatings. Social media could also be used for good, if you are in a long distance relationship you have the opportunity to talk to your significant other across the world and also because you get to know someone you might marry in the future. But is still bad, social media causes a lot of things to happen such as suicide or having eating disorders or even bulling.

Technology has a negative effect on most kids in elementary, middle or high school. Back then you woulnd't see little kids having the latest phone, because the new generation that is coming is more open minded about how ""society"" works. There might be things I don't even know and yet you ask a seven year old kid and they know it already, Society has changed a lot from when I was a little girl to how kids are now. KIds are mostly connected on their phone most of them just want to stay home and play Fortnite, not only kids play that all grown ups which makes them looks so childish in my opinion, while before they would really want to go outside to play any sports they could. Little kids having phones at there early age makes them have bad grades in school because there main focus is texting, videos, or video games which don't take them anywhere. The percentage of students having good grades has decreease in a way that surprises you. how many times you see little babies asking for their paretns phone and what do parents do, they give them there phone because they can't control their children what will make them obey is technology. In some way it could be good because they get the chance to have more opportunities in school wise, like having computers in our home helps get your grade up if you use it wisely, some parents don't have the money to buy their kid a computer while schools does provide some don't take a good opportunity. Just look at how children are attached to there phones. Focusing in school will give you so much opportunities that will take you on a greater point in your life and I feel like that is what we need to make all of them understand.

In conclusion, Is good to have technology but don't use it to hurt people which will take them to commit suicide or having eating disorders. Cherish every moment you get to have with your loved ones don't let technology control who you are or who you can be. People don't have the same human contact anymore because they are more worried that they'll get a text that they need to respond as soon as possible. Live every moment to the fullest you never kknow what could happen in ten minutes or the next day.      "
260,12F89E196E97,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are actually doing."" Idle refers to people who are not busy or keeping themselves occupied to their powers or implements. You would think being inactive serve a purpose, but personally i think it does not. To be occupied gets you to accomplish a lot in life. People who do not keep themselves busy tend to not get far in life.

In other words, to not be engage in work or activity is a very poor thing;there could be plenty of opportunities for you, but just because you are inactive you could miss these awesome opportunities. When we lack the ability to work or to keep ourselves occupied we are being inadequate. People who do not push or work themselves never actually really make it anywhere in life. Therefore, if we are always ""doing"", we will not fail to meet our expectations. If athletes were never idle or always ""doing"" some of them would of never made it in life.

However, inactivity does not serve a purpose because when you are inactive or simply not doing anything you miss out on what life has to bring you. We would accomplish so much if we always kept ourselves busy neverless. People who lack strength or courage are inactive. So when teachers say use your time wisely they are telling you to be Idle. It is wonderful when you are doing, being active, or pushing yourself because when you do these things you never miss out on any opportunity.

Lastly, when you are Idle you serve a purpose for yourself, family members, and you encourage others around. People who are active push themselved to do better. Being active can get you a good job because people will speak highly of you and recommend you to others. You ever heard of ""hard work makes the dream work"" when you put yourself to work anything is possible. Your peers around you will look up to you because you get stuff done and it would push them to do as you do.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson says when you are determined never to be Idle you serve no purpose and you are determined to get knowhere in life. Keeping yourself occupied can get you to places in life where you thought you could never be because you are putting the effort. People who move with no purpose are called lazy people these people do not accomplish as much as those who work. Thomas Jeffersom is right to be Idle is wonderful to those who put in the effort and try their best no matter what. Anything is possible as long as you are always at work."

2295,AB7823891008,"I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age.

My first response is some children can commit to a career at a young age, if they want to improve and they want a good future, they have to go to school and many of children can helped from their parents.

For example; if someone want a career at young age they have to work hard, and pay attention, some time is going to be difficult for them but they can do it.

Children engage in a career at a young age to prepare themselves for their future .

Also, is a good idea for students to a career at a young age because they are improve in a good age and they thinking about their future, but in a career at young age some children want to graduated at a young age, first they have to work hard at school, and there are many way, and programs to be graduated from Hig School for a career at a young age.

In conclusion, kids who take advantage of programs, and High Schools, are qualifying these students for their lives ahead in order to have a good future with a career they want. I definitely think that programs make a positive input in these helping young life.

2215,A50D4A87B19D,"I agree with this statement because people can learn from mistakes lets say that I got a bad grade on my quiz and my teacher let me retake the quiz and I do well so I learn what to do better on my quiz by studying and doing my work , and no one is perfect so we do a lot of mistake but we can learn from them, try not to make the same mistake that people do around the world have made because you made a mistake dose not mean that you have failed but you can still keep going and that, at the same time I kinda disagree with it at the same time because some time you don't even now what to do at the same time they will rejected people if peopel fail there quiz so some time they will reject people from what they did so I am kinda at the middle part because sometimes you can win and lose at the same time.

That there are better thinkings people can do you best lets say that I lost against this guy on a game really can't be mad at the same time because you to show respect not get mad at the same time so at the same time you got now more about the other person people.

Because helps me get better at things ,it teaches me new things that I didn't even know about, and also helps me grow smarter and as a better person. Learning from someone like my Dad.

Hearing wisdom from my Dad will definitely make me a better and smarter person. Because it will make me motivated to think like him and be like him . It will also make me work and study harder so I can get to where his telling me to. And not only I could be like my Dad one day I could probably be a better person and smarter person than him. Because my Dad would push me to work as hard to be the best.

Learning new things from someone that has an experience like my Dad can help me have more better ideas about what I'm doing . And it gives me an open mind about new ideas that I didn't even know about. It also helps me create new ways how to do stuff. And will also gives me better techniques and more ideas. So in the future I can try to change and try different things from what I have learned from my Dad.

It's also really important for my Dad to give me his wisdom, Because I can't imagine doing stuff without someone helping me on things that I don't even know about. It just helps me to stay more focus in my work by just hearing from someone Like my Dad. It makes me want to try harder than other people and be better than them. And lastly it will make me think smarter and push my self to be the best I could be.

So I think it's kinda obvious that every person or even smart people needs help sometimes from someone thats has an experienced before. Because by just hearing from them will teach you new ways new ideas and even stuff you didn't even know existed. Everyone is not perfect in this world and everyone definitely needs helps on something it doesn't have to a big thing it can be a very small things. But I think by just hearing from someone that has an experienced before will definitely help you to be better person.    "

Which attitude should you make to let your day continuing to be a great day? You get angry and ruin everything, or you give a bright smile and make a nice conversation. Your positive attitude definitely gives you an energy to show your enthusiasm in daily activities. A short fact in Generic_School, students enjoy to go to the library before the class starts, because there is a big welcome from those librarians. They always smile, explain or help you when you need. A simply good morning with a pretty can make you feel today is going to be a great day, then you may pass their great attitude to someone else that you do not even know. Life is stressful, but your positive attitude will change stressful life to a sweet life.

In addition, you want everything in your life go smoothly, you need a perfect attitude for yourself to looking for a fitting path.

2001,973B1ACD7430,"Imagine going to a school that has a longer student release time then any other school, imagine feeling tiered and restless everyday you come home from school, well the school board is about to make that ""dream"" happen for this school.

The school days should not be extended because most of the students will not have a plesent time spending more hours in school, for example most students at the end of the school day feel tiered and they just want to go home and sleep, if an extra hour gets added to the school day most of the students will be angry and agitated.

A second reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because it will be confusing for parents, it will be confusing for parents because most parents have a specific time that they pick up their kids and when the time changes for the students release, parents will get confused and it will be a disaster.

A finial reason why an extra hour shouldn't be added is because after school courses will be longer, this will be a issue for after school buses because they will have to change their whole schedule for picking up students in the afternoon.

In conclusion, students shouldn't have to have an extra hour added to their school days, and the school board should keep everything the same. "
986,4B957C430005,"'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I agree that it is the best thing to accomplishment because it makes that person become independent, helps you succeed and gain confidence, and gives you strength to help others out.

In addition, being yourself helps you succeed through so much, it helps you become independent to take care of your own actions. Being independent is the best thing why?. Well because it's better to accomplish your goals on your own instead of depending on another person you aren't going to have that person always by your side. People come and go not really just any person sticks by your side like that. This is why doing things yourself, achieving your goal is the best thing, you can show people that you don't need any ones help because you got yourself and that's all you need.

Also, being yourself motivates you to do better, you start to gain confidence and nothing is better than believing in yourself. Just how it's easy to gain weight it is also easy to gain confidence by telling yourself ''I can do this!.''

By having motivation you can do possibly anything, you can jump off a plane if you have the guts to. You start doing better in school or your job perhaps, you start getting good grades or start coming to work on time. Motivation is key in order to succeed in life you must have confidence.

In other words, once you start to gain confidence you need to have enough strength to help another person out perhaps they are depressed or it's just not their best time right now. Motivate them to never give up no matter how much stress you have it shouldn't give you a reason to just stop trying. We have to go through the rough times first in order to have a better life. If someone or yourself is having a really harsh time don't be pressed over it the past is the past and many things happen for a reason. I have gone through a rough time myself for 6 months now but it never gave me a reason to give up I am a strong independent woman and I won't ever stop trying to stop having confidence.

In conclusion, just how Author Waldo Emerson said '' To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' He is correct but, also making you into something else could also mean in a negative but we always need to have a positive mindset. We must be independent and have confidence so we can succeed and so we can help others succeed as well to become somebody in life. Never give up just be positive and everything will come your way remember confidence and motivation is key."
2307,ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself i'm graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool don't really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we won't even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we should'nt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didn't offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he can't do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and it's totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i should'nt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they did'nt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they should'nt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop. I'm very happy to say that i'm class of 2020!! instead of 2021, And i'm very happy that i took that road."

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future. Be able to choose a class is a good opportunity because it helps students to be intresting in new projects, know new things and obtain a good education at school. Obtaing a good education might encourage students to be succsessfuly in other classes and in other places."

First, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because when the person positive that will makes him/her have a lot of friends.

Some people may argue that to try to be a positive person because the world we born on sometimes have a lot of problems. That is true because the world looks like the mountain sometimes hard to claim it, and the life looks the same usually it's hard to be happy and positive because sometimes their is a problem or something happened makes you feel sad, and negative, and makes you feel that you hate your life, but everyone have to try to be positive, and to love his/her own life because if the person always negative that will makes him/her sick, sad, mad, and complicate.

Writing SOL

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters.

Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.   "
2575,BF580042A644,"The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. m and on the weekends they have until midnight. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. This rule would be an outstanding one because they can cause less trouble and they can stay out of trouble at the same time. This rule won't interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents don't have to worry about them doing anything bad. The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesn't go out passed his curfew then he or she won't get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. You won't have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and won't try to get you in a serious problem. It's also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. The city council can't really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid.

My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property. I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it.

My final reason why I think it's important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. We don't know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed,

to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they won't ask for it , so it's important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing.

This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well."

Also, working alone can be more beneficial because you can work at your own pace. Working at your own pace is very important, you will not make mistakes and if you do it is totally fine because that is where we learn from. You may be the type of person that likes working little by little every night instead of doing it all at once. You will not have people over your house horse playing instead of helping you out and working with you on your project. When working alone you do not have to worry about all these concerns because you will be the only responsible one for your own work.

Working alone is more beneficial and can be very helping, it will prepare you for the real world. When working alone you may write or put what you think is correct, your friends will not be there to tell you that you are incorrect. You might be a independent person and prefer to work by yourself. You do not have to worry about someone rushing you because you should know when the due date is. While working alone you just have to worry about you, and finishing your work of course.

Although, others may think it is more beneficial working with a group. Working with a group can bring a lot of distractions. Research determined that when it comes to group projects people complain and prefer to work independently. Also, why would you want to work with others if you do not know if they are in the same level as you. When working with a group you have to check up on your group members to see if they finished there part of the project, if they are not responsible enough to finish it themselves you have to fill in for them because it is a group project and project grade.

Does it not feel much better working alone? You can work at your own pace and we all do not have the same mentality, so we do not have to argue with anyone about putting your own ideas and what you think is correct. Let me tell you a little secret, working with a group can be pretty complicated. Always working alone, it is more beneficial.        "
1453,6FEF6D46714D,"Has it ever crossed your mind that people today are struggling to make their own decisions, and wanted feedback from other people and just maybe wanted to change their mind. Well people today are just going what their own decisions they make, I am the type of person to ask for some feedback or ask other people about, is this a good choice im making, can I do something better then what I did yesterday. I believe that people should take other peoples' guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter due to people wanting help in the real world, and also tell them about the past so they do not mess up on there life choices.

What is more important the choices you make or the outcome of it? Teenagers about my age need to make better choices, but why you may ask. Today Teenagers are just ruining their own life in school. Teens need to focus on what is right for them making better decisions, like not to drink, help mom out in the kitchen, and do something productive. Teens decisions now can affect the decisions they will make sometimes in the future. For example I changed one of my friends decisions to not drink because that will cause him in the long run, like ever makes it big and someone sends that picture to social media his life can be ruin. Therefore I think teens or people should also ask other people that have already or still is living for a better decisions in important matters.

Why should I go to someone else for a better decisions for some dumb reason they are going to give me, wrong. If you ask someone, you should actually listen to see what they have to say and understand the concept. It is better to have someone else opinion on how to change my decisions. Well they have lived longer than you have, they have more experience,and more life choice taking. All im trying to say is that in my opinion is that you should always take someone else decision because maybe it will help other people in the long run. Maybe it will lead them to build something amazing, start their brand company. Just something between those lines. Someone else decisions can actually change the person you are right now. I've had so many people bring me down on how I'am going to never make it the Army branch. I'm just gonna be a lawn mower, a person who just cuts grass for living. Even though they making money that not my passion. My recruiter told me to never let someone enter your head with bad thought and let them struggle you with these bad thoughts. One of his saying was ""yesterday was the past,today is the present,and tomorrow is a mystery"".

In conclusion People should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about matters due to people needing a little more help, telling them stories about the past so they dont go through that rough past and make the same mistakes. I agree that some people may not what to interact with other people or even care about what they want to say. I agree but if you just hear them out they might just convince you to change your mind. All I'am just trying to say if you do not like the hits or opinion they are trying to give you just back off and find someone new or just go with the flow and follow what your heart attends you to do.

1205,5D742A0E0623,"It has been said that a positive attitud is the key to success in life.

I'm agree with this statement, I'm one of the persons that think that a good attitude can open many doors to anyone.

Example: If tou are looking for job, and you are talking to the person who is going to give you the job, and you are being with a negative attitude, and being arrogant tha person is going to think more about it.

Example: If your attitude is bein positive, and you are being nice with tha person his going to be nice also, and yuo would have more posibility to get it.

A reason of why you need to be with a positive attitude, is because life is more easy by tha way your main is out of stress, but more important you would be always happy.

And my last oppinion, I defent this position because, year's ago i was with a very negative attitude and always thinks happened to me, and i alwas was like why this is hapening to, and one day i say is enough and i was about to finish with my life and i dont know what happen that from tha day i change my main, when you do think with a good attitude everything is goin to be better."
2109,9E49399B42B4,"Some people belive that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art clases. Should students be required to take a class in arts, or should such clases be electives?

I belive that students should be require to take these clases because it plays a great rolls in our lives. students should take these clases because they're part of our daily activity. Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take.

I also agree with those that says that students should be required to take clases like art, music, and drama because some students wants to become an artistic, some wants to become a musician, while the others want to be a dramatist, so it should be allowed in school for students to take them. I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances.

Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them.

Well it's true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they don't know how to let them out. Probaly through arts, music, or even drama they'll be able to express them out to the world. Through this subjects many people are rich today, and many people was able to let what had been in them for years upon years out, so they should be required for students.

For instance: Beyounce, Rehanna, Nici and so on. I believe those people didn't just come up to become rich today they study music because that was their goals in life.

In summary, music, arts, and drama should be required for students to take, and such clases shouldn't be electives in school or for students."

One Decision Can Change A Person Life!

However, some people might argue with that, because they think that people should not make their own decisions but they should seek guidance from experts to make a better decisions for them.

First, everyone should depends on himself and make a better decisions in life to get more experience for example a student can't get a good grade unless he makes a decisions to pay attention to the teacher and doing the homework.

Second, people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions for example nobody will be by your side all the time and in the hard situations to help you make a good decision and a person should not just think once but twice and think far and know what are the consequences of every decision.

Third, one decision can change everybody life and that is on of the reasons why people should depend on them self because nobody cares about you more than you. Other reason is most of the successful people they started from nothing but they made a good decisions and they became successful.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because first everyone should depends on himself in life to get more experience second people are not going to learn unless they make their own decisions third making decisions make people stronger and know what to do in a hard situation.

3137,DD474E5804C0,"Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home?

In this prompt

I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time.

Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination.

Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn't like video conferencing which can be very often. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well.

In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Student's would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job.

Some people say that school is very important for students, that they'll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won't drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month.

All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that student's can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.     "
3910,FFED00D6E0BD,"Do you think that failure is the main thing for people consist on their goal's and success without lose their enthusiasm?

I agree with the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success in life because, I think failure is the main key to people reach their goal's because they need to have the idea that after failure came the success, secondly they need to be positive and have in mind what they want and how they want to reach their success in life, and last they have to be prepared for failure, and they have to be prepared to confront the failure because they need to keep in mind that not everything is going to be in the way they want, but at the same time they always need to have in mind that everything is possible with effort.

First, people need to have the idea that after failure came the success, because everything happens for a reason and if something goes wrong for certain reason in the moment when they try to success they need to accept things, and keep trying. They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk that's something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they don't give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens.

Secondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goal's is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they don't have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make thing's happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life.

Finally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, that's something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal,

they need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they can't let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other one's success in life and they try to guide people into failure.

In conclusion, there have been nothing that can't stop people to reach their goal's and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capable's of everything and they need to learn to not give up. In that way they would be able to do everything and be successful the key is always have and excellent attitude and be prepared for people to judge, and be prepared to failure and get up and make it see like their have been nothing wrong and keep going. They need to be positive in every movement they make and be positive in the way that everything is going to be exactly how the planned."

2073,9BF2607D4878,"The statement is ""the first impression is almost impossible to change"" which is a different feeling for everybody, but for me, I disagree. In fact, the first impression is really important and sometimes true, but I think the first impression does not define a person, an object or a situation. Having a first impression is a human reflex, like having an opinion or a judgment. We are doing it unconsciously.

The first impression is most of the time not real, you need to search deeper to make an opinion and when you really have an opinion, then, the first impression is not important anymore. For example, when you meet someone, your first impression might be that you think she is supercilious and even a little bit mean. Therefore when you really get to know her deeper then you will find that she just had a bad day and that she is nice and sociable. Sometimes it's the contrary, a person seems really nice but in reality she is not, so your first impression was wrong. It is not good to stay on a first impression because most of the time it's wrong.

Moreover, the physic, behaviors or attitude can change an impression. If the person do not smile and seems to be rude but in reality is the nicest person, then it will be awkward for you because you thought she was bad. Sometimes a person can have a bad reputation because of the first impression he shows and it is not his fault, some persons just don't smile every time. Sometimes you can be disappointed because you didn't get to know the person because of your first impression.

The first impressions is not only for people but also for a situation or an object. For example if you are in a library and you want to buy a book, the first thing you are going to do is looking at the cover of the book. If it's pretty you will more easily choose this one instead of a book with a black cover and only the title, because it is your first impression. But your first impression is wrong because you didn't take time to read the resume and you will find soon that the pretty book is actually boring instead of the black book which is really interesting. An object can look nice but have a bad quality. The first impression is the color and the shape of the object, like the physic and the attitude of a person.

In conclusion I would say that the first impression is sometimes right but most of the time it's not. In my opinion, you must not keep in mind your first impression of a person, it's most of the time wrong. You have to get to know the person to build your own opinion. It is normal to have a first impression, like judging, but you must not take the habit to stick with your first impression.      "
3715,F7E091B1D163,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble?

In this essay I will discuss as to why curfews could be a necessary law for teenagers.

One of the reasons curfews could help out parents keep their children safe is that teenagers like to hangout with friends late at night and having a curfew for teenagers could prevent them from getting in some sort of trouble.

Another reason why curfews could keep teenagers more safe is teenagers think they know everything in this world but in reality they don't know how the world really is and anything can happen at any certain time.

The finale reason why I think some teenagers need to have curfews is because some teenagers are still not mature enough to be out late at night and something could possibly happen to them. I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes.

In concussion I think the 3 reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. As a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. Curfews can be good thing to keep parents aware of what their children are doing but I personally think they should not be a law for every teenager. For example some parents they are OK with letting their child to be out late at night but as long as they stay in contact with a parent at all times. That shows that not every teenager in this world is irresponsible and is aware for their own actions. "

Furtheer more, not having a great additude can lead to not accomplishing your goal or be successful as you would like in life.           "

2014,983D4402B74F,"Not everyone in the world is able to accomplish their dream. There are so many obstacles that make a dream impossible and a lot of important things to give up in order to reach it. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Winston Churchill because I also believe that failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life.

First, all the things have two sides. the bad side and the good one, not everyone can see this two sides because of two simple reason. The first reason is because they do not try hard enough to find a solution. The second reason is because they loss their hope. Failure has two side but they are hard to see. The bad side of failure is that you did not reach that goal in your first or second try and you give up everything. The good side is that you fail but you learn a little bit on the way and that the next time you will be more close to reach that lovely goal.

Second, some things that i have learn from family, friends, and own experiences is that hope is the most powerful thing in the world. Most people tempt to lose their hope when they fail, while for others that maintain it can be more able to success. When I try something and I fail I always ask a question to my self. The question is What would I be without hope? When i answer that question I feel that all my strength and enthusiasm that I need for reaching that dream come to me.

Lastly,

a person can not reach a goal without been enthusiast. No one in the world would fight for something that is not interested on. Enthusiasm is what give you the strength and hope to keep trying until you success. Enthusiasm can also be lose by a person when they fail so many times. The thing that make people lose their enthusiasm is the time.

In conclusion, in order to be a successful person in life you need to make sure not to lose the three keys. Failure, that help you to gain experience, hope that help you to not give up, and enthusiasm that help you to keep trying. This are the three keys. Next time that you fail just thing about this three keys and you will be able to success in your life."
152,0B84A2B37B65,"On my opinion, I agree what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, i agree what author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because if you try to do something with less beyond that is already master you will never grow because you still doing the same thing that is already master, you never go advance, you have to do new things and Lear new things on the way you grow doing news things. Many people do the same thing they don't do news things they have to do news things to Lear news things

If you train to do something that is already made, you loosing your time, on the time that you are loosing you can do news thing doing other things, we don't have to do the same things always.

I take my position on that and i think what the Author Waldo Emerson wrote is right about what hi wrote.

It is important to do news things because you learning news things doing differents things                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
1611,7AB87BA4342F,"Kids play to have different jobs, but I know, since I was a baby, what I want to do. The world of the entertainment, in special the theater, is something that always catch my attention, thats why I would like to visit the Art and Performance Center.

The principal reason why I want to go is for my family influences, my grandma has been dreaming about me been an actress. I remember going to the theater with her, telling me that her biggest dream is, one day, see me on one of those performances or shows. When I was littler, I use to participate on local shows every summer, her proud smile and happy tears make me feel that I was on the right place, doing the right thing. I know she would be so happy if I become an actress.

Also, the Art and Performance Center has been the place of one of my favorites presentations,""The Rose"", the feelings that the esterpians transmit during the hold act are powerful; they make you feel that you are part o the show, or even better, they make you feel that is not a show. Imagine myself on that scenario with the lights, music, the public, while I am realizing a magnificent performances is something that makes my feel really grate. I want to inspire people in the same way that actors inspires me.

My love for the performant arts isn't the unique reason why a should go, I am a respectful and courteous person; a hardworker which goal is to learn everything about arts. Some students aren't really interested on the place they go, playing around, acting boring, but not me, I am really interesting in this opportunity, in all the special details of the world of preforming arts. From the backstage to the actual scenario, everything would be a delaitful experience for me.

For all this reasons, I would like to go to the Art and Performance Center, seeing all the components and experiences that brings you the fantastic world of the theater.

3549,F1270F8362F8,"""Hip hip hooray!"". ""Thats a talented kid!"". The whole school cheering for you after you made the winning shot for your school to win the whole basketball game. Imagine the enormous crowd enjoying your performance. One talent I have is using math everyday. Some people do not use math as much as I do. I use it when I go to the store,at school,and at home. Math is one of the things I use everyday.

I use math when I am at the store because I have to calculate my money and how much I will be using. I develop this skill from school because I have use math is most my whole school career. Some individuals might think my talent is unusual,but I think that my talent is helpful in the real world. I would rather spend my life as a math expert than just staying at home and doing nothing. I want to succeed right now ,so I can become a well-educated and successful adult.

In addition,another place I use math is at school. This is the place where I developed this skill. Teachers have an excellent job making me the person I am today. For instance, I am doing my project and need to get the dynamics right I use make to help me with the project. I would like to became a math teacher at my school. Math is all around us

, but you just don't notice it.

Moreover, the last place I use math in is at my house. I use it in dividing my chores with my siblings and I use in the kitchen when I am measuring ingredients. I also use it when I do my homework. It helps me when I am playing basketball because you need an arch to make the ball straight in. It helps when I am older because I would already know how do math and know how to use in the real world.

In retrocept, there a variety of talents ,but my talent is using math everyday at home,at school,and at the store.

I use math almost everyday of my life. Math has been a huge part of my life."
2090,9CE077EDCC85,"The reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington quote . First this is a good quote for students who are always working hard and make a lot of mistakes because they get motivated from this quote. This quote can make someones day better .

First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up.

Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best.

My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is it's hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

In conclusion I think that everyone should agree with Duke Ellington's quote because it can help you not give up when you are going through a problem. "
2053,9AC32EA4050B,"Due people has to do all by they self? Sometimes is hard to do all the job with out help. Or sometimes we only want some one who can we talk to. By working alone it makes feel alone. I believe that working with a group is better because we meet new cultures, we learn how to communicate and we help each other.

We meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe. We start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. Also the food and the music from their country. Meet new persons from others country's is good so that way we start to know more about the world.

We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. We start to talk with new person's. We start to share thing's from our culture and what like to do and our free times. We start work together and getting better by communicating. Communication is important for every one.

In groups we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. Went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff: where the next class is, where the cafeteria is,

where the buses stop, etc. Also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. Be in a group also help to make work more easy because we help each other by putting ideas together. Groups are the best way to perform language speaking.

Some people might say work alone is better because is only my self no one more, but in a group is more easy way to learn with help. Know new culture's from different's parts of the world is fun. Communicate is something important for live and our society to. We give support, we get support by working in group. Interact whit people helps a lot and make work more easier."
3719,F834F75D0E3C,"The school board plans to add one and a haft hours to each school day. Do you think is a good ideas to extending the school day? The school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because all the students will got stress,all the school program will get delay, and the all starts to skipping school.

The first reason why the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day is because all the students will got stress. Some students can get depression by learning to much. They don't want to study anymore because of the long day in school. They will get very tired of sitting all day. They will not do their homework because they have to memorize a lot of thing at school are ready. They don't have a lot of time left at home to study or do in their homework. They will not interesting in school anymore. That's the first reason why the school board should not one and a half hours for each school day.

The seconds reason why the school board should not extending the school day is because of the school program and activity will got delay. So if the school board add one and a half hours of school all the after school program will get delay. No more students want to stay after anymore because if to late. Just think about the transportation from the school. If a student live in a rural area they have to wake up at 5 A.M to get ready for school because from his/her house is one hours away for the school. If the student planning to stay after school she/he may not get home at 7 P.M. And he/she have to get home before 7 P.M to be available to do her/his homework. That is all the reasons why school should not extending the school day.

The cost of electricity every year is over 6 millions dollars, just think about how much it can cost the school board if they add one and a half hours of school each day? If the school board add one and a half hours for each school day, all the students can learn more thing. The last reasons why the school should not add one and a half hours because the cost of electricity. Every years the school board have to pay over 6 millions dollars. If the school board spend over 6 millions to the electricity every years then how many millions for every thing else. The school board will not have a lot of money let to updates the school.

The school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because all the students will got stress,

the school program and activity will got delay, and the cost of electricity. That is all the reason why the school board should not add one and a half hours for each school day. Are you agree or disagree with extending the school day?            "
987,4BA9296EBE9F,"A topic that is debated is if students should do online classes. Some people believe that there should be online classes. They believe that there should be online classes because the students can take there time and feel comfortable where they are . I belive that we shouldn't have online classes because student can ask for help when they need it, Students are better when they work together as a team and you can get extra help after school and before school .

Students can ask for help. Teacher can help students when they don't understand something instead of trying to look it up on the internet .Students don't learn from the internet or they will just forget. Online classes is good but what if the students doesn't understand then they would just stay confused. The teacher can show them in person then in a computer screen. If students did online classes what if they don't understand there work because they can't just call there teacher sometimes they don't answer.

Students work better when they work together. Group projects can help them in the future when they got to work with other people. They can learn from each other and there mistakes . When the students are in groups they don't do it solo and they can get the more work done. They get to meet new people that they never ever get to talk to and make new friends. Online classes you just listen to the teacher and ask question do the same thing but can never work with other people.

There extra help after and before school. Online classes there no before or after school it just the time of your classes. In School the teacher stay after or come before school to help students with their work or the ones that just doesn't understand . The Teacher helps them with homework so they don't have to do it at home and the same with classwork if they don't get it done there after school. There also people who have to do stuff after school so there is before school where they can come early and do there workk.

I believe that we shouln't have Online classes because student can ask question,student have more fun doing group activity and if the students need help they have after and before school to get extra help.

Online classes isn't really necessary it wouldn't effect anything.

Teacher are more helpful then computer.                                         "

Those who believe, that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms,have their reasons,for example they believe that cell phones are distracted, in a way that students can't control it. They also think that cell phones are addictive. However,that is not true because we all can control our self, and i think that if we use our cell phones in a corresponding way, we will not only learn more, we will improve our skills and in the future become professional in anything.

I believe that we should used cell phones for research purpose,for example i remember when i was in English class i got sick, and i had to go to the doctor when i came back, to school the teacher was giving directions for our next assignment,but in that moment i felt like i was out a lot of days,but no it was only 2 days out of class,so i said to him I feel like i had miss a lot of thing just let me know what i need to do, and i will try to do everything that i need,so he said we went over more vocabulary, but right now i am explaining something, if you want to do it you have to stay after school i will be happy to help you. I said no you don't have to explaining me nothing, just give me the vocabulary i will look it up in internet,and i will write down the meaning of each word i will be quiet,so you can keep doing what you doing. He said fine. If cell phones are not allowed in classrooms, I could not do my vocabulary, and not only that i improved my skills by researching for good information which is not easy. I think that this is a good example why we should used cell phones in classrooms, so we can use them in a correct way thinking about our grades.

I also think that we should used cell phones for projects. This is my friend called Generic_Name he is 17 years old we are friends from middle school. In this time we were in government class, once again the teacher gave us a group activity in this case we had to came up with a new country, otherwise invent country,so we had to give it name,where it will be located, and the rulers for its country. After that,all the students got their own computers,but there were not enough for everyone,so we had no computers next,we asked the teacher can we used our cell phones,for the project she asked if there were no more computers and we said no not more,so with no choice the teacher said yes,used your cell phones,but only for the project,without wasting time we got our phones out,and we started working on our new project we worked in our cell phones as we had computers after the hard work we stopped,because the bell ring. This is another proof why cell phones are important they are really helpful in many different s ways we used all cell phones,for the whole project and thanks to that we turned in our project on time.

In conclusion,we should all used cell phones in classrooms for research purpose and projects. having in mind that a lot of people will not agree,but cell phones are helpful. They are important. technology is here for us,so we can take an advantage, and use it like it is for our own purpose. cell phones will provide a better understanding to all the students in all schools We should reflect about it, and came up with our own position. If cell phones should be allowed in classrooms,or cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms."
1279,62243789233B,"In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.

Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called

Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.

Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.

Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.

A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy."
1801,87DF9FF7104D,"Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. in the actuality the people act like robots. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. The technology is opaquing our intellect. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. "
915,46484B622DF0,"Many high schools have opportunities for students that want to run a business .However, before they run their business I need some learning experience from a manager. I wanted to reach out to you Generic_Name to talk about what my interests are . The school I attend at is Generic_school and I am 17 Years of age. I want to learn how to start my own restaurant ,

know how you manage the prices , how to run the business , and also how to manage people.

However, I work at a restaurant at the moment and I am trying to become a manager. Although, I heard you have to do a lot before you become one . I want to know how to run the prices and how to make deals because I dont have that much experience , and must know how to do that to become a manager. Furthermore, I researched your job and read the reviews your customers love your restaurant . They say it is not to expensive but not too cheap ,also they say it is worth a drive down their. Thats why I wanted to ask to if i could get some experience from you.

Moreover, I wanted to know how to actually learn how to run the entire business. For instance, if i wanted to open up my own business I want knowledge from an expert before I do. My school does not have the right experience that you have . Also, I had spoke to one of my classmates they told me that you do training classes for students that are very interested in business she applied and she told me that she got really far in her business and that she is already getting started. I wanted to apply for the training so I have a clue on what is going on so I can eventually start my own restaurant.

Lastly, I wanted to know how to manage people around , know how to be a right trainer for a perfect restaurant. Nevertheless, people say it is hard opening up a business if you dont have the right training . For example, I had a friend that decided to run a business without experience she did not know how to mange the line in the kitchen , the people in the front, nor the prices. Later on the business ran out of service and got shut down. However, that is not how I want to end my career . I want to go somewhere and be in a place where people will love to socialize with the waiters, and to get their orders right .Thats an important part on why I came today to experience the way of training.

Based on this talk, I want to start my own business and work on becoming a better trainer . Even though, I have no experience with running my own business, managing the people, and how to manage the prices . I hope by the end of today I can get applied and start my training so I can get some ideas on how to do things around a restaurant and start my own business by 18 years of age.          "
2690,C65AD37C8194,"Desagree,To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment

To be yourself in this world is kind of difficult, but if you try really hard you will success with honor,respect,humble and make you strong. Not trying after you lose make people weakness, fearful and incapable.

If you want to success in life and future, just help others when they need it, and be humble with those people who do not have anything in life and they have to sleep in the street. Nobody is more than others, God make us equal. Be yourself every where you go, you do not have to change your personality because other people do not likes you. You have to prove yourself that you can do it, no matter how many time you fell down, just stand up clean yourself and continue. You will found a lot of obstacle in life and all you have to do is play like you are on the soccer field.

You have to be strong and prepare for what's coming in life and do not worry if others tell you that you are useless, just show it to them that you can do it. Sometimes people just left and give up. Not trying after you lose make you weakness person. Weakness person are those who give up in the first try, they are incapable to fight for what they want in life, and don't let no one change your personality, if they really love you,they would love you like the way you are. My mom always told me,""do not give up till you are in the top"",after all the struggles you will be a better person.

Nobody can change yourself, you are the only one who can dicide what you really want to be in life. You make your own rules, but you have to respect others, I will give you a counsel, If people treat you worthless do not treat them like the way they treats you,be original and treat them like royalty, after that, they will see that who lose gold was them,not you. Do not let no one hurt you because we are in a world where no one wants to see any body get victory. All I can say is be yourself, if you want to dye your hair blue and you are afraid what people opinions are, just do it, do not start walk around to find your happiness because your happiness are inside. I hate it when people said like what happen if I do not looks pretty, you are pretty inside and outside, do not make yourself miserable.

The struggles will make you strong and get all you want in life, like David and Goliath, ""the little boy who fight with the giant warrior and he won, when he throw the rock into his eyes"", no matter how big is the problem and how small you are, you have to fight with your fear. If you pray to God and tell him what is going on in your life, he will helps you to solve it, like he solve David's battle. Do not let people change the way you are, because some people just come and goes through and we have to enjoy what we got while we have it and do all the things that we haven't, and thanks God because we are here.

Conclusion,

Live the life you love and love the life you live, just do what makes you happy. Remember that your happiness are inside, all you have to do is look for it and find something that you can prove yourself , that you made it without help and make yourself feel proud and do not let people take advantage of your insecurity because you are great, you are strong and that is all you have to do, focused on your success."
551,2A2AE5FB899F,"One topic that is frequently debated today is, if the amount of work days should change to less then five days to four with the idea of conserve energy and resources. Many people think the school should reduce the day of school. Some people believe that is a good idea to conserve this value and important resources. I think this idea will not make a good change because many student will be affected with this idea they work after school, we will have less time to do wherever we want, and it is difficult to everybody to stay focus ten hours in the school.

To being,

just imagine all the students how work after school, everyone have a limit in our body's and mind's to do different activities every single day. If for the students how they don't work after school it is really difficult to stay on time with they homework, think about the student's that only get home and just change their cloths, maybe eat something at home or just wait for a break in the work. A lot of students have to pay their own food, clothes, and even a lot of them pay rent. If the school finish at six, they will have less time to make money to live, that is one of the big situations that a lot of teenagers live every day. Now think about the increment of the time in the school and all the effects that will have.

Therefore, our second reason is we will have less time to do wherever we want or wherever we need to do. If the school finish at six only in one hour or more, the night come out. If you want to play soccer on the grass you can't because is to dark, a lot of stores close early, if you want to buy something you couldn't because probably the stores are closed at that time. when we got home our parents probably are not even there, many of them have to work on night. we only will have four hour's to do at less something that we want to do or we need to do starting from six to teen with the idea of that is the time to go to sleep.

However, it is difficult to stay focus ten hours in the school. More time in the school, more time of homework or even more classes to take. We will have even less time to do any activity after school, because we will not have enough time to finish our work. With all the material that we have to finish we being to stress out and not doing good in the school.

In conclusion, the amount of day at school is not necessary to change to less them five days and steel the same time, everyone get tired and sometime everyone only need a rest to continue day by day. We can fiend better ways to conserves this values resources, reduce the time of work and school will not make a big change. what about all the companies that only want to make money and they don't even care about the resources in our planet just keep doing money and destruction. sleep well if one of the most important needs of our body. If we have less time in the afternoon to do ,what we need to do we will not go to sleep early. We can't follow the same routine every single day, after school we can: play soccer, go to shopping, go to the movies. A lot of different activities that we can do, like one famous quote say "" It is more time,then life "" . We could do better with more time on our hands.               "
1716,822F6C3B3C03,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do.

One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then you're never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot.

Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but you're in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isn't going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because you're doing something for your own good.

Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say i'm tired then you're never going to do anything, you're just giving up on yourself.

For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things you'll end up liking it. If you're an active person you'll accomplish way more than expected because you're going to be moving around and getting out you're comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because you're talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because you're going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more.

I strongly do believe that if you're doing something that you put your mind to, then you're always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say you're going to do something you'll never do it because you're just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions. To be able to do something you have to get up from the couch and do it without having to think so hard about it.         "
2324,ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people."
718,374CF6E834A5,"Year-round schools have more break over the year, you may have more break during the year but you will have less vacation time over the summer, it's going to shows that year-round schools has more stress, less vacation time and less money make over the summer.

The first issue about year-round schools is more stress, the main thing students stress about is what clothes should they wear to school everyday it makes students to buy more clothes even when they have a lot of clothes because some students want to look better than everyone else in school by not wearing the same clothes everyday to school. students are not the only people who stress teachers will stress about what lesson should they teach and they will a lot assignment to grade.

The second issue about year-round schools is less vacation time, students will have 3 to 4 week vacation over the summer so student won't have as much vacation time as they would like to have because 3 to 4 week vacation is not a lot of time for student to go to another country for long time. parents will be affected by this too because some responsible parents can't leave their kids and go to another country alone.

The third issue about year-round schools is less money make, student can't work over the summer because they don't have the time, one month is not a long period of time to work you can still make some money but you can's make as much money as you could make in 3 months not only the students would make less money government will too they would buy for the electricity and water and other stuff.

Some may say you will have more breaks over the year, but you will not have as much vacation time over the summer.

Some other may say you will not forget anything you learned if you have short break time, but learning everyday without any long breaks will make you a lot of stress."
140,0AD69388300B,"One topic that is frequently debated today is whether students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some people taking classes from home is more helpful. They feel like they have more time to do extra activities throughout the day. I believe that going to school is better because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities.

First reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to experience the real world. When you go to school you have to wake up early to get ready and make it on time to school, in the other hand when you are home schooled you get to wake up at whatever time and still do your work, that is not experiencing the real world because life it is not always going to be like that. School makes you experience the real world by so many ways. When you are at school you work in groups with other people and that is getting you ready for when you grow up and have to work with other people at your job.

Second reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to make friends. When going to school you get to interact with people and make new friends, in the other hand when you are at home you do not interact with anyone it is only you by yourself. Having friends is really good, they can help with what they can. At school you can ask your friends for help in a subject when you do not understand something.

Third reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to enjoy all the school activities. School activities are one of the favorite things about school that students like. If you are home schooled you do not get to enjoy them and have fun with your friends. When going to school you get to enjoy senior night, school dances, and extra curricular activies, which are super fun.

As you have read, I believe that going to school is better than taking your classes from home because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities. School teaches you most of the things that you know and need in life at the end of the day. On that day we are going to realize on why we need school so much.                           "
1097,54304ACFE477,"when we're born we come out of our mothers womb, the first thing we naturally do is screech and cry, and if we dont cry the doctor hits us on our backs and try's to make us cry. And from that cry on we develop our own kind of sound and our own screech with its own pitch. They take our fingerprints where there will never be two of the same, even when were born with our twin it will never be the same no matter how much alike we are. from there on we start to learn and develop our own persona. After were born our brain starts to function even with little stuff, babies learn to cry when they're hungry, want to be changed, when theyre in pain or simply want attention. When children get older into the toddler stage they start to learn how to walk by observing everyone else they learn to talk by listening to everyone else around them. We learn how to grab our bottle, pick up a fork or spoon, and practically our own daily doings. But we learn all that from observing and listening to everyone else. When we hit our 6-12 years of age where we have a tendency that we want to fit in be in the cool kids group and we watch TV see celebrity's see that there are musicians, actors, painters, policeman, firemen, dentist, doctors, mayors chefs, soccer players, basketball players, football players, baseball players, hockey players, tennis players, volleyball players etc the list could go on and on, but the point here is the fact that we influences. But as we get older in our teen years 13-19 we start to have our own kind of voice at least until were old enough to make them, we all take our own paths and we choose to make the decisions that we make, our parents dont go with us throughout the day telling us what to do or not do making our each and every decision for us, they sure do give us a hell of advice because they already went threw that stage and they dont want to see fail and get hurt but sometimes its good that we fail and make mistakes because then we learn what we can or cannot do. Now as you turn into an adult that net that we used to have when we were living under mom and dads roof is no longer there its gone we dont have that privilege anymore, and we need to grow up and create and develop our own persona officially. when you get a job it comes with responsibilities and from there we learn if were responsible or irresponsible, if were social or non social if were lenient of non lenient, patient or impatient, forgiving or unforgiving. Id like to think that were all born to grow and learn about our rugged society, and based on what we've lived is how were going to act because we can literally live in a shit hole of a place and have the happiest attitude ever and have a better attitude then a boy or girl complaining that she didnt get the car she wanted, verses the kid that saw his mother get beat by his dead beat dad or the kid that was up all night wondering if his mom was going to come home tonight or even the kid that went to sleep hungry. So honestly i don't think that were born with labels i feel like we all can make our own decisions of what were going to make of life, if you'r going to sit there and make everyone see you as a pity. A huge play of your character is your mentality is you have a broken done weak mindset your going to have negative vibes and weak dead beat character, but if you have a strong mindset and the will to get stuff done then youll have a broad and respected character. In conclusion id like to think that we create and build our own character and and that were not given a label by any higher power of what our character is going to be in life."
3599,F2CB99D1FE9F,"Dear Generic_Name, in our school is common to see many students working in groups. I would like to tell you that by working in group I can get a lot of benefits. For example, getting a good grade,

having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone.

I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but that's one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. I also like to hear peoples' ideas and stories. For example, I like to hear peoples' stories about their life and childhood.

I personally like to get good grades on school projects. I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. I will learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didn't try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it.

Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. But I think they are wrong. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade.

When I work in group there's a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice. Because I have experience how good it feels to work in groups.

1841,8A9E12ADD91C,"Should the aouthor Ralph Waldo Emerson, is righ what he was wrote.?

If you already learn something new and you want to tray again make sure to try and make little of different because is not really good idea alway making the same thing in your life.

Alway keeping ahead and don't look back to the passed. Mr Ralph waldo Emrson, is traing to explain to us what is good to make. If you already was mastered we can not just put only that when we can learn something new in our life.

First of all,it is important to remember what you already learn, but is not just alway traing to make only the same thing that you ready was mastered belond and yu want to make againg. I agree what Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson just said. It is really good when you are thinking and just thinking tomaking somting new thing then you will be product for your future. We getting to remember makin a new thing is alway important. Also you will get to open your brain assun u look and go ahead.

Secondly, I am disagree to try the same thing that you already get learned in the passed in your life. whatever you already learned don't have to reapead again and again only that.

Because you is not learning new thing you will not get progreesiible for you future when you going grow up. If you already was mastered don't has to go at the passed and only wrote alway the same thing in your present.

In conclution, It is important keeping at from and don't only try to make something beyend that you already get done .Is good use what you having ready learned, but you should go and trying new thing. Acording to Mr, ralph Waldo Emerson wrote . You will never grow up if you try to making only the sme thing beyond that you just got ready leaned. whatever you just got leaned don't mean that you only have to wrote only that. when you can lean show and making new thing .

930,473FF163E44A,"_Yes i think yes its can by a benefit to attend classes from home because many students come late in the school and the teachers sometimes they mark they students are absents or late, but may the school can give the opportunity to who work or to who need it because many student we are working in at the night and sometimes we see many of they students sleep in classes.

_But if we attend classes from home that will by better because we will sleep more time at home and we will don't come at the school every day or wake up the same time all day, but the teachers will by attent for their students who has take their classes from home to send their work or to help they students when they don't understand or sometimes we stock to do or how to do and then the teachers will by help.

_But is a bad idea to because many students are may don't wants to doing all they work at home because they knowing they are home and when we are home we prefer doing others things except the school work and that can by a problem when we take the test because many students can fail their test, because in home we can find the answers in internet or anywhere but when we are in the school every day we can't use our phone or anything to find the answers because the teachers wants to test us what are we know or what we are need to know to by better and to resolve all you'r work in you'r own idea may the teaher can give you some ideas or examples or explain how you can do it but is diferent like when you finding the answer in internet because the internet can give you all the answer and yuo will be no learn nothing because it's just copy what are you see except with the teachers you learn more because they tell to you to try to do it in your own and you have an idea to what are you going to do.

_And it can by hard for the students to graduate because can affect they attend in the school and will many students going to skiping because they can come in the school but they can leave early because they can find a excuse to to leave and to do the attendece at home or just skiping classes and don't doing nothing. Well it okay to come in the school every day because if one has attend in home then all students wasts to have attend at home "
2363,AF98232BDB08,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldn't use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldn't be doing and that won't help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldn't use their cell phones in class is that they aren't learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and won't be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they don't do well on because they haven't been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they can't do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students don't need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they don't need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they won't need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they won't be doing their work they will be doing other things that aren't importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldn't be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldn't be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school."
102,07A4DAFDE5B7,"Hello, Mr: Principal.

I'm writing to you this letter to inform you about our responses about changing the school manu.

I'm a senior student in your high school. I really want to thank you about approving the idea of chenging the school manu to a new healthier and bigger one. We really appreciate that.

Some of us have a bad experince about the unhealthy food and the schol old manu.

one of them is PROPER_NAME he hate the spicy food and once before he tried it by mistake from the cafeteria, his stomach hurt him and he was throwing up all the day, and all of that because of the un healthy food.

And also I will tell you sir about my own experince, I still remember, when I was a kid I had one of the worst days on my entire life in the middle school when I decided to eat the new spicy wings with the super hot souce, I went to the hospital and I was very sick for a long time in the home.

And all of that because of the unhealthy food such as what our school used to have.

Do you know sir, I used to feel unacceptable in the school, just because the food, just because I can not eat like the rest of the students. and I can not enjoy the food with them.

I have never tried the school food since that day. the only case I could eat the school food is when the cafeteria have some kinds of soap, and some kind of the none spaicy food. And there is a lot of students have the same case of me, we all are sharing our healthy lunch together, you might before have seen us in the cafeteria while we are setting as a circle.

But by your decision, there are more than a hundred of student will turn back to eat in the school cafeteria.

We all will be enjoying the new cafeteria manu.

Especially because I heard that will be a different types of milk and different type chicken and also I heard from the new chef that you brought him from one of the biggest holtes in Virginia, he told me we will have a few types of salmon fish and others fish types.

In my opinion changing the school cafeteria manu was great idea to begin to keep your student health safe, especially your freshman and salphamore students.

I know what i'm telling you about the salphamore and the freshmens student very well, because I have my youngest brother his name is Generic_Name, he is addicted to the unhealthy food with the all of this food types, like the fast food. he could eat only the fast food in his life and he would be happy, but his body would not like that. Acctually his body begun to hurt him from now, because he been so fat and he could not move or do ant effort. he eats only the fast food which is the only unhealthy food in the world. he has a problems in his body, his body hurt him because he does not eat a vegetables and he does not has ant vetimans in his body, his body is fery big but is's very weak.and that is what the un healthy food does in our boodies. that is what you sir, saved us from and saved the next students from it. absotutly the healthy food a lot cheper than the unhealthy food. also one of the good thing is the teacher also would like to eat and try the new healthy food.

one of the good thing and actually it's the best thing ever is that healthy food will give the student more power than the un healthy food, and also the healthy food will make them paying more attention to the classes and to what the teachers are saying.

the new healthy food will be very good thing. I wish if you sir would took this decision 3 years ago, just whaen I was a freshman or when I was a salphamore that would be great if that happend. I can not stop Imagine if that happen I was going to be playing Gym all the summer and in the winter I'm was going to have PE class. That was going to be very good. I wish if that happend before.

But htat's fine I still can enjoy the rest of this year with eating a just healthy food from our cafeteria from this new chef. I heard he will add a new typers of food from other countries like France and Egypt and Spain, and Ethiopia also. yeah that is how the school lunch should be like.

Do you know Mr: principle that there are about 20 Muslim student in this school who does not eat the old manu food like the bacon and Pig.

Do you know Mr: Principal, in our school there are about 50 student or more than that who are vegan, this students used to feel very bad about the old school manu because they could ot eat any food from the cafeteria for all the time they had in the school. But from now and over these students are very happy about your decision. and also the Muslims students now they are happy because they can eat the vegan food and a least they can eat the chicken and the others food.

Actually I know there are a lot of student will arguement with you about your decision. but they still young to understand that, they still too young to look for thier health and the healthy food and the unhealthy food.

But, acctualy they will appreciate that very well when they became adults.

Mr: the principale thank you, thank you about looking for our health. thank you for being acceptable for the new ideas."

3169,DEDD5C568B4C,"I agree with being honest at all times because you need to be honest with your true friends, you need to be honest with your family, and you to be honest with yourself.

The first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them.

Your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .You got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. For example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call 911 because you are being chased. The police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. You see, friends care about you and for your safety as well.

Your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them.

Your friends just want to hangout with you have fun .

The second reason you need to be honest is with your family . You got to be honest with your family because you got to tell them the truth of what is going on in your life. What happens if your Mom or Dad are calling you while you are walking to school with your ringer cut off. They just checking on you and for your safety. Your does not want you tell them lies cause sometimes kids do not want to tell their parents what is going on in school. You never know when they are getting bullied and being harassed.

The lesson of the story is that always be honest and tell the truth with your family.

The third reason you need to be honest is with yourself at all times. You have to trust yourself because you never know what is going to happen to you. For Example, someone is selling drugs in school and he told you that you want some drugs . You have to think is this going to kill me or just say no. In my opinion I would say no to person who is selling the drugs. This actually can happen in real life . If you were in that position just say no or make an excuse . The lesson of the story is always be honest to yourself. "
3805,FB687C2C7D4B,"If you could go anywhere in the where in the world where would you go? If I was ever given the chance to visit anywhere in the world, I would choose to go visit Europe. Ever since I was a little girl I have dreamed about going to Europe and exploring it. All the articles and social media posts I have seen or read about this place make it seem as though it is the greatest place on Earth. If I ever get the opportunity to visit any place on Earth I would I would decently choose Europe. I would love to experience their culture and try new things while there. I would also go sight seeing and exploring every second I could.

The first thing I would do in Europe is try out European food. I would go to a small town or city and ask the locals where their favorite place to eat is and what it is that they like to order there. After eating I would go around the town I was in and talk to the locals about what it's like to live in a place like Europe. Another thing I would like to do while there is try out their fashion. I would go to different designers and ask them about the difference in the fashion from Europe to the one in the United States is. Lastly, since it is a special trip I would treat myself to a shopping spree.

The most important thing I would be doing while there, is going sight seeing to famous places. Firstly, I would go visit the notorious Mona Lisa I have been dying to see in real life. Secondly, I would go on a walk to visit the Eiffel Tower. While there I will take cute pictures to post on social media for memories. Lastly, I would visit a bunch of art museums and look at paintings sculptures for hours on end.

In conclusion, If could visit any place in the world I would visit Europe. Everything about this place is astonishing and I would one day like to enjoy that myself. Coming from a small city named Covington, it would be a huge change in scenery for me. I would love to experience their culture and try new things there while visiting. I would also like to go sight seeing and exploring every second I have a chance. Going to Europe will always be number one on my bucket list, so hopefully one day I can cross it off."
2233,A72A4397F9F5,"Does the success consist of going through failure?

Yes, I am agree with this quote.

As we all know been successful is not easy. Some people say that hard things make hard soldiers; Therefore, failure is part of the success, but that does not make it easy for us; Why? Because no one likes the idea of suffer in order to be successful in life. As a matter of facts; Failure help us to become who we really want to be or who we are suppose to be, but no all of us get the chance to feel successful or not even see any progress; yet some people choose to give up, instead of fight for a better life; A life with success. But do we loss enthusiasm during our way to success? yes we do!

It is OK to loss enthusiasm in our way to success; that is showing every body else, and you as well that we are humans, and we can get tire sometimes; But what is not OK is to give up, because you will showing everybody that you are weak.

By showing us how difficult life can get, and tough us that you are the only one who choose to continue or to give up in your life; Oprah Winfred would be a great overcoming example. Oprah had suffer a lot since she was a child; yet she decided to continue with her life. Even though it was not easy to act like nothing happened, but she knew what king of person she wanted to be. Therefore, she decided to fight for those things she always wanted; instead of been crying all her life. Do not doubt that the sky is the limit even for the suffering. Oprah was a determinate woman; a woman who wanted to be successful. Yet everybody else was saying that she would not be able to accomplish what she wanted; instead of supporting her they were feeling sorry for her, and not doing anything. Therefore, she became more stronger than she had ever been, and now she is showing as that even after everything she has been through you can smile with placer and success.

On the other hand we have immigrants; those people who fight day by day to get no even what they want, but what they need. As an immigrant; success is the biggest word we all are working to accomplish, some people do not even believe they can accomplish more than what they have accomplished already; Even though everything we have accomplished until this day is because of failure; because each morning we decided to go out a fight to get something else than just failure. Eugenio Dervez is an example of overcoming in a different country, language, and culture. He is an inspire person for immigrant people in the USA. Eugenio has been proving us that dreams can come true. He showed us that everything is possible, you just need to believe in yourself, and trust that you are capable of so much more. Even though some people could be selfish even in your own family; Instead of been worry about others opinion worry about your future; so one day you can be successful, too.

Finally, in my experience I have fail so many times; but I am sure that any of those times I have fail will not stop me from what I want to do or who I want to be. Somehow my family does not have faith in me; and even though that if I fail I have no one to support me; I am afraid. However I know that I am capable of so much more, and I will fight until the end of this. Also, I always wanted to show everyone that they were wrong about me that I am capable as everyone else. Yet everybody was judging me, I decided to teach myself how do become a better version of me. I will continue fighting for myself. As you should do!

In conclusion, in order to success we have to go from failure to failure. As I was said before; there are so many people that have been showing us that everything is possible. Instead of been afraid for our mistakes we need to learn from them, so we can success in our life. Therefore, we have to think about the future that we want and start working on it, so we can be the people we want to be; the people our parents want us to be. By fighting this battles day by day we are not just creating a better country for ourselves, but a better country for our families. Remember that hard battles make hard soldiers.                                                                                                              "
1193,5C72AB0B1232,"What's a career? a career is an occupation or a profession that someone do. People can start their career at any time in life. It's a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because career would prepare students for what they want to become in the future, and it can help students learn more skills and experience when they work with others.

Firstly, career can prepare students for what they want to become in the future. Consider someone who wants to become a doctor. People who want to become doctors usually work at the hospital so they can watch how doctors do their work. For example, Generic_Name was a student at Generic_school and he wanted to become a doctor one day. Generic_Name started to work at the hospital after his parents told him that they didn't have money to put him in college. Generic_Name learned a lot of of things about doctors before he went to college; and when he went to college, it wasn't so hard for him because most things about doctors seemed familiar. Generic_Name graduated with a bachelor's degree and he became a good doctor. This proves that committing to a career at a young age can be helpful in the future.

Secondly, Career can help students learn more skills and have more experience of things in life. for example, Generic_Name loves when someone plays guitar and he always say that he wish he knew how to play guitar. Generic_Name was hired after he applied on a part time job which was called "" Teen fun time"". it was a good job for Generic_Name because they could teach him many different things including guitar. Generic_Name was taught how to play guitar by some guy who liked how Generic_Name was a hard worker and nice to everyone. After hard months of training, Generic_Name could play guitar by himself. people loved how Generic_Name played guitar, therefore, his manager made him play at the entrance of the building so people can enjoy while entering the building. Generic_Name was able to draw, paint, and cook after he worked at the Teen fun time for a while. Teen fun time made Generic_Name a good guitar player and a great cooker.

Some people may say that it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because some teenagers turn into disrespectful children to their parents when they receive their first checks. For example, Generic_Name was hired at the boys and girls club. After he received his first check, he could not do anything his parents ask him to do and he would claim that he's going to be late to work. His parents did not like it and it made them unhappy sometimes. However, committing to a career at a young age is good because it teaches teenagers a lot of stuffs they need to know in life. Teenagers also make money from a career, which means that they can help their parents with small needs like buying clothes for themselves and shoes.

In conclusion, a career at a young age prepares students for their future career. If someone want to become a pilot, they have to work at the airport so they can get some ideas on how planes fly. Committing to a career at a young age can help students learn more skills and have more experience on things in life. By working with people, students can learn new stuffs from people they don't know. This proves that committing to a career at young age is good for students."
3643,F531D21A72F6,"The success is achieve something, is like a goal that we want reach. Nobody is perfect in this life, at contrary all the people make mistakes. For example: When I try to cook something to eat, sometimes I forgot to add an ingredient. As a result of this mistake the food obtain a different flavor, but of this failure I can learn and upgrade my skills like a chef.

Another example could be: when a student fail in a test, but has the chance to take a retake, is there when the student spend all their time studying to get a better grade. Daily the people commit diverse mistakes, but depend of us to determine if this mistakes will define us. Also we can take with enthusiasm this kind of failures and learn from them. Don't give up, we have to be strong. That a mistake don't stop you of achieve your goals. A characteristic of the humans is that we try to overcome all the challenges that we have in our life.

The failures teach us how to be a best person. The people just have to be more optimistics and see the failures from a good point of view. If you are negative with a failure or mistake, let me tell you that maybe you will loss the battle with yourself. If you are negative, is very probably that you will start to have bad thoughts about yourself. If you are negative, you never will be happy again, because you will stay thinking in the failure you had. I'm telling you all this, because I had this kind of problems previously.

In conclusion, don't let to the failures defeat you. You have to be strong and learn of them, to be a best person in the future. Or you want stay in the same place, with the same problems forever? No, right? You have to figth to overcome all the challenges that will appear in your life, and remember never give up. Let me tell you something else, I don't know a lot of english and I'm taking this test that have to be in english. I'm bringing all of me to get a good grade, what I mean with this. Well, even if I don't have a good grade, I learn many things that will help me in the future. I will not let the failure defeat me again, I will return more strong and with more knowledge."
3779,FA568C27F0F5,"The some businesses adopted work for ten hours for a week that will good for the worked, because they make more money for example they are working 10 hours a day they are consisting going to work but the school dont follow this model, because the student dont are coming to school everyday.,

The school dont follow this model from the businesses work. First the student are not coming to school everyday and they need to come for learn because the businesses for work are taking all the time, and just came to school for two day and they are missing all they work from the school. Also the student need to came to school for learn and be a good person and them they can work after school.

Ruler the school dont want the student just came for two day. Because one of disadvantages is they are not going to make a great grade . Second because the students are not coming school, and they dont know what the teachers are began doing during class with the other student and they will have a bad grade for not coming and dont doing the work for the classes.

One of benefits they have began work is making money. Because they are working, four-day for a week so that make they have a good time to work and make ten hours a day but they are just going to work and not come to school. Another way they can work is after school that help they to came to school and learn, have a good grades and all the classes. Next they will be respect to the teachers and do all the homeworks pay attencion in class when the techaers are teaching.

Conclusion: the school and the teachers want all the students can graduates and be a good person have a good job and they want to help every students to have a good future, and the student need to come to school everyday so that how we can learn, and student can work after school..

On my second day at work my boss told me to go help the other workers and i did and i grab the big marble table and put it on the truck and tied the rope and rap tightly so it won't fell down but when i was going to jump out of the truck and rope was ripping apart and the table got broke in half the consequently that means we clean the mess and throw it away and grab another marble to cut it in a right shape and size and delivered and fast as we can to make it one time and that is one of my scary experiences because i was scared that my boss will get mad at me and the other workers it a good thing that we work together to finished the job and the mistake we had to fix. And boss tell my dad that he did a good job and impression like his dad use to do my Father was very proud that did very well at work for the past 3 days because i work there for 5 hours and very fun and a good experience and they teach me out to use the tool the right way and how to use it properly and those people help me a lot and a pleasure to work there on the marble shop as a worker and made few new friends an that job."
2801,CCB13E22A439,"Technology allows to the people, technology they has positive or negative effects on people's lives. First, technology is a systematic treatment of application of Knowles esp. Second, technology is very important for some people because some need for job, communicates, homework, play online or other things. Third, some people uses the technology for good things like "" people can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person."" This explains the technology is good and promote more easy lives of the people. Also, the technology sometimes can had negatives effects on people's lives because some people do ban things with technology for examples, cyber bullying, steal ID form other person, or to trick the young person. Finally, technology is good for communicates with other people that lives far away or other country.

Furthermore technology had good benefit for the people life and essential for young person, but no all people usable good for example, the young uses sometime only for play game or post ban things in social minded. So technology can be has positive effects on people's live, if the people can be use right the technology. Also technology had negative effects on people's lives, if the people used technology for ban things. Sometime technology can be effects people because when the other people used social minded for make bullying to other person, this person can be effects emotionally.

In the past does not have technology; so was hard for communicates with other people, buy things from other country, or for to looking things for homework. Now is more easy to do things like; pay in online, reading book, communicates or other things now can do. My Mom and my Dad say "" in the past was hard to communicates because did't have technology (telephone,table,or computer) so before use letter to communicate with other person, but to take long time. Now is more easy to communicate because the people have cellphone.

Now the time chances because technology increase more better and more easy to do things. technology increase each years because put new cellphone computer or other things like that. Now the company have good money because all people have cellphone or computer and the cellphone year to year they more expensive to buy. In conclusion, technology has positive and negative effects on people's lives."
3414,EA857E7CEFD9,"I disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring.

One reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. For example if Generic_Name has soccer practice anymore. Another example is if Generic_Name hosts computer club she cant host it because there is no time for hosting her club. Another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school.

The second reason the school board should not add one hour and a half is because your going to have to give the teachers more money for the extra hours. An example is that if there child is sick and they need to pick them up but they cant because they are teaching. Another example is if Generic_Name is the boss of the school board and the extra one hour and a half she is going to have to do extra work so she make sure that everyone gets there pay check. Another example is teachers are going to have to make sure they have enough work for the extra time and plus they have to grade all of the work the students do. The last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything.

Another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students. Another example is if half of the students are sleeping and tiered there is no point of teaching them because they are likely not going to do work or forget everything they learned that day. Another example is that the teachers will be angry from all the students with their heads down because they are tiered. Another example is that students and teachers have family and places to be. Another reason there shouldnt be one hour and a half is that everyone has their schedules like for example shower,homework,eat,sleep and they wont have time to do all of their schedule

This is why i disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring."
3409,EA37D9C12C91,"life is to much fun and joy and happines we just need to know how to organize it to make it easer, so we can be better as we can.

I do agree with Emirson's statement because before we do something we have to finish what we have in our hand, so we can go to next step, like we can't go to next flore without going into stairs.

to be better person as you can you have to be orzanize your stuff, so you can make it perfect because you have enough time to do what you got in your hand and before you start your day you should know what to do before you go out from bed.

without organize you will see everything hard and impossible to finish, like in school when you have all work from all other classes and you see them all facing your eyes, you will do not doing any homework.

To make life easer with happines you better organize it and make your life better as you can, or you will never grow up."
750,39B6454376C8,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm writing this letter to you because i think that is better to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all because they might get distract when they have their cell phones and they might use them during class. I think this is better because some students bring cell phones to school and they use them during class and they don't pay attention to the teacher and they are always distract when they have cell phones, some students don't pay attention because they are using cell phones in class and when the teacher ask them a question they don't know what to answer because they didn't pay attention when the teacher was talking. Another thing is that some students are now getting in trouble because they are using cell phones talking to other people that they don't really know and they give that person information about them and about school and they don't really know who that person is and they could be in danger because that person knows everything about them and about the school.

Sometimes students have their cell phones turn on during class and when the teacher is talking the phone begins to sound like someone calling or a message and they interrupted the teacher and the teacher have to take time from the lesson and tell the student to turn on the cell phone or to give it to her.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME."
1126,579603CA894B,"Why is it important to learn from the experience of others? Well it could help you in the future to make a decision or to pick in between stuff.

I think it's really interesting to hear about other people back experiences. In overall if someone is trying to talk to you about their past experiences you should pay close attention because it could come handy in life.

One of the reasons why it's important to learn about other's past experiences is because it could help you out in the future. For example if you encounter the same situation as them you'll know what to do,in the other hand if you didn't pay attention to them and you face the same situation they did you'll be clueless on what to do. If a friend is in trouble or he needs advice with something you could help them out because of other's past experiences.

Another reason why it could be important to listen to someone's past experiences is so you don't make the same mistakes as them. When I was 8 years old my grandpa used to tell me that smoking wasn't good at all even tho he did it all the time,then my dad told me the same thing about smoking so I'll always know that smoking it's not good for anyone's health and I won't make the same mistake my grandpa did.

In conclusion I think that listening to other people's past experiences is good because it will help a lot in the future and it'll help you make important decisions in life and you could even help other people when they are struggling."
2170,A21A69767BEE,"So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Let's to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills!

What do to improved our talking/people skills, it's important to get feedback from others and you don't even know when you need it of not. Like here's an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and does'nt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and it's always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But it's hard when you are nervous.

How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why I'm telling you this it's because I don't want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more.

Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future.

Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that it's important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think it's better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world."
2411,B32F41984B27,"Here is my three reason why student should not go online do the classes work at home.

My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home.

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you don't know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home.

My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.

Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did.

my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.

Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid.

My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.

I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home.

summer:

Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B."
3669,F610C7BCD9EC,"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn't attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home.

Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think it's much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment.

One reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because it's difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didn't pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. It's undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade.

Another reason of why students shouldn't attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasn't like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didn't see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he won't come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I can't say if it's a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn't like to talk.

In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldn't attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life. "
2564,BE928441C9D6,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe Churchill about what he said ''success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm ''

sometimes in life you have to be a failure to be successful. For example , I know friend of mind when he first came to the USA he didn't even try to speak English.

After a while the time came and he had to learn and try when he tried he filed and filed couples times in till he be came a successful . me in person filed couples times in all SOLS

but I had fix and I kept trying and trying in till pass all of them. at the same time it might be a bad thing because some of us when they fail they give up so easy.

I sagest we should teach student about what that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.                                                                                             "
3827,FC86782120D3,"I would do better thing that will push me ahead so I can do better in school and outside of school . I would make a list of thing that I have to do so I

. and everyone that want to do they can sing up for it .

People would like this one thing that everyone is doing so they can make u work more hard and have a good personal plan and if they want they can be anything in the world and make a good choose in there live when they move on and they can teach the little kids that want to have a good lifestyle. and everyone can say they all made a good path in there life when they have something to doing there life and they can life a better life and have a good House and have a good job .and finally .

3339,E73CF852AC12,"Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. Most of the time older people or somebody you don't really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up.

Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them.

Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day.

There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal.

In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. Giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want. It is not going to be easy to always have a positive mind but,if the person really wants that then it will give all it's effort."
1146,58EF6CAF956B,"Do you want to know the reason why it is important to have someone who can share wisdom and experience with you? Well, I know there are a lot of reason. The benefit of having someone who shared wisdom and experience with you is that, people will show new things, you will get an opportunity to learn new things, and you won't feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this.

When my friend shared how she overcome being alone, because she couldn't speak English well, I realize that I can overcome being alone too. It was hard for me to talk with the other kids, because I was afraid that they will laugh at me, because I couldn't speak well, and then my friend says ""try to talk with them, otherwise you won't be able to speak with them,"". After that, she told me If I want to communicate, I need to be confident. Like that, She shared her experience.

The another benefit is that you can learn new things from the person who shared their wisdom to you. When they tell you about their experience, you will gain strength from it and you won't be afraid to do new things. When the people who tell you about their experience see you doing new things, they will support you, so that your experience will be memorable.

There are times when you feel like you are the only one who is experiencing this, but when someone tells you about their story, you will feel that you are not the only one who is feeling like this. When they shared their story, you will gain an opportunity to make new friend. You two will share your feeling about the experience and become closer. On the other hand, the funny and the sad stories will make you two have fun while you talk.

Since you know that there are a lot of reasons to share your experience, I wish you could use them to share your wisdom in the future. Don't you think it is the time for you to seek and ask other people's experience?                  "

And something kids may not like the food from the beginning cause it may not be cooked right, or it may have the lunch lady hair in it, and lunch ladies should ware hair nets when they cook the food in the morning and after noon.

And this should be for the bananas too if they don't look good you should throw it away and some other food it are past days. well a lot of kids dont care about what they eat only if its good. And Chips or other snacks shoudn't be taking away either mostly poeple like snacks more then food. it would be better just too leave the food alone and let people enjoy it. "

He started feeling more pain when he studying his final years of high school. When he went through the surgery, he had exams going on. Despite the pain, he studied for his exam and passed in flying colors. Many people cannot afford the surgeries for not only heart but for many organs in their body. So, I wanted to change that and help all the people in the world, so that they can live happily at least once in their lifetime.

It is one of the high-paying jobs in the world. My family was not able to treat my uncle because of not having enough money at that time, so I wanted to earn money and save lives at the same time as much as I could. In this way, every body in my family will not be able to endure all the pain they had even before I was born. I will do anything to keep my family happy.

In this world, we have more doctors in other fields but not much in the cardio field. I wanted to change that because half of the world's population has hidden heart defection, they don't know still, like my uncle. This is because of less cardiologists in the world. When people go to the heart surgeons, the doctors ask more money then the usual charge as there are only a few doctors in that field. People cannot afford the money they ask and just leave their defected hearts, they continue doing their day-to-day works. If this continues, then people will die without even enjoying their whole life in this world. I wil become a heart surgeon and charge my patients the money they can afford. With this I will also be happy and the people who come to me will also be happy as they get cured.

In conclusion, becoming a cardiologist is one of big dreams I want to achieve in my life. I will save people's lives only by costing them with affordable money. I won't let my fellow people go through what my uncle did, so I would do anything to save their lives. People are dying across the world because there are only a few doctors in that field and they also charge them high, so I will change these people's lives by doing the opposite of what the other doctors did. I want to change this world into a better place to live because everything here is money, so i hope i can change it.

3746,F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine.

The first reason is people's communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you haven't talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be.

The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you won't be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident.

Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the person's mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before.

The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the people's preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesn't have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device.

In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and don't wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology."
293,15B68B826F8D,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He believe people should try to do something new beyond what they already know. Being good at new things can make you feel more confident with yourself. I agree that people should try to do something new beyond what they already mastered because trying to do something new can make you feel more confident and experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself.

To begin with, trying to do something new can make you feel more confident with yourself. People can be more success in life knowing more things. If people are always scared on doing something else they will not have experiences in life and It can be hard for them to grow. For Example, I was working in a restaurant for so long I really knew how to do that job, but I wanted another job to get more money; however, I was scared on getting a new job, I thought I was not going to be good in at that, then someone told me that I should try that I will never know if I am good at something if I do not try. Now, I working in a new job, I am more confident, and I am one of the best workers in the restaurant. Therefore, If people do not try to do something new because they do not feel like good at that, they will never know if they were one of the best. Growing is part of trying if you failed, then you will learn from your experience.

Second, experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. Sometimes you have to let go what you already mastered and start experimenting more about life, so you can not be stack on the same thing. Grow is difficult for the people who do not have experiences in life. For instance, When I came to this country I was so scared on learning a new language and how people will treat me, but start interacting with new people, learning about their countries, and trying different foods. Now, I can say that I have learn so much from other people and I realized that interacting with other people can make me grow in a way that I can feel more confident when I am around people. So, experimenting something else can make people matured and smart as well.

On the other hand, some people say that trying to do something beyond what you already mastered, do not make you grow. They say that people that are good at something should not be evolved in something else because they could get lost knowing different things, but I believe people will never get lost learning new things, learning is the key of growing. For Example, my friend is soccer player he is really good and he started learning to play baseball, he became good at both sports. That shows that people can be good at different things at the same time without lost what they already know. Therefore, trying something new can make you good at different things and discover talents that you did not know that you have.

To conclude, trying to do something else beyond what you already mastered will make you grow. People can discover more about themselves, grow with the experiences on tying to do something, and if they failed they will learn from that. Life give us that opportunity to mastered different things, learning something new make us be more confident and success on life. We should try to do something else maybe we are not good at that, but at least we try to do it and get something with us. Life could be bored if you are stack doing what you already know and not trying something else."
3301,E501D2D7FC83,"According to the prompt i would have to agree because impression is something you get when you get to see a old picture of you when you was a kid, or when someone makes a surprise for you, you get that impression , you start crying or just smiling .

For example,one of my experiences was meeting my whole family for the first time in my life, when we came to the united states my first impression was that i saw a lot of new things , a lot of nice cars , big houses , and a lot of people.

We stayed in texas for 2 days, we call my uncle the first day we stayed in texas, he told everyone in my family that we made it , we took different buses like for 3 days just to get to were my family was.

When we get there they went to pick us up , my first impression was to see all my family back again and that impression i will never forget it , and it will be never be change.

We went to my grandmother's house, i was nervous because in that day i haven't see my dad for more than 8 years, and when he came through the door i got that impression of seeing him again, i was so happy to see him again."
2238,A7627F0E8E33,"When a problem occurs, do you try your best or do you simply not care? Problems are a common thing and happens to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, you'll try hard to fix it. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.

There are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.

An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.

Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and it's okay to do so.

There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. You have to try your best when a problem presents, sometimes what seems right can turn out very wrong. You need to think if others will be effected, you can't just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best.""

No matter what you should always try your best, not only when a problem comes up. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around. Some of these things will teach you lessons, maybe you did the wrong thing but you'll be wiser and know better. Everyone goes through something, tough problems can happen to anyone you just need to keep your head up and do what is right."
2436,B50C9D328FAD,"If you could visit one place in the world where would it be? One place that I would like to visit is Pakistan. Here are some reasons why I would like to visit this place. First, it is known for it's parks. Secondly, the food is amazing. Lastly, Pakistan is one of the nicest culture. As you can see, Pakistan is an excellent place to visit.

Pakistan is known for some of it's best amusement parks. One place I would go to is Aladdin park. It's an amusement park with a lot of thrilling rides. I could go on the chair lifts. They are so awesome. Another place I would go to is Sea view. It's a beach. There I could go on horse and camel rides. The rides are exhilarating. About three or four people can ride the camel at the same time. They take you all the way to the water than back to where you started. Another place I would go to is Safari Park. It is an amusement park /zoo. There is a section for animals. You can go on a safari ride to see them. One of the best part about the ride is that you get to go to the elephants cage. There you can pet the elephant, you can even feed it, and you can go inside the cage if you want to go close to it. As you can see, Pakistan has variety of places to go so you won't get bored.

Food. It's the most important thing..right? When I wake in the morning after an awesome night. I will be hungry. So I start my day first by going to the local breakfast shop. There I will order eggs with some round hot parathas, and than some hot piping chai. Then when it's lunch time I will go to a fast food restaurant. There I will order a chicken burger with yummy fires and soda. When night comes around it will be time for dinner. For dinner I will go to a local restaurant. There I will order steaming hot Chicken Korma with buttery naan and Mango lassi. For desert I will have hot gulabgamun. They are like little doughnut balls covered with sugar syrup, and are very soft. As you can see, Pakistani cuisine is very delicious.

The people are very nice in

Pakistan. Wherever you go you would see people helping out each other. They are very welcoming and kind. They treat each other like they all are equal. They laugh, talk, and they just have fun. They don't disrespect each other, they take care of each other, and are very grateful. They are very protective towards each other. They're like a community and support one another. As you can see, Pakistani culture/people are the best.

In conclusion, I would say that Pakistan is awesome. So get your plane ticket right now and come to Pakistan. It is one of the best country you could visit."
2168,A1DE235AFFC8,"What are we in the future. Who are we now from then. How did we get this way. The fact is a lot of people are born everyday. We can not stop who people are and become. Character traits start in ones teenage years. When you grow big you keep some and throw some. If it was your choice or some else who influence. There are a lot of people who change them selves. People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you.

When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You can't have character if you don't want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you. Like right now there are to Women right now one is dressed nice has done her hair. She like to be fancy she blow her nose outside. She teaches Spanish I think so she travels for sure. She actually beautiful so you know she married. This another women is dressed causal and is wear a school jacket. She has a bun

But seems to be nice. She teaches science she most be smarts.

You thoughts of a lot of traits for them. How do you think they built them. They lived in different house and different schools and have a lot of different traits. Everyone can different trait and same one. You can never find someone with all the same traits. People see them in other and copy. People learn from them selves and make them. Traits are something you learn and keep.

Now if traits were something beyond your control thats different. If something beyond are control was doing this you'd think different. If you are talking about TV thats cool yeah I think so but not like that. TV is kinda like school but a lot of different things. You learn a lot of things from the TV that aren't the same. So you build off that. If you are talking like someone controlling of thats a whole different story. People would be more a like and thats how you tell we are in control.

People make their on character always. People will always be different from others . We all want to be are own person in the near future. Who wants to be someone else thats boring. We make new character and be are selves. We have control over who we are. You can live the same life as everyone and end up different. You control your own life."
2445,B59B6731525B,"If you were in the middle of the situation, and struggle with making decision. You try to asked one of your friend, but still don't have an answer for it. Next time, try to ask or talk to more people. But why getting more opinion is helpful for you? Getting multiple opinion can help you get a better idea, more choices to choose from, and help you make a good decision.

Asking for opinion can help you get a better idea. Imagine a time when you were writing an essay. You ask your mom to give you her opinion. But that didn't enough for your essay. Then, you ask your dad and your sister. Now, you have three opinion from different people. You can combine those opinion together to make it a better idea. Getting better idea will help for writing an essay.

Getting more opinion can also help you have more choices to choose from. You continues to ask for opinion from people around you. Now, you are a billionaire with many different opinion. You can use it however you want. You will decide you want to ""spend"" it or keep it for another time, like you are holding your own little world.

You will get more choices to choose from by asking people around you.

Talk to people for their opinion can help you make good decision. You don't know what college should you go to? Ask your parent, they will know what good for you. But, sometime people don't always choose the better one for you. So, you have to decide which option you want to take. People's opinion will help you make a good decision.

Getting opinion will always helpful for you, if you know how to use it correctly.

Listen to people's opinion and then make your own decision. But you don't have to always follow people's opinion. You can make your own decision.

But, asking for opinion from people around you will help you a lot.  "
811,3EC60741B7BF,"Yes i agree with churchill's statement for the role that failure and because he never loss the enthusiasm of to keep up and that happened with the role that consists of going from failure to failure but never loss the enthusiasm.

The role is something that consists in a good jod but you have to know how you use because if you don't know how you use your role is going to failure or if some people that you have don't know use that thing. But if that happend don't loss the enthusiasm because if you want that you role going up and make more money or others things, don't loss the enthusiasm and you have to study more about role for learn more and for that you role don't going failure because in you role you can do new things, and you can do jobs with others people that have role you can work with they like a group and work for a big company where the can pay you much money and with that you can do another company more big by yourself about role or if you want to you can do a different company that you like it you can do a better jod only you have to learn more about the job that you want to take always if you want to take a good job you have to study first before you take the job like when you study more about role because if you don't study more for different job you job is going to failure like the role always happend in jobs that you don't know use but never loss the enthusiasm if you like the role, or others things.

The enthusiasm is something like when do you like something like a better jobs, role, or others things that you like to do that's enthusiasm or when you like to do a good mechanic or a good doctor and you say i going to do this because i like it is my dream do a good doctor or a good mechanic or others things but that's the enthusiasm do something that you like to do and never loss the enthusiasm because if you loss the enthusiasm you never going to do anithing that you want or that you like don't loss the enthusiasm never do like Churchill's he never loss the enthusiasm because he want to keep up with the role and he like the role he study more and he learn more about role. This is my ideas and examples about this question about the role that you have to know how use the role and if you don't know use you role is going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

2669,C537E278BAE6,"No they shouldn't add an hour more because we don't need the hour but they should completely change the time for waking up and getting ready to come to school at 8 because i feel like every kid will have energy and not fall asleep.

also i think they should put each class an hour like example math should be an hour also Science , English , geography because all we honestly do need is come to school get our education then go home we dont need all stuff they put like electives they just make the day more longer and waste of our time honestly thats my opinion and how i see it.

they should only put the one hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day i think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like i said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in.

after all they shouldn't make it an hour because its really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away so school can go more faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.        "
1295,6330EB716872,"Kindness,you may know it and I might know and everyone might know, but what is kindness? and why does kindness have such a huge impact on others?

First of all, what is kindness? well kindness is when you give back to others like doing big things like donating to charity or something small like holding the door for others, but what really is kindness? those are just simple things we do, but why? why help others? We choose to help others so then they can help others and we can show the world to be better. Kindness is the key to making someone happy or feel like giving back we help others so they can try to give back.

Secondly why does kindness have such a huge impact on others?

Well we all like giving back, some might disagree or agree but we just want the world to be a better place not just for ourselves but for your kids. You just want you and your kids to be nice, because one day they'll look back and be thankful that someone helped them by holding the door or complimented them and just like that they feel something inside them they feel happy just by one thing someone does they can have a HUDGE impact on them.

In conclusion, Kindness has a HUDGE impact on others and what really kindness means to you and me and by just doing the smallest things you can change someone and they can can also change someone because of you!"
1421,6CFD58799701,"Hi, my name is Generic_Name, nice to meet you.

I was looking for a job, and i see that here are hidding so, today i'm here because i think im a good candidate for this job, this job is really insterasting for me, and when i see it for the first time it attracks me, because i really like this kinda jobs, and i think that if you like your job you're gonna enjoy it, you also gonna take care about it, and you just gonna appreciate.

I'm also think did i have the characteritics that you are looking for, and when i see at the first i just realize the characteristics did i need to be hired, and i pretty sure did i get them, just with one exemption i need to get experience because i don't have any on this type of job's but, i am that type of person who learn really easily, im pretty sure did i can do this work, i'm also are a responsible person and i always make sure that my work is well done and always try to make as much i can, i'm also responsible to came all days at time, because i know that is really important to be a good employee.

I'm also respect my work mates, because i think that the work environment is gonna be really good if all us respect each other, preventing disagreements between us.

i'm also that type of person who try to stay away of the problems, i always try to prevent them, because i know how bad they can be, for example: Get me on trouble in my work, with my frinds, or with my work mates too, so i just try to stay away as much i can.

I'm also are a healthy person, i didn't have any healthy issues before and i didn't presented them now, i don't take any type of medication so i think i'm ready for this work."
3530,F032D40816C0,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family.

You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do.

Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good.

And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind.

Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle

Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Name's family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Name's family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Name's family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them.

In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person. "
1008,4D7E52C79A3D,"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home won't be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I don't think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they don't learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea won't work out.

Mostly, in every home there is problem which we don't want to share with anyone or we don't want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might don't want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they don't want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school.

Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they won't come to school, so they can have a day off.

I mean if a student can't learn something from school how could he or she learn from home.

However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them don't even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person don't care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning can't help it out. if you are out somewhere and you're teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying.

However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they can't learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I don't think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I don't think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher can't handle every student differently, so I don't think that this idea would work."
1228,5F467A8F3896,"What are people going do if they find themselves in a situation of danger because of meting the wrong person on social media? No body would like the idea of being on danger but if we do not know how to manege social media we all are in danger. What are people going to do if they find themselves all alone because they did not take the chance of meting someone new, o because they did not enjoy the little moments whit their family? How could someone think that human communication is not necessary? People would not have the chance of having a nice chat whit their family or friends. Although some people say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect because it helps people whit communication problems interact whit other people due social media, actually the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects because people miss priceless moments whit their family and friends and there is a high risk of meting someone dangerous on social media.

People say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect. This is because they think that it helps people whit communication problems interact whit others due social media. Many studies have showed that social media is very helpful for those people that are insecure of themselves to interact whit others not just from their city but whit people from different places in the world. Technology is advancing, and it is trying to help people whit different needs. In this case technology allows people from everywhere to communicate whit others does not matter the place they are.

It is a privilege for the people that are far away from their families. It is also a way that people use to get away from having uncomfortable chats whit people from their surroundings.

However the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects. Because people miss the opportunity of having nice moments whit their family,

their families start to break apart. That's the case of my cousin's family. they were a beautiful family but everything went apart because my cousin's wife spent most of her time on Facebook, where she found a random guy, so she left my cousin whit their three daughters and one son. social media can destroy families and relationships in seconds, but is our duty to enjoy our time whit the people that we love because we show the love that we feel for them and communication by technology can never do that. We do not know if one day the people we love are going to leave, but if they leave we are going to keep those priceless memories on our heart. Family is everything and we should never let anything get us apart from it.

Even if social media allows people from everywhere interact whit each other; there is a high risk of met whit someone dangerous. There are many cases where young ladies have being abducted.

This happen when young ladies decide to met boys from social media that result not being what they thought but kidnappers. Those kidnappers sale the young ladies, and this poor girls are forced to give up on themselves and work as prostitutes.

All of this could be avoided if we start to know better about the people near us instead of trying to met someone that we dont know anything about . It's important to recognize that social media have benefits if we know how to use it correctly, but we need to be careful because we have to know other people better before trusting them, and it is even better if we already have had a chat in person whit those people.

In conclusion the world is constantly changing and technology is an important factor in actuality, but in those cases where technology is used incorrectly many people can get damaged. Technology is not a need but is a benefit, and if we are allowed to use it, we should do it whit responsibility and not depend from it. In spit of the fact some people believe that technology is more than necessary, and that there is no need of human interaction because it helps people with communication problems, in truth the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has just negative effects because we can experience more than one danger; like losing our family or being forced to a prostitute. Communication in person is necessary, there is no better way of live our life than enjoying the time whit our family, the little chats and of curs taking the opportunity of get to know better each one near us. A computer or a phone can never transmit our feelings, and if people want to express themselves they do not have to be trapped on technology.            "
434,20CF9410DC4A,"Is a good or bad idea to choose a carrer being young?

To begin, in my opinion choose a career being a young student is a good idea because it is a great opportunity for them. Imagine people can choose their profession since their youthness. For example, if they think that they want to be a doctor and at that moment they do not like that profession, they can opt for other career on time. Also, taking that decision many people assure their future, for example if they know what to do when they come to the adult stage, they going to be successful because they going to learn many things since young, and that helps to get better their knowledge. Therefore, doing careers help to people to keep their mind busy in their careers and studying hard and using their time to do good things, like do not using drug or wasting their time being a vandal. As well, if all the people do it, the world will be a place full of privilege, with porfessional people around, having trust and support on each other.

To conclude, doing career is one of many opportunities that we have in this country, so we have to use it, because it help us to be good person and get better our skills to be a professional. Furthermore, we have to learn how to focus in really important things. Also, it teach us how to become a successful human and fight for our goals since young. As well, it is good to learn how to be a independant person because if you study hard, your future will be full of success, so you do not need other people to do anything you want.  "
2267,A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life.

If a student doesn't believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that student's life time. Student that doesn't think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student.

Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they don't try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldn't make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasn't my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if it's not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life."
2853,CF3DC2587708,"I'm strongly agree with the statement of Ralp Waldo Emerson, because unless a people try to do something the person gets more far away from the porpuse. and that happens because sometimes the people lost the interest, and sometimes because the people doesn't want to make an effort or is very difficult to solved it.

while, there are so many reasons why people that think that, their goals are very hard to achieve, because they have to do a lot of test, in those 4 semesters, homeworks, activities, but, suddenly a problem comes to the person life, which is that he has to work at night, have to take care of his mom, he have to pay rent, food, and it's very difficult to think about it, because in those cases is more problabbly that he leave school, and don't follow his dream of graduated from high school or university and get the job that he was dreaming with.

Therefore, even knowing that he was giving up, he started to create a plan, it was a bout a project that should chnge his life, some of his friends tell him, that he will never going to graduated, and that he wouldn't achieve his goal, but, he never give up, and when summer cames. He graduated from the university, 4 months later, he created his own bussiness of tourism and travel.

As a result, he was trying to do something that someone else wasn't doing, he was trying to grow up someting that should make big changes in his life, and in his family. However, I support that sometimes is good to make some changes to your plan, i'm trying to do the same thing, I'm doing my best, to achieve my goals."
2279,AA53069FF4B4,"I believe that working in groups benefits more than someone working alone. Working in groups help you gather more knowledge, you get to learn and have fun, and you get to finish faster.

When my group comes together, we all start giving each other ideas of our own knowledge to make the project successful. Although some may know more than others, but others may know things that some dont. I also like when my group shares ideas because are project can be much more creative. Some people may believe that someone working alone can also have as much knowledge than someone working in groups. However I believe that working in groups can benefit you on having more knowledge.

Getting together with my group makes learning fun. When we start the project every one would start concentrated so that when we get close to finishing we can talk to each other. People would quietly take a break and talk so that they dont get overwhelmed. . Although, some people may believe that being groups detracts and working alone does not. However, getting detracted is something you would choose to do and not something I would choose to do.

I always felt like being in groups time would pass really fast. In a group everyone would choose what they wanna work on or work on something they know more of. When everyone is working on something it reminds me of a job, because every job wants to make the job done as soon as possible. When time flies i feel good because the job is done and i get to relax. Some people may believe that students that work alone like to take there time and do there project at there own style and make it knit. However, I am a type of guy that likes to get my job done and quick, and I believe there is a lot of people that are the same type.

In conclusion, working in groups benefits you more because of all of these reasons. Finally, I suggest that every one should try to make or find a group so that all these reasons open up to you."
3572,F1A4167422E2,"I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home.

After school many students might have something to do or attend. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine.

They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they won't be late. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home.

Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. Think about it. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away.

In conclusion The school board shouldn't add an extra hour and a half to each school. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. And,their wouldn't be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.     "
3597,F2BAC6095D8A,"I belive that students would work more effectivelly online rather, then sitting in a class room all day and not engaring in there learning rather then talking to there friends and being sociable.

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work .

Many kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .

Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

Many parents do benifit from this great advantage becuase the student can take a class knowing that the parent will give suport to the kid in his or her future carrer. "
1682,7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them.

Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.

Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesn't have any and stays at home playing video games. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.

However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.

Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.

It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.

As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Those were my ."
1516,74CE2F003968,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?

It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.

Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.

Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.

Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time. Which if they have kids or teenagers the online claeese can be benefitationl bacuse they can speent time with their kids and teen to see if they are doign good in school.

And the end the technology make the lifes easly and helpful;safe time,make anything be done on the time, so we can say technology refund the time for these who always busy."
658,331103D7D5CF,"""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing, "" said by the philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. Giving a good example by your own experience might influence other people; it depends on the situation. In my opinion, giving a good example is not the only thing to influence people as said in the quote, but there are things other than setting a good examples that influence people. For example, if someone had experience in playing basketball, and another guy was a beginner, it will be helpful if the experienced one helps him and shows him how to play by training him, but if the experienced one tells the begginner person an example of how to shoot the ball but not by showing him, it wouldn't be helpful to him and won't influence him.

One of the reasons i think that example might not be helpful is because when time moves on, the way that things work changes. Some people when they set a good example to influence someone that need motivation, they set an example from their own experience that might be some years ago, That can create a problem. For example, if a computer science major who graduated 10 years ago, and another one who just started college to study computer science and have some obstacles, if the major gave examples to the other guy about what he did in college 10 years ago to influence him, it would be a problem because as time goes we humans move forward in technology and we develop the education, so if the major gave the other guy his own experience it would be different than college now. This example won't help the guy who just started college, but it would be better if the major showed him the way to study and try to explain to him things.

Sometimes people understand examples wrongly and influence others in an incorrect way, and it can be a big problem, It can turn motivation into failure. For example, there was a famous quote saying that failing many times without loss of enthusiasm leads to success, if someone study medicine in college and then he found himself failing tests and projects, but he took this quote as his influencer and he didn't lose enthusiasm, maybe after a while when he find himself still getting the same grades, he will lose enthusiasm and he will give up. The problem here is that he misunderstood the quote, the quote meant that he shouldn't loss enthusiasm even if he fail many times, but he thought that after failing two or three times he will do more better.

Some people may argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the only and best way to influence other people, because they think that if people follow the examples of the experienced people, they will succeed and will be motivated to do more work. For example, if someone successful gave an example of how he became successful, and what obstacles did stop him, and how did he get through them, Maybe some teenager listen to him and become influenced, and then he work hard to become like the successful guy. Or maybe someone who failed in something listen to the successful guy and learn how did he get through the things that stopped him, and then he become motivated to be successful and he work hard to reach his goal.

In conclusion, influencing others by your own experience might be helpful to some people, but also it can become a problem and not helpful to alot of people. Furthermor, using examples from your own behavior is not the only way to influence others, thats why i disagree with the quote, because examples could be perfect, but it is not the best or the only way. There are other ways as i mentioned, that could turn people's lifes from failure to success."
2291,AB2FD69DBACF,"""Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose think about the effects of allowing students, to have and use cell phones in the classroom. Students think that cell phone use will make easy to study and to get high grades, every teacher, students and parent are debating if they should let students use the phone during class.

Cell phones can be used for good reasons like study look for information, thats right that make school easier but at the same time is a distraction for students, because cell phones not only can be use to study, they can be use to communique play video games and thats a distraction for every student. That makes everything go back works instead of going forward.

also cell phones make easier for teacher to grade, now you can scan papers with phones and you can make grades for every student, but still is a distraction, am saying this because I am a student and the same happens to me, i know what it is and i think we should not use cell phones during class not even to do homework or anything relacionated with school.

To not have those types of problems we should let have every student have a computer, computer are more useful to search for problems, articles, to write etc. This will make more easier school than having phones during class, school should work more on this and all this is for a better if for good of our country to have better jobs better doctors, nurses etc.

I disagree on this article because cell phones are a distraction for students, i think thats why computers were made to use, to work, study, applications, papers, images and more, school should make this up and let students use a computer in class better than phone use, like i said do it for a better life, for more knowledge, to be safe and prepared for any circumstances that can show up to life."
