192,0E9FC972215F,"Dear principal,

I am very honored to write to you this letter and i pray you take time from your busy schedule and read this this letter .

i hope you are doing good as i am here.

i also want to say that i am happy to be a student in your school.

first of all i take a stand on your decision of changing the school food to a very healthier one and say it a very good one.

it's a very thoughtful idea , and it's also shows that you love the school and i appreciate you for such a great idea. it's a good idea because, half of the student have allergic reaction to some food the chief's cook so they rather go hungry or have an empty stomach and if such incident still goes on, student might even pass out one day.

secondly, if we get healthier food, we will be active and our brains will be able to function well as soon as class start. However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well , and it's also help make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day.

and not only does it work for the brain, it's also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body.

lastly , changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it . Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food , and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste and it's will make the school loose money.

so therefore, i will end my speech by saying that it's a very good and and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again i hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter. "
2491,B950C326FB77,"First impressions are always the most important thing when you meet someone you want them to think good of you so you do your best to make them feel comfortable around you. If you make a bad impression the first time with probably that person It is going to think that you are like that forever. There is no way you can change what others think even when you have not talk to them,people think what they want to think and it is hard to change their thoughts. You can do a couple of thinks to make them trust you and change their perspective about you: like be kind,ask them about what they like,etc. Start a conversation that makes them feel they can talk with you about whatever they want,however sometimes things like that do not work and simply you just can not change what other people thinks that is why you should try to make a good impression the time you talk with a new person that is the reason why first impressions are important. "
2140,9FE689F5F44D,"Achieving the knowledge based on the books or on the notebooks is common but achieving a knowledge by involving in the extracurricular activities is a different and extra. School is the place where students get suggestion, get inspire, and get strength to accomplish their goals. From school, students can learn optimum knowledge and experiences about the inside and outside of the books as well. In addition, school is the career building place for the students. School is the best place to evaluate the skills and the capability of each students. By controlling students involvement in the extracurricular activities, many students can fulfill their dreams which gives them happiness and makes them feel special by doing it. Also, gives them a wings of hope to do something more and make their parents and themselves proud tomorrow.

As we all know that, if the students doesn't have that ability and interest in order to take a particular class then school never force students to involve in those particular class or field. But, talking about family, there are maximum parents who force their children to take a class and choose a career as they want. There are many parents who wants their children to become a doctor, pilot or engineer; though, their children doesn't have any interest on that faculty. In other words, though their children are weak in math and science, but their parents wants to make them, a doctor, pilot or engineer. It's only because according to the parents, only doctor and pilot can make a huge money and has a great reputation. At this situation, we have seen many cases that parents do emotionally blackmail to their children. In that condition, children sacrifice their dreams just to make their parents happy. We all know, every student do not wants to become a doctor and pilot. They have their own dreams and interests on particular faculty. For example, if a student is interested and good on soccer but his parents do not support to his interest because they feel it's a waste of time. But, school always support him. According to the parents their children should be good on knowledge based on books rather than extracurricular activities. They should have only focus towards their study which is totally wrong.

If schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities then it can show a right path and right decision for the student's bright future. Schools are available with each and every information regarding the bright future of students. If a student is interested on an art then teacher let them to take that class with a huge strength.

School knows every skills and talent about their student because they spend more time with their teachers, counselor, friends and their coach than their family. In fact, they share everything about their interest to their teachers and counselors because they understand them. But they do not share those kind of things with their family because family gives only pressure instead of understanding their children's interest. If a student is good on photography then school is the only one who gives more information and put more efforts to help them through different strategies. They try very hard that how students will feel easy and comfortable. Students are also able to learn different knowledge through the school's coach. Coach is the only one who teach, tell and motivate students about their strong and weak point through which student can do better today and give their best tomorrow than yesterday.

School provides a beautiful and colorful feathers to the students in order to fulfill their dreams in which faculty they are interested and dying to do for it; only by controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities. There are many students who do not have any interest on their study, who do not have any interest on the words written on their notebooks, who do not have any interest to become a doctor, engineer or pilot. Instead, who are interested to become a famous photographer, to become a great dancer, singer and a great actor. These dreams will be remain on dream until they do not get any supports from anyone, if they do not get any motivators to motivate them and also if anyone won't become their inspiration to inspire and encourage them. Similarly, school is that place which do not give their student's dream remain on dream; school helps students to give all those things which are needed to them; by motivating, encouraging and being inspiration for the students. It also provides an elective classes and other different activities to make them feel happy and special or in order to let their colorful feathers fly in the high sky and able to touch and feel it.

At the end, we can see that there are many benefits for the students which also teach them about the importance of extracurricular activities. Therefore, school is that place where it motivate, gives a strong strength to accomplish student's passions, suggest students to go through their interest and teach many significance knowledge about the educational experiences. Because of the schools control student involvement in the extracurricular activities, students can accomplish their interests, dreams and make their career in a particular activity in which they are interested, in which they see a big hope, declare it as their passion and happiness. I believe that not only the students, everyone should follow their passions and see success will comes towards you itself because all we need is our happiness. It is only possible if the schools control students involvement in the extracurricular activities rather than giving decisions to the family and student for the involvement in the extracurricular activities.

Working in Groups or Alone

In school sometimes we work in groups and sometimes we work alone. Working alone is fine because we don't get headaches from classmates; however, working in in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. Working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates, we get more opinions, and it takes less time doing the assignment.

First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates. Each person has their own part to do and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classamtes.

Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person. We don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help. Working in groups is better because we get more ideas.

Finally, working in group is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. It will take less time because we will get more support and all the work don't will be completed just by one person. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone. Working in groups is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed.

In conclusion, working in groups is better because we divide the work with our classmates, we don't have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help, and the assignment will take less time to be completed. Working in groups is a gift. "
491,253B2D521F14,"Do you think starting a career at a young age is good? Many students think that starting a career at a young age is good, but its is not a good thing for them or in general. Students often choose to start it at an early age because they could be really excited about it. I think that them focusing on their studies until they get older is even more better, and it would be a great thing to do. And instead of the young students hanging out with their friends at somewhere thats unrelated to their career or studies, they should maybe go to a tutoring center or help each other. Students should also have time to think about and choose a career that they think they would focus on really well. If students start a career at a young age, it can have quite many consequences. Usually doing so would make them more likely to have failure in their career, lack of some education, and they won't get much respect from people.

One of the reasons why I think that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they will more likely to have failure in their career. If they have failure in their career, there will be many problems. One of the problems that could happen is that they could get sued if if they end up doing something wrong. Another thing that could happen is that they could get many complaints about things. And if people complain about them and if they make bad reviews about them, it will make their image look bad. And for that they might not be making a lot of money out of their profit, because people know what failures they are.

Another reason why I think that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they will lack some education.

If they lack some education, they won't be able to know a lot about their career. Its just like a chicken is running to get to the other side of the road with his head cut off. One thing they will also have trouble in is interviews. They will not be going to get success if they don't know much. And if they don't know anything about their career, that person could get fired. One of the things that they would also be doing is making a lot of mistakes. The students should stay much longer in school to get proper knowledge of that career so that they will earn success.

Another reason that students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age is because they won't get respect as much as a well educated person that knows all their studies and who knows a lot about their career, if they do so. People would probably ask them that why didn't they take their studies further. Also, and what they could've done before to fix this situation is that they could've gotten help from others such as their friends, teachers, by staying after school for extra help, or asking their parents to hire a tutor. Additionally, or what they could do instead of getting extra help, is that they could just focus in their career class and not slack off. They should also do a career that they're interested in. Because a lot of the times when they see that one of their friends chose this one career, then they will do the same one. That's why young students should always think and choose very wisely when it comes to picking career.

Young students should focus more on their studies and shouldn't commit to a career at a young age. They should all focus, and they should keep studying until they get much older, rather than choosing a career at a young age. It is also a very important to not have failures and mistakes in your career, so that your career turns out to be good. I think that young students should always study, and never lack any sort of education. Also, and that they should get the most of education to gain much more of peoples respect. By doing all of these things as a young student, they will achieve great success. By them not doing these things, they won't get much of their career success."
117,08D8232F2D78,"Examples are the main thing to influence others because the best way to show other people is to give them one example about your own experience and what you learned from that example in your life. Other may think that examples are not the main thing in influencing other. Because there are many others way by influencing others. Others don't want to share what happens in their life for examples.

The best way to show other people is to give them one example about your own experience. There are many other ways but example is more important. You let other people know something that you have learn it. For example, My parents are taking about them self last night their was taking about how can I influence my family in the future. They said, that the is a best way to influence them is through examples in my own experience.

What you learned from that examples in your life. Give other examples from what you learn in your own life would be a good way to influence that people. There are many people that are passing about what you had passing through. For example,Angie my best friend is in drugs and I don't want that she happens what happen to me. So, I give her a example about my experience in drugs that what happens to me is going to happen with her if she continue to consuming drugs.

In conclusion, Example is the main thing to influence other because the best way is through examples. You learn from the example in your life. Many people need to know our experience to know what are they doing. people want to know the consequences of what is going to happen to them based on our experience."
2894,D175411080CC,"Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. Schools should limit on how much extracurricular activities they can do, having too much will cause confusion among students in class and too much is always not good. having their families decide for them is an option, but the best decision should be for the school, for they know how well the student is doing.

Research from age between 21 to 26 shows that 95% of them wanted to decide for their children,They wanted the best for them and the best they will do, That is the job of the parents. A blog back in 2006 shows that people who decides for their children most likely to get a job than people who decide on their own.

A Research conducted back in 2010 shows that 80% of people prefer to decide for themselves, having them to decide will greatly benefit their mind and shows that they are responsible on how they act. They like to choose their own path and find their own talent. Finding their own talent shows responsibility, and having responsibilities at a young age takes courage, dedication, and hard work.

Having too many activities will also cause a lot of their energy to get drained, they won't have any energy to spare for other activities like cooking for dinner, or doing assignments. The school should keep track on every students activities, This ensure their safety and heath. Having every energy drained from your body is bad, and the school should keep track at their time as well. Having more energy will greatly benefit their health. The school is partly responsible for the students, but the parents are most responsible and should know what their children's are doing, if they think their doing too much, they should talk to them and have a simple chat about overworking.

The school can also add a one simple rule where people who has 3 activities or more should be given time at the end of each classes 15 to 30 minutes free time to discuss with their teacher on how well they are doing and to do missing work or assignments. In Generic_City, Philippines, University of Mang Totomas, Practice this method. Research from this school shows that students have increased their grades when they added this rule back in 1996, it increased from the average of 3.0 GPA to 4.1 GPA, This huge increase show's that adding this simple rule will benefit not only the students health, but their grades as well.

Hard work is good personal ethnic, but too much can lead to more bad than good, studying many subjects at one time can cause confusion and stress, The schools job is to teach students, and the students goal is to learn from school, if they want to learn an extra subject or do an extra activity, that's fine, but aslong as they don't over do it. the school system should ensure students safety to be top priority, and if their wearing themselves out with the extracurricular activities, they should notify their parents or limit how much extracurricular activities they can do."
3280,E3DF63035440,"I am agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. It is true that to be success first, you need to have a clear mind of what you want to be or to do. Because in some of the cases can be very struggle and difficult to be success. For example, a very famous statement says,

""After the storm comes the calm.""

This can be similar with the Churchill's statement. Because this explain that it does't matter how worst you see it but it would be great after the problems or you are struggle with.

Furthermore, to be successful you would pass by a hard things, for example something that people says,

""Nothing is impossible if you don't tried.""

and

""Nothing is easy in this life.""

This is a true statement that all people have to do and we have to know.

Additional, the word

""failure""

plays an important role to be success. One important thing is that if somebody loss her or his enthusiasm or will power can be worst because that means that you are giving up what you have already and for that you already worked for it and don't want to fight that victory of success anymore. Sometimes you can fail but that does't matter because if you tried and tried again and again after you can get it. That would be one of your goals that you would remember. This shows how important is going from failure to failure to be success.

Finally, to be success we would failure first because by that you would know what you did wrong and thats why failure pursuit an important role in our life to be success."
3637,F4F054797227,"I believe that people yes should make their own decisions and follow their instincts because that is what make us different from others. Follow your intincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be.

First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work.

The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right.

The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend. So make own ours decisions can make a big change ir our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are abuot to do. But always do it because you want to do it, not because other tell you. Always do may make you happy, no metter if you are wrong or not because that is what is going to make the difference.

In conclision yes people should follows their instincts and ideas. But also make their own decisions. Never stop doing that things that they like. Always do and follows what they believe and think carfully and what they want and where they want to be. The goods and bads decisiones and experiences and learn of they if what really teach you about life's important matter and make you succeed.       "
3814,FBE9FF521DD1,"Should the students work alone or work in group.

Students should work in group because they are going to have more ideas, they can help each other and, they can prepare their self for the future.

Student should work in group because they are going to have more ideas. For example the student can share ideas of the work with the group. Student have a different mining of the topic and they more ideas about how to do the work. And the student have different point of view, so they are going to share the ideas to the group to finish the work more faster. In conclusion student should work in group because they are going to have more ideas.

Students should work in group because they are going to receive more help. For example if a student do not understand the work other group member can help them so that they can understand. If the teacher do not have the time because she is helping others student to help a group member they can support each other. And the student have different ways to do the work so they can help each other to finish the work more faster. In conclusion the Students should work in group because they are going to receive more help.

Student should work in group because the student are going to prepare for the future. For example when they get out of school, and they have to work in a office with a group of people they are going to have the experience to share ideas and get and give support. When the student have a family they are going to support each other with the family member to solve any problem that they have in the way. In conclusion the Students should work in group because the student are going to prepare for the future.

Student should work alone because they are going to their work independence, however; It is better to work in group because students can help each other.

In conclusion for me the student in the school should working in group because they are going to have more ideas, more help and, they can prepare their self to the future."
538,293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success.

You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you don't study yourself at something you failed at, then you can't become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that won't happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice.

Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didn't feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then don't worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and can't move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past.

Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you won't reach to the top to become successful. For example, you can't swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont won't to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up.

In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better. "
1225,5F1183463E9D,"Thinking ahead of time of what you want to do after high school before you start high school may or may not be a good idea. For example it might get you prepared for what classes you can take your first year of high school. Because high school is all about getting good grade and getting the help you need to become what you want to become in life. High school is where you get your real start to your future. And here are some reasons why.

Thinking about what you want after high school before you even start could be beneficial to you. For example for some it might come as motivation. As in they are at a low point in life where things arent going so great, they could think about what they want tot do and see them selves in the future becoming what they wanted to become. It could even benefit you your first year of high school like picking your classes. You would pick the classes that are most related to the career you want to pursue. Another big thing that is good about looking into what you want to do before high school is the collages as well. Some collages might have the the class you need to finish and major in what you are studying for. It is like a head start on one the classes you take in high school, two the rest of your high school years, three the collage you want to get into.

But there are always some downs to thinking and or knowing what you want to do before you even get to high school. Such as there might not be a class for what you want to major in. Or you might not be eligible for taking that class , they could be over booked in those classes. There might be mix ups with your schedule that may cause you not to get the class you wanted. Even when you have your mind set on one thing for your future your opinion may change over time it may even change completely. And it happens to a lot of students. They make up there minds and then maybe weeks later it may change into something else. There are also other issues with what you want to do in your future. Some students work full time jobs and its hard for those students to focus on one goal and keep up with school work , Sometimes even miss school just because of work. If you think about it even after graduating high school some still work and move on to collage and are still stuck in the mud with work and even harder homework and class work. So dont have a ride to school or even work. Money is a big issue as well. With having to pay for a car or even other life needs you might not be able to get into the collage you want to get into because of how expensive it is. There are student loans but you still have to pay that back and sometimes you can be late on payments but then that doubles and no one wants that.

High school is where your future really begins really. Because if you think about it is where you start learning about where to get your start , how to start , when to start . This is where we as students decide what we want to do in life and where we want to go with it . And if we chose to chance our dream that thats where we end p with hard work and dedication.                   "
527,28494A144B1A,"Character traits are what define a person. there are what make one person different the another. Although some people believe we choose our own character, nevertheless, our character are influences beyond our control because technology influences our traits and famous people can influences our traits and our parents influences our traits by they expectations.

To begin, video game can influenced our traits. For example, my own experience say

3 year ago I start play video game, when I star play with my friends. We always say that when we grow up we like to do what they are doing because their life look good. Also, we start doing the same things as the game like dancing, and thinking same as the game, and acting like them. Our others friends who do not play the game they tell us, that we are change our traits because we are acting like them too. One day we released that game was influenced our character. Clearly, because we star thinking in the future our life same as the game, and that we can do our future as we see in the game easily.

Furthermore, famous people influenced our traits. To continue with my experiences in things that I was influence, for example, when I was 12 year old. one day I was on YouTube, and I star see some videos about bloggers beauty, where they have a lot of makeup I do not use any makeup at the age, but when I see that they do their makeup, and look so beautiful I start doing my makeup, and think because I

was wearing makeup I look good, one they my mom ask me, why I am wear makeup, if I told her that I do not like makeup, I just say because they do their makeup. Then, now that I am 19 year old, I released that I was doing things that I do not like because they are doing. clearly, this prove me that I was influences for a famous beauty.

Finally, our parents influences our traits by they expectations. I will say something our parents want we do what they want. For example, we want to go out we are friends, and we ask our parents if we can go they say not, because they thing that our friend is a bad person. Also, they want to change our thought saying that bad thing about our friends, and finally they change are though about our friends. This show that, our parents can change our expectations about our friends. Clearly, parents always want we do what they want, and we always want they want because we do not them mad with us.

To concluded, our character are influenced beyond our control because video game can influences are traits and famous people can influences our traits, and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. technology influenced our character in form that we that life be like them and people can influence our change in the form the we do thing only, because we see they are doing then older people want to change our though to what they thing. To conclude, our character traits can be influences in different ways that we never expect that can happen. "
2164,A1C1C0FE3C7A,"The best thing about on this statement is how can I learn about us, maybe are you will say how?

well that easy we have to see who we are or maybe what we going to do

I have a many reasons to show and too see how can I show the people who we are?

well that's easy.

The first thing what we have to see is how we wanna say the thing examples we don't have to never give up never say no just do it and you not take care what the people is wanna say you can do whatever you want in your life just work up for it because we never did know what is wanna happened if you not take care what you want

The big reason I have in my life is some people want the thing we have maybe can be the opportunity the education family

Always i say the education is always came from the family because there is your power or your support for your future that why we have to be positive on that because we ready know that some people want the things what we have on us.

The opportunity what we got everyday or whatever we get we always we have to be thankful with everybody.    "
1282,623E0AD2EF3E,"Whats one place you would love to visit? One place I would like to visit is Ethiopia. I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years. Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members go eat Ethiopian food with them and cherish that moment forever.

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasn't the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country. I've lost a lot of people i've cared about those past three years and I couldnt do anything about it because i was a million miles away.

Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. I hate having to talk to them on the phone and not being able to hug or see them in person, I hate having only 30 minutes to talk on the phone when I can talk to my relatives for hours in person, I hate how I am paying two dollars everyday just to talk to them when we can talk for free in person. Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it.

Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever. I would go on long car rides because it would make some time for me and my family members to just sit and talk and have no where to go. We can go to the zoo since I never went and I would love to bond with my family members especially if its somewhere I never went before. My family members and I could have a cook out or I can just sleepover a friends house.

In conclusion, I would love to visit Ethiopia because my family and friends are there since i've missed so much while I was in America. I'd love to breathe the fresh air and eat the fresh food my grandma makes. Plus I would love to run around the backyard with my frirends."

Everyone is different we all have distinguishing quality's, put it this way if your an apple and your around mangos every day, is not goint to be different even if they trying to make you a mango your still going to be a aplee.

Going back to what John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

i belive this prompt is right we can choose our own character traits.

We can be happy, sad, angry, or crazy. People are not going to tell us when we can or can't do.

I dont like when people tell me staff for example, I dont like when people are trying to make me something im not. I can choose what i want to be. This is why i belive that we can choose our own character traits."
3253,E2A60C034849,"Some school's use cell phones for education. In Some school's cell phones are not allow. We the students think that cell phones are a good and usefull. Cell phones have internet and we can do a lot of our work with it. A cell phone its like a computer. The students think that we should use cell phones in education.

Cell phones have a lot of apps. The apps are easier to handle in a cell phone that in a computer. We the students already have apps for our cell phones were we can see our grades and school calendar. Also with school apps we can email our teachear. Students think thats one good reason to use or phones with education.

Cellphones are small and they still have it all. Rigth now students are using computer wich it harder because it makes our backpacks heavier, why dont we replacet them for a phone. Its beneficial for us. If we the students could handle a computer, we can handle a phone. Some people think that migth be a good option.

Cell phones have more facility to get into stuff. In cell phones everithing its abvaible, that means we can found a lot of stuff.. Definitions, apss, movies about education ect. To be abvaible to everithing its something beneficial for us. .Sometimes we need to watch and old movie and the teacher dont find it but if we have the cell phones everiyone would watching it separly. Cell phones are a good thing for the education.

Theres people that think that cellphones are a bad thing to the education. They think its not rigth to have a phe out in class. Some people think that cell phones are too avaible. They think they are distractive. They think its not the same think as a computer.

we see the two parts of this, one part its showing that we need phones and they are easier for and the other part its showing that they are a bad option. We

3135,DD265EC28AEB,"Now a days schools are finding new ways to use cell phones for educational purposes. Schools and teachers want to find new ways to educate students through cell phones since every child is attracted to them. But with schools trying to find ways that works, it does have its negative effects to it. The effects with using cell phones in classroom for educational purposes is that many students will end up getting off tasks, no more hands on learning, and they will start to relying too much on their cell phones. With cell phones being use for educational purpose, it has its negative effects to it and will affect student's learning in the process.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will not focus or get off task in their classes. If they use cell phones in classroom for a method to educate people, students with tend to get distracted on their phones and not learn what they are suppose to teach. Students will also end up dozing off and start to listen to music or even end up playing games on their phones and not focus on what's being taught. Also with social media being so big now a days students will focus more on texting friends or being on their Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter rather than focusing on what teacher is showing the classroom. With cell phones being use in classroom, students will end up getting more distracted and off task than when you do not use cell phones in the classroom to teach. The next paragraph will talk about another reason why using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has its negative effect.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that there is no more hands on learning for students. If school are using cell phones as a method to teach people, the students are not getting the hands on learning that they should get. Back then before everyone had a cell phone the way they were taught was with the step by step on doing the work and trying to understand how you ended up doing the work. But if they use cell phones in the classrooms the students would not be getting the step by step understanding of the work, rather than they doing it on the phones and just getting the answers. With schools using phones in the classroom the students would not be getting the same knowledge and understanding to specific problems and work than those who learn the step by step learning to the problems. In the next paragraph we will see another reason why using cell phones for educational purposes has a negative effect in the classrooms.

As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will end up relying too much on their cell phones and technology to get the work done. As the more classroom or schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes the students will end up relying on their phone to get the work done for them and not try to do it theresleves. For example imagine students cell phones end up not working and they only used their cell phones to get the work done, what are they going to do now if they only use their phone to do the work and they did not learn the material on their own. With schools using phones as a way of teaching it with effect the students ways of learning and will start to rely on his/her phone in the later future to get their stuff done. In the last paragraph it will concluded the paper and sum up everything about the paper.

In conclusion if more and more schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes they will make more students get distracted during class, not have the hands on learning they should have, and also they will start to rely on their cell phones more for the work rather than them trying to do the work them self. With cell phones trying to be used as a method of learning, it will end up not giving the students the education they need but rather them showing a way to get the work done quicker without all the extra work that should be done. So schools should stick with the methods they have now and not try to add cell phones as another method of teaching these students. "
185,0E14B9D24898,"I think that the curfew is good idea for adopting because at least sudents will not dying on the streets and they will not be no loneliness for them. Teens would not braking the law if they were not in big trouble. For teens there will be no street fights, crime, shooting weapons, etc. The curfew will take care of them at least temporary or it depends. Government need to take care of homeless teens. Those who drop high school early is too bad because some students desided do not learning and try hard their subjects. They will not success in future without educarion. In real world no one need them because they are not educated, did not complete high school and there are take care by themsellve on the streets. After curfew they leaving,

found minimum job with payment good for them, at least teens did something in their life. Their big mistake that ignor, lazy, skiping school, worse grades, attitude, not respect, selfphone and etc. If teens will not changing their minds, posobility well end up in wrong way. But I hope that they will succeed in future."
31,0316F6288791,"The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college.

Even thought some people might say students shouldn't take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest.

concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they don't put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers.

according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes.

concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.

817,3F2941C11D95,"By extending the school day two hours, students and teachers will have more advantages to learn and to teach.

I agree to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. There are many reasons of why it will be better and will benefit us as students. One of the reasons is that we will have more time in the weekend to review our notes, homework, and things that we need help with. Another reason is that we will be doing the same forty hours of school even if we will have a four-day school week. It also will benefit teachers by increasing their time to review test or projects made by the students.

Most of the time there are things at school that we do not really understand, and a four-day school week will give us more time to study and review these things at home. We the students have the opportunity to go to school and graduate, but also some of us have obligations and responsibilities. For example in my personal life, I have to work after school everyday. And most of the time when I get home, I feel tired and I just go to sleep, I forget if I have homework or not. Therefore this model will give us more time to work and being less worry about going to school five-day week. We can concentrate at school four days and the other day we can work and do homework or projects when we have to.

Also a four-day school week will benefit us because we will be doing the same forty hours. Therefore our grades and education would not change. And I do not think that is necessary to study all five days, it is not about how many days do you go to school, is about how you take advantages from it. For example if you go to school everyday just to talk with your teammates, is like you were absent. For that reason I agree to extend the two hours of school, that way we can concentrate four days and having in mind that we will have three days to study or to keep learning at home.

Another reason of why I agree to extend the school day, is because it will benefit the teachers also. It will benefit the teachers by giving them more time to review and grade homework, projects or test that students took in the class. It also will give us the opportunity to spend more time with our families and people around us. For example, I work with my father in construction, and I almost do not see him all day until the night. This four-day school week, will give me the opportunity to spend a entire day working with him without being worry about the school for a day. And just like me, there is a lot of people who will be benefit from it.

Finally, school should be extended two hours day, that way we can have more time in the weekend to prepare for tests, teachers will have more time to grade them. And we will have three days to spend with our families.                     "
953,48F7FCAD8B23,"Will has you can see getting advice from other's is not a bad idea. I think getting advice from others has a great point of view and a bad point of view by the way someone can look at. When you are trying to get advice from someone remember to ask more then one person for advice. One of my reasons is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. My other reason is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. My last reason is asking people for advice can hurt it's not always going to make you happy.

My first statement is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. Most of the people in this world have different point of view for each person on the way they see them or maybe by the way they you act and look. Asking only one people is not a good idea because someone might just be looking at you how you look and how you dress. They might just say bad things to you because they thing your not worth nothing and they are the only one's that actually are worth something in this world. People in this time don't gave good advice to people because all they want to do is make people look bad in front of others.

My second statement is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. Will in my point of view asking people for advice is not a great idea because some people might just till you lies when you are asking for advice. Sometimes people just tell you lies because they know that you need help but all they are going to do is make you look bad. They are some people that all they want you is to suffer just because they are having problems at home. Getting advice form one person is not a good idea because you might not know if they hate you or that you might have done something that hurt them and you didn't know and you asked them for advice they would gave you bad advice just for what you did to them.

My last statement is that asking people that you thing that will tell you the truth no matter if it hurts or not is not a bad idea. They are some people that would tell you the truth even if it's going to hurt a lot but the only thing they want for you is too be happy. Asking people older then you is a great idea like your family because maybe they have been though a lot maybe they might even hate you or something else but they would never lie to you because you are there children they care about you. Getting advice is not bad it also can depend on the way you decide to take it if you take it as a good or bad way because most of the people that are always there in your bad a good moment always want the best thing for you because they love you.

In conclusion, asking for advice sometimes and talking to others more advice can help you make good choice but at the same times bad choice it all depend on you if you want to be a great or bad person. Everyone has there point of view to take the advice that someone gives you in a good or bad way. Mostly the people that love you are going to tell you the truth even though if it hurt because they know that later or after you are going to find out the truth.

In this world you should take most of the advice that other people gave you because they have already been thought a lot but they don't want you to through the same thing because they actually want you to be someone if life even if they couldn't be someone in life. The advice that someone gives you is not bad it to help you see how hard they work because they didn't take the advice that they gave you are they didn't get the chance like you have so if someone gives you a great advice you should be grateful."
794,3DC3405DF531,all tho some people say online classes is good. they have their reasons. Tacking online classes i good it has it's bad. if you take online classes you can stay home and dont you don't have to go to a school building and you don't have to wake up early and go to school and you wouldn have to go to school and see people you dont want to see and you dont have to eat the school lunch you can eat whatever you want to eat when ever you want to eat and you wouldnt have to follow and rule you can make you one rolls and it would be esyer to take a test when you online classes cuz you can look things up on the internet and pass you test but when you you in school you have wake up early and get ready to go on the buss and you have to go to your classes on time and then you have to sit in a small class and sit in a desk and do your school work and you have to follow rule like you would have to go to your classes on time and if you do make it to class on time then you would have to go to the tarty table and if you keep doing it you would happen more then three times you would have to go to iss and what iss is you would sit in this quit room with out your phone and and you cant talk anyone. and is you dont go to class at all they will find you and put you in iis and they will call you mom or dad or email your mom or dad telling them that you wasnt in school and i dont know about you but my parents would get mad that i wasnt in school when they saw me go to school in the morning. And when you disrespect your teacher they will call security on you and they will come and get you and tall to you. And if you get in a fight with a student then you will be in a big trouble the security will come and get you and it its really bad they will call an ambles and this time the principle and the police and parents will get involved and the other person parents might press charges and that would not be good for you on your reared beauty when you apply for coleg they will see that you had a bad history and they wont want that tiyp of beaver in their school so you would be hurting your fucher. And if you do or take drugs or sell drugs in school then you would be in soo much trouble with the school and with the police and you parents and you could go well if your eithing and older and if your danger then that you would go to jive. and you would probably be kicked out of school and you would have to go to a new school and love all your friends and you wound have the same friends in the same school as you and that would be so sad and you wound have to go to jell and earthing so i think it beter to go to the online classes not that i get to eat all i want but becuth it a lot going on in schools that you have to go thour and you mith not like it i think it would be a good exprmnt to try online classes 
661,331D60E145C4,"One time in high school I met a teacher who looked like a mean person and who didn't like to interact with students or explain over again the stuff that he taught, so I went to talk to my counselor about if there were any possibilities if I could change the class, but she said no. After a while of taking his class, I realized that he is a very good teacher and a very nice person because every time I asked him for help, he would always tried his best to make me understand the topic and do good on my quizzes/ test. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people say that you can know someone's character by just the first impression. First impression are possible to change because they might had a bad day, and you always have to know the character before in order to judge it.

People all over the world are always going to have bad days, and that's normal because life consists on having good days and bad days; if you're having a bad day, of course you won't have a good attitude towards people. For example, some people can have problem at their house, work, school, etc... and obviously that's going to affect on their behavior and they might treat you good or bad, it depends on the situation. When you first see someone and they seems like a bad person, that doesn't mean he is a mean person; he can just be having a bad day or something bad happened. In order to judge someone you have to know the character first.

In life you can't be walking judging people just because they did something or just by their looks. For example,The majority of the population in the whole world knows the saying ""

Don't judge a book by its cover

"" this meas that just by looking at person from his outside, doesn't mean they are going to be like that on the inside. People might look either a mean person or a good person, there is some people that look like they are a good person and that they have a nice behavior, but at the end of the story they might do you wrong and you are going to be the one losing by trusting the person by just thinking they had "" a good personality""; However, there is also the people that looks like a ""bad person"" but some of those people can be nice from the inside, and you might need help from them at one point.

In conclusion, first impression are possible to change because people might be just having a bad day, and also because after you get to know the character as they originally are, then you are going to start thinking differently about that person. It's important for you to know the character first before you start judging that person, because you never know if that one person that you rejected/judge at the beginning, can be the person that you need the most in the future.

Its very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time.

People that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or don't fail.

The British prime minister probably has fail in the past years when he was younger and was successful after he learned from his mistakes. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesn't happened in the future.

Here is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the name's for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. People that have wanted to start their own coffee shop business or other kinds of business, doesn't always work out for them for some reasons and are not very successful when doing the planing their ideas and would want to hire someone to help them come up with more ideas. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time.

Overall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life. "
2012,982053C6DAD6,"Taking advantage of opportunities at a young age will significantly impact your future abilities of choosing your correct career path. Futhermore, when you're young, you have more time to research about the career that you are interested in. Most teenagers at a young age choose multiple careers of what is most interesting and cool looking to them. What's very important is that the particular person is willing to pursue in that career. At a younger age, most children get encouraged by their parents to love a specific subject. Nonetheless, depending on the subject that a teenager likes, that'll most likely be the career they pursue. It may also not be the career path they choose since it differs as they grow. When you're at a young age, you tend to gather information quickly, and also learn quicker.

Parents make sure that their child not only succeeds in life, but also chooses the carrer they believe is most fit for their desire. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. It's always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Most teens would feel that their parents only wanted them to pursue in a career that they have, or from a family legacy as tradition. Nevertheless, it's always important to have a young aged teenagers opinion about their career path as well.

Teens at a young age tend to become more interested in careers more than adults. It's a fact that a teenagers brain consumes

5X

the information quicker then it would if an adult had. Being freshly exposed to a career at a young age benefits the teenager for future desires. It'll give the teenager some time to think about what careers he/she wants to get into, and how she/he is going to do it.

When there is a young aged teenager, it's best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step. For example, youtube videos upon the career, games, and movies. Every young adult would prefer some entertainment with a little bit of knowledge, and facts being thrown at them. These activities will satisfy the teenager, and It'll be the introduction to their future career path. Teenagers play an important role in today's generation. It is vital that they should have some experience or knowledge upon what career they want to obtain, and become successful in.

High school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. High schools also provide AP courses, which is an advance placement course. These courses will be a bit difficult, but will benefit the teenager of whichever career they want to achieve. It's always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how she's doing overall.

The counselor will provide him/her the best information needed to achieve the teenagers goal.

When providing options to a young age teenager, it's best that you make it seem less work as possible. Teenagers most likely wouldn't like the sound of work, and would much rather hear about electronics, or the new clothing line at hot topic. Nevertheless, it's an exquisite idea to make sure that a teenager begins choosing his/her career during high school, so they could be more accurate with it once they are old enough. It will give the brain enough time to obsorb all the information they learn, and use it for the future."
463,22F16C83DE10,"Students Summer Break Ideas

Most of students like to enjoy their summer vacation,but some educators feel like summer vacation is too long. Students and Adults decided to come up with different set of ideas to make summer break not long.. Some of the students are fine with having 2 or 3 months of summer break,and some people argue that there should be a year-round schools. A year- round school is were there would be 3- 4 week break in summer, a longer winter break,and a week off in spring and fall. These were the overall ideas that both students an Adults choose.

My personal opinion is that i would go with the year- round school because it would only take a year that students would go to school and have a shorter summer and a longer winter break. The reason why i choose this was because i prefer having a longer winter break. why? you may ask , having a longer winter break wil make students not lose a lot of school because in most part of the United States snows a lot. About 75% of parents have called in school saying that their children is sick and will not be able to go. These type of excuses can cause students lower their education and making up the work of days they haved missed. Instead of the founder of school saying their would be an ""2 hour delay"" or ""schools are close"" . Students can just stay home while having their winter break and not worrying about if they are going to school or not.

Having a shorter summer break can help bring students come back to school with a positive energy and a fresh start. Since summer break won't be long studens won't forget what they haved learned. Students are likely to fail if they would have have a really long break this is the reason why students forget what teachers haved taught them. Teenagers are likely to be more tired during the winter instead of summer this is why students are mostly tardy or absent. Even though i prefer having a shorter summer break, i still rely of the students that choose to have a longer break because it is fun to be able to go out when the weather is warm but at the same time i feel like is better having a longer break in the winter because is safer staying home when it gets really cold and when it snows.

Schools that are in the middle recontructing have to allow students take their classes out in the trailers. Even though public schools don't close when it snows a little they still have to reconsider. Some schools are constucting and students have to walk to one trailer to another to get to their class this why i like the idea of having a week off during fall and also when it's spring break ,It gets a bit cold and in some areas it already starts to snow. Having fall and spring break can bring students get their week off and take some time off before they have their SOL. It can also help refersh their brain and can start studying to be able to pass their upcoming tests.

My final conclusion is that the year-round schools sound like a good idea. It can really help students manage a lot with their education and also responsibilities. It can also help teachers not being stressed because they can also take their days off. School won't be that stressing if it were to take this idea. All of these were my own personal opinions.            "
883,442CFAE61CC3,"So we heard that our principal is going to let all the students to participate in one activity of their choice. But I have both reasons that might go alright or not. Lets just say if I agree or disagree with the principal decision and hopefully that our principal has a good feeling about this decision.

Lets start with a positive reasons. First responsibility, if the students get a activity that takes a lot of serious responsibility like for example serve on the student council or working on the yearbook, activity like that those have real responsibility to take care of. Next is not knowing it was the students talent, all activity will fill up very quickly and if any teacher puts a student that is not their favorite class they will notice that their very talented on a activity that they didn't like. Last positive reason overwhelmed, the student will get overwhelmed and sometimes is alright but at the end they still love the class.

Second, start with the negative reasons. It won't be their favorite if a student want to be a class so bad but then a teacher decides to put him/her to different class it's likely that the student wont be liking the class not a bit. Overwhelming, it's going to the same thing but the opposite its almost the same topic as the last reason of not liking the class and overwhelmed is the part cause of not liking the class which lead to our third last negative reason, dropping out its most likely that they gonna drop out the class it will get so stress and overwhelmed that the student decides to quit and that lead to have a no responsiblilty in life.

So I do agree with principal student or people need to have responsibility in life and without it theres going to be no job for that person who decided to drop of the activity they got asigned.  "
2968,D54C778A8F9C,"I think it can go both ways people can make their own decision or they can seek guidance from experts, or authorities. But its really their choice on what they want to do, it would be helpful to have an expert or authorities to help you with ideas.

People who make their own decisions on life important matters shouldnt need no help with decisions because they have it all planned out its called being responsible. Its always good to make the decisions on your own. There fore you dont need no seek guidance from other people.

People, who value self reliance is doing things on their own like homework,classwork,jobs but then they are talking about should they take guidance from experts, i would take guidance from experts because they know more. they have been there and they have experienced everything so they know how it is. I feel like doing everything on your own can be difficult and tirering and then you just feel like giving up.

In conclusion i think people should get ideas and help from experts and authorities just like i said before they have been there and they are more experienced and i feel like they can help you a lot with anything and help you be successful. "
3363,E847B658E4DA,"Is it important to express your emotions? Is it good to live a healthy life? The way you move, the way you control your movment is all up to you. Is this activity enjoyable for you?

First, this activity has been done by everyone in the world. Which is dancing, everydody at least dances once in their lives. As we speak some people take this activity to the next level. Performing at competitions or shows people pay to watch. This activity is not only enjoyable but educational for those who seek interest in dancing. There are so many things you can learn froming dancing like tap, ballet, hip pop, jazz, and ballroom dancing and more.

Second, you express your emotion, all that anger and sadness you hide, you put that into your dance its what makes it special. Do what your body tells you to do, let out whatever it is your feeling, let your emotion tell a story. Its like writing a story in a book but the only thing different is that you are moving.

Third, dancing takes alot of energy, so that means you have to have a good meal before you can dance. Streach your body so you won't pull a muscle, which can be very painful and sometimes can lead to surgery. After streaching, warm up yourself so you can build your stigma, it will help you when you are feeling weak and tired. Always drink water because you are always sweating and you need to hydrate your body.

Fourth, when you are dancing there is never a right to wrong. Its like a test with no answer key, it just keeps going without stoping. Don't doubt yourself because nobody is going to be perfect, if you want to dance like you run the world then trust yourself.

Finally if you enjoy dancing and you have passion, You are going to be unstopable. All you just have to remember is to just have fun and be you. Teach others and show them that if they are feeling alone, they are never alone because you will be right there next to them guideing them every step of the way.

In conclusion this activity is super enjoyable and fun because you will meet new people and you will have new friends and people who share the same intrest as you. Just remeber as long as you, put your mind and heart into whatever you want to do, anything is possible thats why this activity taught me so much about loving myself.        "
2513,BAD99FB704BB,"Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects.

honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings. For example ,one of Generic_Name's friends tells her something and ask Generic_Name to keep it a secret,

the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friend's secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it ,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name. Another example is that if your friend ask you if she looks good in a certain outfit , however, that is not your style and you don't like it at all , the best thing to do is to say that you like the outfit, if you tell her this , you will not hurt your friend's feelings.

One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she say that she will eat it later on. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true.

In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true.    "

1313,64EB91C84A32,"Being able to attend classes online is a dream come true. Many students miss a huge amount of school days because of personal reasons, health, or sports. However, taking a online class would resolve those issues. Students would benefit from online education because there's no reason to miss school and to work in a better environment

Whenever a student misses a day or days of school they fall behind. They then have to do extra work to get all caught up. It causes lots of students stress and sometimes failure. Weather can also cause school to cancel. For instance, snow storms, or floods but working at home doesnt cause you to miss out on school. Students can never be absent in online school because everything is on a laptop. They will always be up to date with there assignments or exams. Students don't have to worry about being late to class anymore either. Instead, students will be stress free sitting on there bed learning.

Every student would rather be at home working then to be working in a classroom. Our own homes make us feel relaxed and clam so therefore, its a safe environment to work in. We don't need to do fire drills or lock down drills in our homes because we know our homes are secure. Also, when students are focus and working on assignments, the time goes by to quick. Next thing you know the bell rings and the students havent finished the assignment yet. Working at home won't make students feel rushed at all. Instead they'll have all the time they need. Adding on to classes going by to quick, classrooms can get very loud. Unlike a classroom filled with students, your home is peaceful with no distractions.

To conclude, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. On the other hand, some students think online school isnt for visual learners but online class has many ways to educate visual learners.

Online class has video conferencing to help better understand. Online school is for every student.                         "
465,22FDAB421C71,"Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I believe that it is Imagination is more important than knowledge, because with Imagination you can Form pictures in your mind, you can create interesting ideas and fantasize about something that is exciting.

Firstly, you can form pictures in your mind. Creating pictures in your mind is useful, because you can draw pictures that is in your mind, like sketching a house that you want. You can form pictures in your mind by visualizing a situation that is interesting, like playing a game in virtual world. You can create interesting ideas that you can use to draw picture, like using a digital art to create a picture by thinking an interesting ideas. Forming pictures is really important.

Secondly, you can create interesting ideas. You can create something that will give a lot of attention like creating a fantasy book about Wizards vs witches. You can be creative by creating interesting ideas, like having a unique plans about something that is cool. You can create quotes, like

Albert Einstein did, because he had a interesting Idea about Imagination.

Creating interesting ideas is unique.

Lastly, you can fantasize about something that is exciting. Fantasizing can be exciting sometimes, because you can imagine an situation that is not real, like having a awesome superpower. You can be good at something that your not good at by fantasizing it that you can do it, like playing basketball and I also do this a lot because Im not good at studying.

You can create awesome ideas, like building a wooden car with painting on it. Fantasizing something is important as well.

I conclude that forming picture in your mind, creating interesting ideas and fantasizing about something that is exciting is more important knowledge.

In conclusion, these three reasons is why Imagination is more important than knowledge. It is my opinion that Imagination is more important than knowledge."
1675,7F21F77E9AA3,"Big Responsibility Young Age

In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? We'll figure out. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young.

Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor.

You can't know what you want to do in your life even if you haven't live by your self.

I don't think it's a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if it's your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I don't think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present.

It's hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you don't know what career you want to take it's fine you have 4 years to decide. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I

want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. And I could do better at school because I didn't have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time.

In conclusion if a student it's a really young age let them think what they want not only because it's at young age it's also because they going to pick something that it's for the rest of their life. Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they haven't discovered what life is like. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age it's with help of God."

Most workers may ask that and will be furious with technology because of the fact that they will have less work and probably less hours of work, since technology is taking over their jobs. it could also be said that technology could be taking over some jobs that require less work, which could be bad for the job environment because that means less job opportunities for people.

First, it could be rude to the staff that work their because of less human communication. How is it rude? Well think of it like this: someone is better than you at your job and you wanna be better, but you cant because the person you're going up against is a computer and knows mostly anything and everything on what to do in those situations. Most people may have to face the fact that you can't do anything about technology.

Second, The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology will have negative effects on peoples lives because of the fact that technology will help most people in some cases, but most people wouldn't appreciate the help from technology because it could be taking over their jobs and have less human contact with others. But the fact is people should appreciate technology because of what they're providing. Most people may not see it that way or feel like its helping them.

In conclusion, I believe with the reasons I have provided that technology will have a negative effect because of the way they're taking over most jobs and seeking happiness to people that enjoy it. People wouldn't like to admit the fact that technology is actually helping them and providing less work for them. Technology is actually seeking to steal most peoples jobs by doing their work for other people. I truly believe that the negative effect on technology is doing jobs for others that have the ability to do it . "
1,0022683E9EA5,"When a problem is a change you have to let it do the best on you no matter what is happening it can change your mind. sometimes you need to wake up and look what is around you because problems are the best way to change what you want to change along time ago. A

problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.

First of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after,

people may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it.

second of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and i'm not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you. For example i think that my mom and me are different because we are and i have to understand that she does not like high and i need to understand that. to help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons life.

A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand. Everyone has a different opinion and a different was to understand then others. everyone can see the different opinion and what other people think."

Many people do not done the school for different reasons for example, disscution with the parents a bad relationship parents with the sons.

Sometimes the students do not pay attention in class because in home they have a lot of problems.

The students can't concentrate because the problems between the parents affect they's life.

My life is come be hard because i do not have my parents by my size is sadness know they's far away of me.

Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point.

For instance, any project that you didnot finish can be done the next day in class, students will have enough time to ask questions about what they are being taught, they will have sufficient time to go to teachers and practice more if they have other questions related to what they were taught. This will make classes fun and more entertaining. Students will have adequate time to study and understand the concept of what they are being taught in class.

If this adaptation is considered in my school, it will cut down the usage of energy and resources. The school uses more energy and resources due to the population of the students. Some examples of such equipment that uses higher energy are as follows : Air Condition, Laptops, Printers and many others. These machines uses high barometric pressure. Throughout this four-day school week, we can conserve the energy we waste in the school.

Others may say students might get bored due to the increase in hours because they are used to the normal daily routine but hasn't considered the benefits of it. When this is taken into consideration, more energy and resources can be kept from wastage.

In summary, the four-day routine and extending of time will be beneficial to conserving energy and resources in the shool. This will make students work hard in class, reduce the work load on energy and resources, seek more help from teachers if they are finding difficulties in a particular class.

1760,857574FE9711,"In my opinion.

I agree with Emerson to be right when he wrote everyone can do eny things, but not every one wants to work hard to do.

Example.

In my personan I think to have my own helicopter in the future.

In this word evething goods is posible something more than more beyonnd whtaever my effort my or how many i give to soporting them. Even in my life or my phat way so many dificult, but I velieved in my faiht there is nothing impossible.

But i have to work hard to get them ,because nothing come easy ,everything have price first then came be true, But I can't lose nothing to try ,try and try becouse wiil be successful In the future.

Even if I see now only in my dream and, dream in my future it's already mastered.

1432,6D9728CB8711,"School should add one and a half hour to school each day. because student will get to learn more,student can get more help from teachers,also student can do more sports.

First of all,student will learn more if school board add one and a half hour to their school day. probably student will learn more because their classes will be extended. Also they can get more time in each class,so they can get more information and learn more about each subject. Also they will have the opportunity to do more activity in class. And learn how to work with others. And listen to different opinions and get to a conclusion,For example if some student are good in a activity and others are not that good. They can have the time to work as a group and explained what they are good at and what they need more help, so they all can help each other. They will also have time to work by them self. And passing there SOL.

Secondly, student can get more help from teachers. It will benefit all the student in the school, because some student need more help and different subjects. So they can have the time to go to their teachers and get some help. for example some student needs help in Math,English,civic etc. But some student are better in that subjects. So they can used one and a half hour to do another period. In that period student can go to the classes that they need more help. It will be better for some student because each student are different. And learn in a different ways . It does not mean that others are smart. It means that some student learn better in small groups. Some student learn more faster than others. Extending school it will help them get their grades up,By retaking quizzes and test and finish unfinished work. they can get help in homework too because homework is like practice,they can practice what they learn in class and get a better score in quizzes and tests

Finally,student can have the time to do more sports. With some of their schoolmates. They can have different sports. For example soccer,basketball,baseball,kickball and more sports..Student can make a vote, for what sports they will like to be in. They can learn new skills and get better by playing that sport. and get more healthy because they are playing a sport. because a big percent of student used a lot of their technology at home and don't do any sports. By extending school it can motive them,by doing some sports with their friends. They can play a lot of sports and see which sport they prefer to play,and see in which sport they are good at. They can do more activity for example Art, photographing for people that like to be creative.

In conclusion extending school it will benefit student in different ways. for example getting help from their teacher so they can get better in that subject and get good grades,Getting more time in class,They can get more information. Finally playing sports,they can be healthy and have a hobby that they like to do after all the information that they had learn during the day,some people like to do different activity like Art photographing.

543,298969937643,"I am against this issue because, it's just not a good idea for student's to graduate high school early, and enter the work force and college one year early. My reasons for this would be that, those who do graduate early will miss out on school activities. They will have to do so much preparation. Some don't see that after high school life get's tough, and who knows if they'll be able to handle it.

Early graduate's will graduate a year early, but, they don't realize that they will miss out on school activities. Some activities that excite student's would be, the school dances such as prom, and homecoming. Dance's are meant to enjoy a night with friend's, and get all dressed up for the night. Also the day before a dance, there is always a football game, which is exciting because everyone goes to support the team and if they win they celebrate the day after, which would be at the dance. Pep- rallies are when all four grade levels come together and verse each other on which class has the loudest cheer, and who has the most point's when it comes to the games they end up playing. Spirit week is also when all classes verse to win point's. To earn the point's they must dress up as the theme of that day or buy what is being sold that day. The theme's they would usually do would be twin day Monday, polka dot Tuesday, and for the sells it would be spirit chain's that get hung up. Senior activities are when all the graduate's do their last activities with those classmate's they've been knowing since elementary school. They have a senior picnic which is when only the seniors go and have lunch together. Also some go on a class trip and they take their class picture.

Even though early graduate's will miss out on school activities there's more important things than that. They might think that they are ready, but in reality they don't think about the preparation they need to face. Depending on what diploma they are headed for either the standard or advance, each diploma has its requirements for graduation. Standard diploma's really don't ask for much. There might be a chance that you won't be in need of doubling up on classes. Unlike the advance diploma it ask's for so much. An advance diploma may require you to double up due to the fact that it requires many classes. Also students won't be able to take any of those exciting elective courses that are by most the best classes a student could take. Of course the classes aren't the only thing that must be completed, there are many test's that take place. Math, science, history, and the most difficult would be the English test. They must pass each test for graduation. This would mean that, students won't have time to distract themselves' by other thing's, and, will have to stay on task to maintain their grades up. Some might say otherwise that if they're going through this road it's because they are aware and are ready.

Although graduating early excites them, it is better if they wait another year and graduate when they have to. My reason to this would be because the work force and college will be completely different than high school. High school might be the easiest part of starting to understand life. Most student's that graduate early are juniors, and are sixteen and seventeen years of age. This is pretty difficult at that age, they would have a hard time finding a decent job that will help them pay their tuition; unless they have another way of paying like a scholarship or some other way. Perhaps some might do both work and school at the same time, but, it could end up being too hard on them because they are too young and aren't as prepared as they thought. If some were to be at the age of eighteen they would have to face adult responsibilities; such as taxes, rent, insurance, and much more.

However some might think otherwise. People who favor this issue support early graduation. Their reasoning would be that it's an early start in life, and some students do it certain reason. It could be a family matter or other reasons. But, I disagree, in no way is graduating high school early good. Those student's that graduate early will miss out on so many good thing's that come with high school. They will be stressed due to so much they had to do just to get out a year early; if that didn't stress them out then having to go college and going to work to pay for their education will.  "
2935,D344D0003B84,"Every person has their own feelings, emotions, and their own talents. But people are thinking that if they that talent or skill, and they can not do that in front of the world or people. As all people has different talent, that they really want to show to people. Before they think about their talent to chance their own world, they will be so nervous that they can't do that. They will be afraid, they will not show that to people that can learn from it. That they can try it on their own life, so they can learn new thing from new people. Over 90% of all people in the world has their own talent or skills because they are being being appreciated that who are they, and by believing on their self that how hard they worked.

To begin with, one way that all people can develop their talent is by being appreciated on their self that who they are, and how they can change the world. For example, one day it was our first day that we came to America, and I even didn't know that much English that I can talk to person. So one year later I learn some English, and I got to 8 grade, by other day we were going to do the student let decision. I really did not talk that much because I was so nervous about it like how I have to talk in front all the teachers, and students. I wanted to try it but I couldn't do that. This evidence shows that, being in different country and not knowing their language is really hard. My mom, and dad was always trying so hard that one day I will be able to speak English. My mom, and dad were always telling me that ""always be appreciated that how you got to this level, and think about hoe you can make different talents that people can see, so they can improve it on their life."" After that day I told to my self "" I always will be able to be appreciated to my self, and by being in this world."" As always that one day I will show my talent to people that I never thought of that one day I will learn English too. clearly, if I wasn't being appreciated to my self, to my teachers, to my family that they were working with me together. I wasn't be able to even write this essay. now even if I am not that much perfect I am happy that I got to that point that I and my family really wanted.

In addition, there is other way that you can show your talent to people by believing in your self that you can get to your goal by working hard as much as you can do it, and as much as possible. So you can see the result of it by your working hard. For Example, my brother Generic_Name, he is in 12 grade, for him it was really hard because he was always worrying about his grades, and he was saying ""how I can get to finish my

12 grade by being a perfect student. He was always wondering about his self, and that how hard will be next year.

One day my mom, and dad told him that ""if you believe in your self, by that time you already got this."" this evidence shows that,

Generic_Name couldn't believe on his self. Generic_Name wanted to know that how he can show his own talent . He was always worked hard to improve in his new talents or skills. Now he got to finish his 12 grade by being successful. By next year he will go to collage. Clearly, if Generic_Name didn't listen to my mom, and dad he wasn't able to finish his 12 grade by showing to all of his teacher that how he improved om his talents.

In conclusion, developing your talent or skill is a different way or different thing that you can bring it into your own life. By being appreciated and believing in your self that change your life, and bringing a smile up on your family face. As always people want to develop new talent to their own life to make them change, different, and happy. Clearly, being in a different country, far from your own family, And you can't see them. It's really hard for everyone especially me with my family. But I got a strong talent that no one can pull me back from it. For bring appreciated to my have that they were working together with me that I can get to this part. Today I realize that how much I improving in own life, in writing, and speaking English. Even if not that much perfect. And like Generic_Name, he believe on his self, and he worked hard that he got to that point. Now he is working hard that he can make this world a better place for his future that is coming up. Clearly, if you want to improve in your own life or in you own talent or skill that is in your heart, and that can show your develop to the people for this world, and it will be applying to your own goals. Always be thankful, be appreciated to your family, teacher that they worked hard for you to learn new things that will persuade you to your new goals. As everyone has a talent to the world, And that way they can change the world too. Always work hard in your life if you want to develop your talent. By improving a skill can make your own place, and your own world beautiful as they can see the result of it at the end.  "
1535,760988C4BA3B,"In the future, I hope that one day I will win a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament. Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. I know that I can't just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life.

""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if we've gotten tired of doing other activities together, we've never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because it's a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I won't have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament.

""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you don't get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldn't do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others.

My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. I've always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it. It also sounds great when you get paid to do something you love like competing in tournaments. I learned that doing activities are never as fun when you're doing it alone. ""Super Smash Brothers"" brings others closer together with their families and friends."
3424,EAEE04B1F712,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree, why do I agree with scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination,

you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

First, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how it's. Your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called Fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how it's going to look like. In knowledge you just know it you can't make it more beautiful. When you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. That's why imagination is more important than knowledge.

Furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. I can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. You need imagination more than knowledge. I am not going to say you can't build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. Imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. In knowledge it's like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question.

Finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. Well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. If we don't use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. If you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than you're making your life better and the world a better place.

To conclude, scientist Albert Einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge ."" and here is why with imagination you can create in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it. If you can imagine something than you do it if you imagined it right. "
3647,F55F4FD90B3C,"Some schools used cell phone during classroom because for educational purposes. If students doesn't used cell phone during class, how can students find information about the assignment. Some school doesn't allow students to used cell phone because the teachers says that students can find the information in books. Students says that by using cell phone is much easier to find information than in books.

Some teachers allow students to use cell phone during class so that students can find information easier. If students used books, some of the students can't even find the information that the students needed. for example, students that used cell phone is more likely to finish earlier than students that using books. in additions, Cell phone have more information than book. So, teachers should allow students to used cell phone during class for educational purposes.

Schools should allow the students to used cell phone in the class, so that students can work much faster and easier. If schools doesn't allow the students used phone in the class, some students going to have a hard time to work and students is going to take to much time on the assignment. Lots of students prefer cell phone because it much easier to find information. If students used books, students will take time to go back and forth and find the information that the students needed. Schools should allow the students to used cell phone in the class.

Technology is getting efficient and faster, so schools should let students used the technology so that students can get more information and can search any assignment that students need. Technology is adding new stuff every day, so that the students can learn something new every day. If students used the technology, students can get smarter and technology will improve every day. If students used books, students will never learn new things and students will have the same information. Schools should let the students use the technology so that the students will have more knowledge.

In conclusion, Teachers should not keep giving students books to study because students will never learn new thing in life. In addition, school should let students used technology in the classroom so that students will undertand technology and new information. Schools should improve the technology for the students, so that students can work faster. Technology will improve and students will get smarter, so that shools will provide technology for students."
2948,D3D5841674F5,"Technology has positive effects on people's lives because they can help you with many information that your trying to look up for example if your trying to shop, play games, or even buy or read books. They help you do a lot when you really need it. Technology is not for only buying or doing any other things it's for doing projects in class or a if your doing your homework, applying for jobs, and applying for college. Here are my 3 reasons why technology is positive for people's lives.

First, let's say that you want to go to college but you can't go to the college because you don't have time or maybe that you just can't go. What you can do is that you can go on your laptop and go to the website and apply there and you can take your time on it and not have to worry about going there. You can apply to many collleges online and that is really great so you can get accepted to many colleges out in other countries or states. When my brother was in 12th grade he wanted to go personaly to the colleges but he said some of them were too far and that he didnt want to go because he needed to do something really important and so what he did was that he went online and started applying for 5 colleges and he got accepted to 4 of them. He said it was not even hard. Having to fill papers with people takes up so much time that you will be there the whole day instead of you doing it online at home and not having to rush up anything and if you mess up the laptop tells you that there is something that you typed up is wrong.

Second, If you don't feel like going to the store because your just tired and you just don't want to go out but you need some clothes for that night and you don't have any then what you can do is go online and start shopping there and buy everything you need for that night and you will be fine with out the need of going to the mall or going to any other store. At the same time even tho your not going out if you shop online there is a posibility that your clothes that you ordered does not fit you or it might not come on time when you really need it. The process of returing it and everythig is just too much. That's why people prefer that it's better to go to the store and just buy it from there. If that was me I would prefer to go to the mall or the store to. When you go to the stores sometimes you have to handle some workers that are aggressive and they have a bad attitude. I don't like seeing people with bad attitude it makes me mad and it always makes me just go away and not look at them anymore.

Third, In school sometimes you have projects and you have class work but you can't find information about your research or anything about your topic or about your class work then you have to find information online. When you ask your teachers what they would say is that go on your laptop and look it up and then go ask your classmates if you can't find anything. For my US VA History project are teachers gave us many different websites that we can use and they were very helpful I got all my information from there. I didn't even have to go ask him for help or anything. Also when you have test it's mostly technology because you don't really have test on paper anymore now it's on laptops and you don't have to write anything now it's only typed it is really easy and fast. Even essays it used to be essays on paper and now it's essays in laptops.

In conclusion, These were my 3 main reasons why technology has a positive effect on people's lives. There can be many positive effects on technology but theses 3 were mostly about how technology is even tho you do not interact with other humans face-to-face it is good doing online things. There are better chances that you get many things done and also you get the chance to have some time off of looking and talking to people. If I were to ask many people which side they prefer they would choose the positive effect side. ""It's better technology instead of talking to people""."
3245,E2456BDC6648,"Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school's building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don't live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people.

To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged.

Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. That's one of the best ways to conserve cars' energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas.

Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that don't have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well.

Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. Firstly: conserving energy light and food and saving gas and money, having extra time for work, friends and most important: Family."
2416,B385E5EE33B9,"If you ever get a chance to go on vacation, it should be the Bahamas. The Bahamas will blow your mind away. The Bahamas will have everything you want to see. It will also be the best place you've ever go to in your life.

You would want to go to the Bahamas because the beach is crystal clear. You can see all the baby fish that are swimming around you which is so cool! I always try to catch one but it never works. There will also be very colorful snails stuck on the rocks. They look poisonous so I never try to touch them. You can also go surfing there. I am too scared to surf so I just lay down on the surf board and relax. There are coconut trees near the beach which looks really cool. One of my favorite parts is when big boats pass by and big waves come your way.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because the restraints there are like no other restraints here. The restraints there look big and fancy. The best part is that you get to eat at a restraint for every meal because there is no store there for you to buy food and cook it up. Although that may be a little expensive, but you have to keep in mind that you are on vacation. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes for them to serve your food. I don't know about you, but to me that is not long at all. The food taste so good! They also never over cook your food too! One of my favorite dishes is the shrimp pasta. If you go to the bathroom it is super clean and it smells good too. I hate it when I go in a bathroom that is dirty and smells bad.

Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because of the awesome, clean, and fancy hotels there. The hotels there are nice and refreshing. It is super clean. There are two closets, two beds, and one bathroom which is pretty good if you ask me. There is also a big TV right in front of the two beds. There is also free WiFi for you to use but that is kinda unless when you have a big TV right in front of you unless if you want to play games on your phone which is what I do. There is also a mini fridge for you to put your water so when your hot just grab the icy cold water out of the fridge to drink. The best part is that there is air conditioning and it actually works.

These are all the reasons why you should go to the Bahamas. All I am trying to say is that the Bahamas is a great place to visit with your family and friends. If you ever get a chance to go on vacation, go to the Bahamas and you won't regret it."
3063,DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes.

I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house it's worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable.

You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didn't call anyone else for help due to the fact they we're new in the city and didn't knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better.

During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldn't had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like i'm being rushed and I can't concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time.

Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and there's noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you weren't able to finished due to curfew. Think about many other things that can be done, other things that can help others."
3617,F40D707EC722,"We all have our own goals that we would like to accomplish in the future. Perhaps you still want the same thing as when you were a kid, maybe the technology has changed your plans. I personally want my dream to go to college accomplished by the future, get a career, high education, be the first one in my family that has gone to college.

First of all going to college can help me get the career I want which is game designing. game designing is a career I have wanted to get since I turned twelve years old when I first started playing minecraft. Minecfrat is an awesome game where you can build really cool things that come out of your mind, yo may create a whole new entire world in there. When I turned twelve I always wonder how did they make games go so real so I started reading articles, books, etc. then I stared playing more games and it was incredible. I want to go to college and be able to make my own games because I know people would love playing them. I want to make my own gaming company and kids going around talking about my games. but the only way I can actually do that is by having a college career.

My second reason why I want to go to college is because the majority of people in the United States just drop out of high school. People who dropped out of high school have a really low education degree. I personally want people to think I am smart just by looking at my education record. If u completed your goal in college, if you graduate, people would offer really good jobs to you with a high salary only because your education is high and you know what your doing because they've taught you that in college.

Last but not least I want to be the first one in my family that has actually gone, completed, and graduate out of college. My family is not poor nor is rich we are in the middle class, which I understand why some of my family could not actually afford to go to college. but some people in my family had has the opportunity and they just din't wanted to go because they wanted to live the life, was they're excuse but living the life is not working at a pizza place or McDonald's. I want to demonstrate to all my family, who actually had the opportunity of going to college and din't, that the way they think living the life is wrong. I want them to see that even going to college you can still live the life and probably even better when you have actually graduate. I want for my two little brothers to see, to be proud of their sister and be a good role model for them, so they can follow my steps and get a good live.

We all have our goals that we would like to accomplished in the future. maybe when you grow up you are just going to change plans and do something more important. I want to go to college so I can get a career, I want to go to college so i have a high education degree, I want to go to college to be a good role model to my little brothers and kids in general. going to college is just a really important thing in your live that some people dont get the opportunity to do and some do."
3524,EFDAD69E103B,"I have being asked to explain the effects of a program involving pairing, older students , and younger students.

Some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. I think that a program like that will be helpful. The older students are available to assist the younger students.

This program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. Also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be sucessful.

Like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills the've learned in school, or somewhere else. Or maybe how they've learned to play baseball or softball.

The older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike.

Helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. Or sometimes bad.

Like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. It is free and not obligatory. So me and some of my friends, joined that club. And also some othe r students. Some of the older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. Every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. That club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. Me and my friends also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time.

In conclusion, pairing older students , with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need.

Being kind an cooperating is the best thing to do while being in a club or working with younger and older students."
871,42DB5DABA590,"That older students can assist with the younger students and the younger students can pair up with the older students. I think this way because the older students can help with the subjects of the younger student that dose not know about. And that the older student can learn something about the younger student that he/she does not know about ether. To have more understanding of the old and young student. And to work together as one.

The older students have know the past year before the young. They know about the subjects they did and know what to do. This can help the young because when it comes to questions, they can do something about it. They can give examples of what troubles them when it comes to a hard question. To show what feels how hard or easy in class, projects, work, and homework can be.

The younger students has a fresh start to 5th grade to middle school or 8th to freshmen. Other students think that middle or high will be easy. Or other think that it will be hard for them self. To open up lockers, find there classes, etc. But by the older students can help them what works best for the student. They can understand of what to do in class. Because of the help of the older students. And they can also teach the other young students of the teaching of the older students.

The program can help each other by if they want to be helpful and to work the path to be more easier Maybe something won't be east on work in school. If the student wants to ask questions, to show hints, or how its going to be in the next grade. The program can make everything much more simple. And this is why that the program can help with the younger students and the older students can know something about the student."
2432,B4B82E063D04,is setting an good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people or are there better ways too influence others my opinion is that setting a good example can influence other people around you why because if they see you do something good they might catch on and say oh since he was being nice im start doing the same thing and start doing good deeds and that will help others because than people will start catching on and start being to nice to everyone. your setting example for the younger kids because most of the kids look up to there older siblings saying when i grow up i want to be like them so setting an example for the youth or anybody is great. it also helps with safety too if there was something going down like a robbery or a shooting adults will probaly try yo protect the younger kids and than when some adults see some kids by themeselves they will see other adults and run to protect more kids. and if your in school and you went to class and show up on time teachers can use you as an example for coming in on time being ready to do your work and people will look up tp that and say i want my teacher to use me as an example and start doing the same thing they'll be on time and ready to do there work.

Daily we live the way we want to. But, sometimes we don't consider the important things that can make us success in life. Attitude can be one of those facts that can make us success. There are some specific reasons about the importance of attitude and why we should consider this or not a fact to success in life.

Although some people thinks that working alone is more beneficial, working with a group is more successful because it would be easier to ask for help and to succeed in life.

Some people thinks that working alone is more successful. It gives people time to plan and easier to make good efforts.

1160,59981B992996,"My first paragraph is , I think that some schools offer distance learning, for students because if they dont want to attend to school in the morning ; for example they can take that classes online, the classes that they miss the day they are out of the school . Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because if they are in High School and if they are in 12 grade , and they need some classes to pass they can take online that classes . Because if they dont pass that classes they are going to lose the year in High School , and all the students they are not going to graduated.

My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school. For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know.

If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but; if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes.

That school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet . For example , if you at home don't have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes that's why the school's give you that option to you and for all the student's if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.

1317,6521895BA018,"One time, my friend used all type of drogas for example: cocaine, marihuna, ciggarett,alcohol,etc. But one day he asked me what school am i going? i said Generic_School, can i go with you? he asked me, of course i said. I am tired to use all this drogas, i want to be something else in my life. Since this moment he chenged his life. Now he wanna be a doctor for to help people to become a some else in their life. I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment.

I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse.

Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment.

Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

In conclusion, work individuality is not easy i have

To showto the people that sometime we do not need help from somebody else. Just believe in myself, do not heard what they said about me, to show them what is the defference between to make then to talk and all time to be concentration in what i am doing. Thus i something else is the greatest accomplishment. ""The world needs me"". if "

Technology allow poeple to complete many task without having contact with others. Technology have a negative effect in people life because people life is passing in front of their face without knowing, technology hurts people in many ways,and make many people to feel bad with themself.

Some people think that technology is the best creation that the human ever made because entertain and hepl people to understand many things. Others believe that technology is a easy way to make assigments because google have every kind of information. Still other argue that without technology this world would not be the same because doctors would never find the tratment for the sickness.

Technology have a negative effect in people life because they forget to live their life and the time is passing, just because they spend all their time playing video games, in the phone, and they star to getting older and because the years are passing like nothing and really fast that when they react they would see that their best years just passing, without enjoy their time with the people that they love. Many people just react only when one family member death and they start to think that life is too short, and it is why people need to apreciate and enjoy,

learn new thing, meet new places, have more experiences, and also meet new people and learn good thing from them.

Many people hurt them self in many ways for example physical and mental because physical they star to get fat and then they do not take care about their healty and if they do not take care who else would do for them, because when they star to get sick they just do not care about it, because they want to keep concentrate in their video games or telephone. metal many people just not care about their future and goals, because they are really busy thinking how to get the most advance technology device and who is usining in where they go. many people do not take care about their personal life and after few years later when the affected would be them because they did not care about their future they would have nothing and the technnology every year change, and get new devices. People need to think about what is most important something else that is really important and needed or a device that in few months would be betters phone and other devices, because for example whe a phone just come out every one want to buy and the price is more than $1000 and after few monts the price is more lower and they have another new phone, it is in what people want to spend money and time, first think and later act after they know is the best.

Technology makes people to feel bad about themselves because now people believe everything that is posted in internet, only because some people said it ect. Other make their self look better in the phone and when they look their self in the mirror they hate their self, and sometimes people look other people in internet that they post picture they want to be like them and they star to despreviate their self and start to search in google how to change or do something they can not do it or does not work they get depress, stressful and tired of their life that sime search the easy way, that many people and doing in other country that is kill their self, so technology just affect people in many ways.

Technology affect people in a negative way because people spend too much time on techonology and life is just passing. Technology is taking over people, and into they get hurt with something or someone that they love they start to see that they was doing wrong, they get dissapoinment with themselves for being so stuped, people need to use less phone and spend more time with family and enjoy every second of life because life is just one and is really short.

People consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success have motivation to do new ideas even if they can not do it. They push them self to keep trying because it makes them stronger as a hum being. Being enthusiastic makes you confident, in want to do more thing's in life. people push them self on being enthusiastic, it makes them excited on being confident in them self. More you try the more you want to get interest in exploring.

Having enthusiasm makes you happy it only gives you have positive thoughts. There are great people in the world that will give you advice. Telling you that you can do it if you only put your heart into it you can get it. Even if you fail always keep trying, you most likely would not get it the first time. Seeing other people on their success makes you have enthusiasm and make you uncomplash your own dreams.

Now in days their are people that expect if they try on doing something once they can not succeed again. Humans' relay on other's for their own achievement. Not having motivation makes you not want to do anything and you will keep failing. If you fail and fail, feel sad and give up you can become depressed. As you stop putting in effort in things you lose interest and do not try.

Failure is what makes you strong so you do not give up on trying. Failing is what should push you to make improvement and know your strength. Tell yourself to always think positive never negative you should have enthusiasm because that is what makes you stronger. Who you are is how you make of it and having interest on new things makes you a believer in yourself.

3098,DBC04530D2F9,"Have your ever ask yourself what makes a person's character?. Some People think that a person's character is define by their actions and by what their selves choose to. While others think that character is form by influences beyond control. I agree that as individuals our character is influenced beyond our control because of , internet influence, fit in society , and by actions.

One reason why character is influence beyond control is because people get influenced by internet platforms. Internet platforms in influence in many ways some could be good , while other not quit so. Character is influence by social medias posts , YouTube videos and variables of things. These kind of things interfere with a person characteristic people might want to follow and do what they see on internet. a person might not even be awarded that they are being influence by internet.

second claim why a person's character is influence beyond control is because they get influence by society. People might feel that to fin in society they have to have the same characteristics and act the same as others to be accepted and tolerated by society. People who is pressure by others would act and do things that they know are no specifically good. For example you are a very respectful and kind person but they you turn into a not so kind person their has to be something making you changed the way you are and that could be other people , changing your character.

Lastly people's characteristics are influence beyond control because of the actions they take in life.

People's actions influenced the way they are and act. By taking good actions your character will be defined in a positive and understandable way. good actions will be the key into having authentic and unique character.

In conclusion there are many factors that influence that a person's character.

People some often get their way of acting and doing thinks from internet platforms which could be something bad it's not take with careful. Today,s society can have a big impact in everyone's lives, we are living in a time were people would do whatever takes to fit in and feel like think they are part of society, but sometimes being around people is not mentally healthy. Actions are a big part a person,s characteristics because your character will depend on actions."
1052,50611B996992,"During this time our society are magnifying in many ways. Therefore, people has to work, study, or do any personal things every day. People don't conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades.

To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they don't have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students.

Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy.

Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student. Likewise, that all students do their homework and be on time in their class. nevertheless, the majority of the students has problem be on time or do homework some of them miss school days just because they didn't do their homework. Altogether, durin this days off students can do their homework with resources, patience and dedication. After all, this could help student to have better grades.

To conclude, the priority for people life is to conserve energy and resouces. Rather, we are on time to help our students's health. Lately, doing different rutine will help us to progress and be healthy. If we are healthy we are less stressful we will be with energy.

I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us.

The first reason is because the parents of the students won't have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food.

My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain won't function good though the whole day. Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day.

My last reason, is that the student won't be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier.

This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school. "
2429,B4994C771190,"Do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. First, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. For example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. Next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day. Finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. For example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. That's why I think is nice to get classes at school and I think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget.

In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything.

1550,770E1717845C,"In life, their is ups and downs. you can live you're best life and still fail at times. Failure teaches most people lessons. People also don't care at all. Although, failure can also bring success, if you move smart. Yes, I agree with Prime Minister Churchill with this statement, it all adds up. This all depends on you're level of enthusiasm. How you can handle failure and just grow, learn from mistakes. Failure can bring success.

In life their is ups and downs. Nothing wrong with that at all. For example, you try so hard at something and still fail. All you can do is too learn and grow from that mistake. This just how life goes. When you have are down bad, just pick yourself up and move forward. Positive attitudes will help a lot. Failure teaches people lessons also.

If you're trying, working hard you are leading yourself to success, you could probably fail at times. Failure is part of life is my point. Growing and learning from mistakes help a lot for most people. With good enthusiasm, leads to a good path and positive mindset. Learning from mistakes can or will lead to success, just depends on your'e next actions and command.

This is a important topic , because who doesn't want to be successful in life. Being positive can help a lot. For example, people that have negative attitudes can lead to bad mindsets, we don't want that from you, unless you want that. The things or people you are around may cause a bad or good mindset. This all depends on how you approach things and act. Positive actions, thoughts, people will help you learn many stuff.

Failure is an important roll in life. It brings success. It doesn't feel too good to fail, It just how things goes. Nothing wrong with failing, its all about learning from mistakes. Failure plays the roll of life and success. Even the small can lead you to success in many ways. For example , you can fail at school, home, at anything, just pick yourself up and move forward. It isn't easy but it is worth the weight on your life.

Failure is a big word, so is success. Their are many ways you can lead to success. Without loss of enthusiasm and good attitude brings you to a real world. You can fail and still succeed thats the important part. Not give up is also a good solution. Positive surroundings, small things, full enthusiasm , you will be on the right path. Their will be ups and downs, you should understand that. Learning from mistakes is most important role of success, it helps you grow better and in a positive way. Yes failure can lead to success.       "
720,3766B7A3A5E0,"There are many different ways to look at this statement. Even though Mr Lubbock does make an excellent point in his argument I do not support it. I believe that our characteristic traits have a lot to do with the people that we choose to surround ourselves with. We have all been influenced in a certain way by someone. Whether if that was being convinced into doing something that we didn't want to do or if it we were given a confidence boost to tackle the challenge ahead of us.

There have been many cases where someone gets into a lot of trouble by doing something that they didnt want to do. They were brainwashed into doing what everyone around them told them to do because they were the people who they truly trusted. But in the end they where just let down by them. For example there are many known cases where some innocent teenager gets a drug addiction because they were influenced to do them by the people who they were surrounding themselves with. This one poor decision has now changed that persons entire life by someone who they probably wont even remember their name in ten years. They wont get the opportunity to play in any sports teams because of their current state. People will look down on them because of what they have done in the past. They wont get the same job opportunities as other people because of their mental and physical state.

Because of this we should be able to love ourselves the way we are and we shouldnt need the influence of people around us to shape our lives, we should be forward and honest with people, if you dont want to do something they that are telling you to do you need to build up your confidence and tell them that you wont get involved in such a thing.

Does this mean that you will loose a couple friendships? Sure but at least you did what was right and you were able to take control over your life and make what you think are the right decisions. Now that person is probably going to get into a lot of trouble by what they have done but you wont because you were able to take matter into your own hands and do what was right for your future.

In conclusion take control over your own life and dont do what everyone tells you to do. Go with your instinct and if you believe that something is wrong then dont do it because it might change your future for ever for the better or for the worst. "
2346,AE2E6B3472DB,"A Former British Man a Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ''

success consists of going from failure to failure wi t hout loss of enthusiasm

.''

is like saying that people are more afraid of success that they're are in failure. what Winston is talking about that is okay to lose once in awhile as long you have that smile in your face that you already a winner of yourself, like playing a soccer game but your team loses but you lose as a team, failing a quiz you just gotta do better in the retake you can't give up on something that is precious to you. People make mistake and people learn from it just try to do better next so you can succeed on winning. Some people are scared to take the chance to succeed because that taking a risk of failure and people have but you won't know if you try. Winston Churhill want people to never give up on your dream. if you learn more about the subject you won't got no worried about a thing. Once I was little I have a hard time learning and participating in class that my mother and father didn't knew about the time that they constant working to provide us a house,food,and clothes. I have to restart kindergarten because of my failure that I didn't bother asking my mother about was my mom knew about they took me to a doctor to check on me that I have a learning factor my mother was worried that I have to transfer every school that have a program for me then there was one school that help me learn better communicate with teacher answering question when I first started highschool I look back when I was little and started to laugh and think I have so many chances to succeed in life that one day I'll go back to the teacher and say thank you for everything so I have to go through of failing but never lose my hope of becoming a winner. "
2254,A8DFA8766B31,"I think for my opinion students should and shouldn't use their phones at school. because the good thing about it is faster and its easier because students now days use their phones every day. The bad things about students using their phones in class its that it could be a distraction for them doing their work and many more things.

The bad things about students using their phones are that students wouldn't pay attention in class and would be lazy to do their work at school, thats why the schools have computers and a library's so we could look up information for their subjects. Its a distraction and wouldn't let them learn or do their work. cause now in these days all teenagers use their phone for everything. Lets say if the teacher let the students use their phone so they can look up information for their work. Im pretty sure mostly of the students would be doing something is like being on social media or texting their friends. Thats why school is a place to get your education by learning and paying attention.

Even students now this days they get mad if the teacher ask for their phone cause they use it allot in class. Students learn more faster by reading n doing their work and using their head. Cause if they use their phone they going to be looking up the answers. I think what should teachers do is that they should give their phone to the teacher once you get into class and once the class ends he should give it to you back. Another bad things about phones is that they use them on the test to look up the answers n dont try.

The good things about using your phones is that it easier to use then a computer and it so much faster. I think students should be allowed cause you could learn from their n look up information or things that you dont understand in class and you could find another way of learning and different ideas. The other good reason your better on typing on phone then using computer.

I think its a good and a bad idea cause with your phone its quicker to use then a computer but the bad thing about its a distraction to student. Cause they would putting more attention to their instead of the teacher. And student get distract with their phone cause they access to social media at the same time. And student would cheating on test cause they would be looking up the answers. Students now in this days have to use their phones less cause they use them every day n not their and thats the reason they dont learn."
1943,92D03AB56C53,"Failure the Success of Life

Winston Churchill was a British Minister.

He was a writer famous for his phrase that he ussually used.

Once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

I belive, that failure is an important element that plays in the persuit of success, because the failure lead to succes, failure is unavoidable, learn from your mistakes, and the failures often leads to problems.

One reason is the success that consist of going from failure to failre without loss the enthusiasm.

Failure is unavaidable, the path of success is not a straight on.

Every people have to fails sometimes in the life, but that is part of the life.

For example sometimes, invest money in some bussiness, but we don't know if go to win a lot money, or lost all the money or just one part of money.

If for some reason we fails, doesn't matter, we need to try again, maybe that would be the success to have your company owner. Never say not, before try it.

Another reason, is to learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistakes at least you know, not to do it again.

A failure might put end thing idea or opportunity, but lead you others.

If you ready failure and you know what was the mistakes try to find a solution, and not come back with the same ideas, you need to learn for each mistakes.

For example, if I say something wrong, like English word, if somebody heard me and corrigir me, I try to not say that word again.

One more reason, failure often leads to problem, we need to solve our problems and getting throught difficul times makes you smarter and stronger as a person.

By dealing with your failures you will to be prepared and have most experienced in the future.

If you know that to fails before, so you are somebody with most experience in the life, you know that if you have a important roll in your work, that is why you to fails in some time, but you need always to continue ahead.

Everyone have differents kind of problems, but each problem have solution.

If for find solution is possible that we go to fails, just doing that, we need to solve each problem without doesn't matter what come ahead we always want the success.

In conclusion, failure can change who you are, and what path you're on the life.

To fails in our life is something that cannot to avoid, but we not wanted to be a failure always, we want to change and have success. Each mistakes is a success more in our life, I think that failure it plays an important role in the persuit for the success. We need to pass for differents path and in each one, we go to learn new things.

Mistakes only makes smartes, and working to solve problem only makes us strongen."
521,27D80E5F87B1,"Which is better Working with a group or working alone, Somepeople may say working in a group is more Beneficial than working all alone. By

Sharing answers, Help each other if stuck in proplem, and get to finish on Time

.

First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to thing about because I,m not that good in English speaking, For example i got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time i finish reading i ask my tracher if i could let Generic_Name to be my partner so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a diffrent thoughts of each one of us,

Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because Its fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challege in a computer so we could learn and do fun in the same time.

Third, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone. Because Students could finish their work on time, Foe Example Last week me and Generic_Name we got a project is Due in two day in History class, We worked together and reachers a diffrent thing and write a diffrents thought and even diffrent answers and we compond all of our answers and finish on time with diffrents thoughts.

Conclution, Some people may say Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, But Sometime i like to work a lone because i could think of my answers and question and even could get my own grade but sometimes when i work in a group when i try to work and care about my work but the rest of my grop does not care so if no body has worked then the hole group will get a zero even the person who worked."
531,286FE6743E88,"The constantly tying to do make something else is the greatest accomplishment.

I thinks for this that is the very better idea, I am agree because when you do somethings. When you doing somethings may be this can helping for another person that is great for all the time. This support we can something better because you know make some great this can effect for some people,and can i'm disagree,for example when yo doing some helped to hospital may be can bring some support with you pay 20 dollar for month. This helped to hospital is something you know about a greatest accomplishment because you do this idea about yourself.

That is contantly trying of yoursel. This is always and without interruption or can be again and again without end, and me position this issue is real education, so you do somethinmg in then you have you doing a discussion. When you has something to doing, then we have to do a discussion about what is the greatest accomplisment this that happened because we have to do something individuality, and make a support, for example we have to make some better we know about this how the education is the great discusssion because everybody have to making a reasons and bring the support, and this position I am agree beccause when you spoke about of the education for all the children the is some sure.

The greatest accomplishmnet can be something bad you can reporting a situation. for this things you do some this is for yourserf because you make some can have a discussion, and you making the be better accomplishment or laern more about for this experienced. For instance what is right of accomplishment is the we tying to make something such as a blessing somebody the is the greatest accomplishment because you making very good for some people this is agree,and the is action you doing and support because you make is good reasons. Also for some specific example about is the a greatest accomplishment is when all the people in a country are developed the is of better accomplishment because the people of for this country to make a dicussion, trying,talent for that country can be developed. Also something accomplishment we trying to be better because sometime is so difficulty to do here is we have to used the talents for support the idea for develop.

Sometime of the talented is having to be more considerable because we have to do a particular effort, and support this position on this issue. I feel the position when tying to make about something right you are make some greatest accmplishment agree because we trying helped and then make a reasons specific next doing a discussion and desiccion.

I make every day to be more better for any class. and tying to helped ssome people this is a constantly that make, when trying to make something is so difficult because I has to make a discussion but for a dicussion all have to talent this is statement about individuality to making. However i has to used the talent. Also in the life and future all the people have to make bigger greatest accomplishment this is that people can be more great life.

The greatest accomplishment somethings factor that have in the life. Also may be can sometnhing has to resolver with a discussion. Also this thing have to be the greatest because we trying to some to do and support.

1979,95FD6DF25420,"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses.

Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money.

Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked

4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days.

Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more.

There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours.

In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it .               "
3201,E0A8EBEE657B,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. Yes, I agree based on my own experience for me first impression is important. Because of how I see someone and feel someone by their energy.

For example I met my best friend other friend, the first time I saw her other friend I instantly like her. She was so sweet always giving me a good energy that I want for a person. She was so kind and love to smile, and she dress neatly. Her smile effect me she makes want to me smile, from that moment on I know that her and I could get a long.

Another example my seatmate, my first impression about him was a good one. Because he was just calm and his attitude is the same as mine. I see myself in him, him and I just get along well and his giving a good energy that I like for a person.

Another example first day of our club meeting, my club teacher paired me to someone that I don't know, For us to know who are other club members are to know each other. My first impression about her was not good, because she did not talk to me when I tried to talk to her. She gives me a bad energy that I don't like to a person.

Some people might disagree with me that first impressions are almost impossible to change, and some people might agree with me. I agree, because first impression are important to me it helps me to know instantly if I like the person that I just met or not. Some people might say or think that first impression does not matter, because you should know the person you just met more. Before you decide that when ever you like that person or not. And I would agree to that, but for me first impression are almost impossible to change, for my own opinion."
2868,D01F88C1F2A0,"I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change, people can have different impression and different changes no one has the same attitude as others

.Sometimes they don't even change because they don't care about it, and some of the people they get altered on something or on someone, it's based on what experiences people already had .

Some people don't even change when they have their first impression because they don't even care about it and people can change when they really give them a bad impression about them. Sometimes they keep doing the same thing every day and they don't even care about other people who are talking about them. But when they get another impression they start to think on what they did wrong and they analyze it. People start to change when they really need to change who they are. And to change takes time some people don't change quickly because they can commit the same thing without thinking it.

People can get impress on relationship about betraying each other, they can get altered on something or on someone . In a relationship their are always going to have problems it could be jealous, toxic, and bad influence. Many adolescents are dying just because they give them a impression about her/his boyfriend betraying them with another one and they don't even think about how hard is goig to be to that person knowing that they betraying them in that moment. Being on a relationship is not to impress others that they can get jealous at, sometimes changing is hard but it's a good way to have a good relationship.

In my experience, when I had my first impression I think that it was impossible for me to change myself. In that moment when they told me that I was a girl who disappointed other people about my attitude, I really feel very disappointed in me that I think negative everyday. And that I can not do what other people are good at. It was impossible for me to change my attitude because I was use to things that it was good for me but for others was not. So one day I say that I was going to change who I'm no matter how hard it was but it was going to be possible for me to change with or without help.

I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change. changing is a good way to show to everyone that you are not the same person you use to be, and that every impression that they going to give you is going to be a way to try and to not commit the same thing in the future. People can say that it's impossible to forgot what we did in the past but when we try every day to forget it, we can get better to it. Everyone are not perfect but we can get better at changing our attitude on not trusting people who we think that it's not the kind of people were are going to trust.           "
2118,9EB5AA842FEF,"Many student's take districts offer programs because , They think that is more easy . School's maybe is easy ,if student's going to school only three years . Also, some parents maybe are agree with that . if student's go three years to school . the students parents spend a little money in their . Also, student's can work early and get their own money. Especially , if school during three years. but, definitely , many student's take the longer way in high school . that's the mean. the four years.

Also student's choose this districts offer programs to graduated quickly from high school and work . for example , my friend take districts offer programs and he is graduated rigth now. but, he spend all his time only studing and him have his diploma and him is working. but, i'm taking the four years in school ,not only ... but also, obviously , i'm learning more . because , i spend more time in school. Clearly students wants to graduated from high school , that's why they take this programs . and some student's choose this programs because , they want go to the collage . and want to meet their dream.

I understand that many student's wants to graduated quickly and get their diplomas . but take the four years in high school is better than districts offer program . because , student's who take this programs are grieve and

, obviously , their are very busy and extressed . because they don't have time . They only pass all days , evening and summer studing , but student's who take the four years are fresh of the mind and they have time for studing and work at the same time. and can spend time for their friend and family, thats why four years in high school is bettter than three years. Definitely , some students prefert districts offer programs. but they kill their own self . because they pass studing ans studing. their many students like studing alot , but its importantly, that they safe their health ."
1856,8BE20A3524AE,"Students should commit to a career at a young age or specifically by the time they get to highschool. Most students know what they wanna do when they get to highschool so its a good idea to commit to a career that you are interested in and enjoy so you can start preparing for a job/career in that field of study.

Yes, students should commit to a career at young age mostly because always a good idea to start earlier than later. In addition this gives more time for preparation and being able to learn more about the career of your choice by selecting electives in highschool that are in that field of study of the career you wanna pursue. Highschool offers many electives and academy classes that students should take advantage of to stay ahead of the game in what they wanna do as a career. Its a smart way and fun way to go deeper in the career you want and learn more from it and have it help you in the future. Commiting early on is key to being more successful in that career and for your journey to that career.

Secondly, commiting to a career at a young age is useful to build up confidence in that student so they have the urge to want to pursue that career and be more serious about what they wanna do. Most students don't take their career selections seriously until senior year or until they graduate highschool. Another reason is that if you're confident in what you wanna do you'll be able to achieve your goal. For example i wanna become an athletic trainer/fitness instructor and i am taking the fitness instructor class next year for my senior year to prepare and learn more about what i wanna do. They also offer a test at the end of the year to certify you as a fitness instructor so i am confident in taking that test and still expand my study at college because i believe and i really wanna have this as a career.

Lastly, If you commit to a career early enough you can start working as part time for that career for example, after highschool and if i pass the fitness instructor class and get certified as a fitness instructor i could apply for a part time job at a gym or something related to that and help others out to reach their goal. While i would still go to college to expand my learning in althetic training having a part time job in doing what i love would be great. It could also help out with expenses and anything else. The earlier the better and more opportunitys would be opened to students.

In conclusion, students should commit to a career sometime in highschool just so they can start preparing and builidng up confidence in what they wanna do.

In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn:

How to save up money for a better future

How to have a better behavior

You learn how to spell some stuff correctly

How to write essays

There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early."
2837,CE7FCD160837,"It's been brought up that student should chose a career and be committed to it before entering high school. Do you think its a good idea for students to be committed to a career at a young age? Even though choosing a career at a young age gives you a early start on researching that career. Choosing a career at a young age is bad idea.

Its been proven that even collage students change a career they want to major in. So when it comes down to committing to a career at a young age there is a high possibility that a student will change it down the line.

Although there about to enter high school students still need more time on choosing s career. Students are 14-15 years old making chooses that even 18-20 havent even desisted on yet and dont even know all there interest and hobbies yet. It's been brought up that before students enter high school they should have chosen and committed to a career. It has come down to my conclusion that choosing a carer and committing to it a a young age is a bad is a because of many reasons.

1642,7CBB1B6F4E25,"Having electives classes can be a great opportunity to let students choose what they love to do and be lesss stressful. Schools, which do not have electives classes had become less popular. Students choose to study in schools that are less complicate for them. Although some say students should be required to take class in the arts actually, students classes should be electives because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit and they will have less worries.

Those who believe students should be required to take class in the arts have their reasons. They believe students have to be more responsible and pass all their classes. They also think students can learn how to be good in arts.

One reason, why class in atrs should be electives is because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit. For example, my friend Generic_Name he only had to take Algebra 2, English 12, U.S Goverment, and Chemistry to graduate this year. However, he had to take one class in the arts that was required to graduete. But, Generic_Name did not have more space during that day,

and the other day of school Generic_Name had to work to help his mother.

If Generic_Name did not have to take the class in arts. He will be able to graduate this year. In addition, he will not waste his time in one class that maybe will not be interesting for him. Also, he will be able to help his mother about taking care of his litter bother. When she was working, so his mother did not have to work less hours.

Another reason, why classes in school shoud be electives is because students will have less worries. For instance, my friend Generic_Name. One day she had to study for her History

ESOL. As well as, she had to make a big and beautiful draw for her class in art. Generic_Name took almost all the night making the draw ,so she did not have time to study and she fall the

ESOL. If Generic_Name did not have to make the draw for her art class. She will study for the ESOL, and she will get enough sleep. Generic_Name will be able to think and pass her test. And she will have more time to study. Sometimes taking a lot of classes is not a good idea for students bacuse it is to hard for them to concentrate.

To conclude, I believe that class in arts should be alectives becuase students will be more confident in doing what they love to do. Also respecting students opinions can be a great opportunity to demostrate them that school cares about what they feel. For those reasons I think class in arts should not be required. One is that students will use the free time more helpful for their benifit.

Another one is that students will have less worries. School have to see what their students need to make them capable and sucessful.   "

Generic_Name

Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.

Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.

With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.

A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.

Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.

Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.

As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.

Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly. "
924,46EF1F716C52,"Did you know that some teachers/educators want year round of school. My decision for this topic would be, I want year round of school. I feel it would benefit students and teachers to actually focus and maintain on school work. Some students would disagree with this, but there are some supportive reasons why this would benefit the both.

Reasoning number one, Most students take a 3 to 4 month summer break. If there was year round schools it would 3 to 4 week summer break, a longer winter break, and one week off for winter and fall time. This would benefit students to be able to retain lots of amounts of information. Also students would have an extra break for the one week off in the fall time.

Reasoning number two, Students who take more than a 2 month break will most likely forget what they have been taught in school. That adds more work to teachers because they would have to re teach the information back to the students, and it would take longer for the students to remember the information. Students who would do year round of school would be able to remember the information that they were taught and it would be less work for teachers for them to re teach it.

Last reasoning, After when students come back for a break most teachers have to re teach what they taught the students before break. Also normally when students come back from long breaks some teachers start giving tests or even quizzes. Most students don't study while they are on break, so they are likely not able to recieve a good grade on the test and quizzes. But with year round school the students would be able to obtain the information and less likely fto orgot what they have been taught before Summer, Spring or Winter break.

Overall, It just seems students and teachers would benefit a lot more with school being year round. The teachers would have less to re teach and students can obtain more information. Also it would help studnets do better when it comes to taking to tests or quizzes. So it would be a win win for everybody. "
2832,CE43CDF8BAA4,"Social Media,Technology,and Education. The World around us is a beautiful place , but we do not take notice.

The smart phones play a vital role in today's society , it is the hobby of the century. The schools are now taking the advantage of the new technology , but along with the new use comes new problems.

Although, using the technology in schools becomes a faster way to learn , most schools are relying in the new invention of the century. Nevertheless, distraction in the schools will be a problem, also the students will be less perceptive in class because the students will fail to maintain self control over their devices and the results will be disastrous in their future.

To begin, the students in the school should have all the things they need to learn such as books, they should not rely on the devices to give them certain information. For example, the internet has a wide variety of information which could have a negative or a positive impact on the user , also the information in the web is very inaccurate which could lead to misunderstanding. This shows that the students could gain wrong information and could be getting a misconception in the topic , which could lead to failure in academics and to achieve nothing in their future careers. Clearly, the user have to make a wise decision between using an information in their cell phones that could possibly be wrong, or use a textbook that it is revised by many authorized teachers.

Further more, in today's society there is social media which is use to stay in touch with close family members who are far away. Cell phones are a great tool for anything , it is a mini computer. The students will be using their cell phones in social media to talk to friends instead of focusing on their task. For instance, if the school allowed such action, not only will be making a very poor decision but the school will earn a bad reputation from parents and even to the national level. This proves that it will not only hurt the kids academically but the school itself will have a downfall in popularity. Obviously, the teachers and staff will be unemployed by the county due to the lack of income from the state , teachers but not only students will be damaged by the decision that could be taken.

Overall, having the ability to own a cell phone is a privilege to have not a right , teachers and administrators should take away the device from the student if and only if the student is not cooperating, and return it at the end of the school day or simply not bring it to school. The devices were not made to harm others in many ways that people have tried .Social media plays a role too in the students it is like a temptation in their pockets , they always have to update their status in social media and text their friends and stay off task. In conclusion, Cell phones are a great way to study and do some homework and stay in touch with family members but in school is a learning place where it should stay like that and cell phones should not take that away.

At time I may not succed the way I want but I took my mistake like a lesson which I will be more careful in my next move.

910,45E9622CF8F7,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' Even though some people disagree, I agree with Emerson's statement. The world that we live in has always been cruel and it will always be.

Growing up in life you will see a lot of people trying to bring you down, do the wrong things and take the wrong path, it is your job to make the right decisions. For example, friends will invite you to do wrong things such as doing drugs, something you are not suppose to do, it will only get you addicted, poor, homeless or all of these combined. They will ask you if you want to try it and they will tell you that it is just for fun and that you will like it, don't listen.

You will see people trying to make you do other bad things,even worse then doing drugs, such as stealing from other people,

beating somebody up or even killing someone. Be yourself and don't listen to those type of people. Stealing, beating or killing is illegal acts and it will only get you in jail or even maybe killed.

Another reason why I

agree with Emerson's statement is because y ou should stay away from people that doesn't care about their acts,life or future. Don't try doing crazy things just to fit in because someone told you to do it, be yourself, be happy, and people will like you the way you are, they will accept you the way you are, even with all your problems.

Forget about what the world wants you to be and focus on yourself so you can be whatever you want to be. Life is too short for people to tell you how to live your life, you only get to live once, it should be your right to live right. And this is why I believe being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.                            "
2055,9ADC4A3BFDD0,"Taking classes online or video conferencing is one of the best way to help students,who can not afford to go to college and for older people that couldn't get the chance to further their education because of their financial state. Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free.

Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day.

Students benefit from being able to attend classes online from home because, they accomplish more and get worked done faster in due time. With less distractions, they understand and enjoy the lesson, it helps them concentrate and more focus on what is being taught to them. They get to ask questions online, they also get more time to go over the lesson again to the right state of understanding the lesson. Lecturers reduce a lot on online students with less work and projects for them to have be ready for other assignments being given to them.

Taking classes online or video conferencing gives one enough to take care of other things, to be on time for lectures, help other students that couldnt go to college to feel they also have the right to achieve their goal once in a life time and to help others without transportion save money and more organised and time managment."

Hello I hope you doing well, my name is Generic_Name. The present letter is to let you now that I'm fascinating of your business management, and I'll be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at.

In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future.

To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like.

Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldn't achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else.

The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesn't have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for.

I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things.

Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.     "
214,101576652D3B,"The British naturalists and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. I agree with this statement because people should know how to make decisions themselves instead of relying on others to do it for us.

Although we are surrounded by people who influence us ever since we where young, people should choose their own character because people should make decisions by themselves more often. Everyone isn't the same, and we shouldn't always be taught to follow what we see everyone do. It's important that we make choices by ourselves because by doing so, it makes us stronger humans beings who can rely on ourselves and helps us gain self confidence and makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do.

Even though Influences help you know what's right from what's wrong, people should choose the person they want to because the people you know might be setting bad examples and you wouldn't even know that they're wrong because they told you it's right. For example, growing up, your guardians could be anyone. They could be good people, or they could be not so good people. It's our job to use common sense and decide for ourselves what's right and what's wrong. It's always good to use your brain and decide if something is morally right or wrong. If you see someone close to you being a bad influence, then one must learn to not replicate those actions, but instead make good decisions their selves.

Some might say that influences help if you're lost or confused in life, however, another reason why people should create their own character is because attempting something on your own and not succeeding helps you grow as a person. For example, if you just follow what everyone else is doing, you won't learn because thats the equivalent of you being spoon fed. If you dont attempt anything of your own, you won't know how to do anything by yourself. By always letting people make decisions for you, you won't be able to complete tasks on your own and makes you a less independent person. This is why making your own decisions is important. Not only does it help you grow as a person, but it also strengthens your mind.

In life, people often rely on others to build the person they are but in reality, it's better to rely on yourself instead of others to make decisions because it makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do, helps us avoid bad influences, helps you grow as a person, and strengthens our minds. All of these things are why we should all grow up by making our own choices and decisions instead of mindlessly do what everyone else does. People have all the power in their selves to be who they want to be. You're no one other than yourself after all, and that's the most important thing to think about when choosing our own character traits."

Some schools don't allow students the use of electronic devices inside their classroom, because the use of cell phones can be a distraction and it can also become an addiction for students in school.

This idea of letting students use their cell phones in their classrooms might stop the developing of their brain and is gonna lead students not to pay attention in class by letting them use their cell phones for special needs in class. However, cell phones have different types of effects worldwide , it can cause people to become slow in their learning and thinking abilities, it can cause vision problems, and it can also be a distraction for everyone.

It has been said that seventeen percent of the world's population has increased their thinking and learning abilities and the number are raising by using their phones daily.

Students are the future of hundreds of nations, students should be teach with words, books, or by letting them find information inside magazines or finding new words in dictionaries.

Some schools don't allow students to take out their electronic devices during class, because schools have computers inside liberties for students to find information when they have permission from their teachers or when they have school work.

By letting students use their cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes can cause a big impact in their physical life and also academic. Experts have discovered that ninety four percent of the students in school use their cell phones to cheat in schoolwork and exams. Most of the students in school struggle in their way to collage or because they didn't used the right method for learning or finding information when they had schoolwork, they didn't developed their thinking ability that at the end it became something hard for them to remaster. This method effects millions of students around the globe when they get out of their education system, this is one of the reasons why a percentage of students struggle in their lifetime when they end their education.

In addition, experts have discovered that when teenagers use cell phones in daily routines in a certain amount of time they might experience vision problems or they can also end up blind, this is all caused by the reflection of the light from their cell phones, this is why experts recommend schools to teach students with books and not to let them use technology because they might experience vision problems at least once in their life time. The cell phone use in classrooms for educational purpose can become an addiction or a distraction for students in school or in their life outside school , they can develope a routine when they won't be able to live without their cell phones and sometimes this cell phones addictions guide people to end up getting hit by cars or by getting involve into car crash accidents, because they were too distracted on their cell phones while driving or crossing the streets.

In conclusion, schools should not allow students the use of cell phones in their classroom for educational purposes, because all of this might guide students to struggle in their academics, or in their personal life outside school. Students take advantage of the use of cell phones in their classroom, students will used this method to cheat in school.

1702,80F9E6D6503C,"do you think that these classes should be electives or a core class?.I say that it should be an elecitve because some peole are taking it as electives and so they cahn graduate on time thats why i say they should make theses classes go for elecitives and kids will like more drama and art and or music classes. more than core classes cause core classses are required for gradutaion and the elecitves are for fun and i think that the school should give these classes as an elecitve because it will be fun to learn new things and explore what you would be good at.

some people may believe that you should take a music class,or art class,or drama class however; i believe That those classes should be electives cause their less important then the core classes. but at the same time it would be fun to have one of those classes. and so you expiernce something new. and you get to meet new and differnt people and thats why it should be an elective."
1770,85F5FADDDC0E,"Here's a fact why you should go to the museum, going to a museum helps you pay attention more. A museum is an enjoyable, education activity here's why I think it is, you can be with your friends,learn new things school hasn't taught you yet,you get to move around.

First of all, you can hang out with your friends, so both of you can learn together, understand, spend together so you both can know each other better. Usually when you hang out with someone when it's not during school you can build your friendship stronger, trust each other better. You feel a lot comfortable around people when you both learn together. Bonding together with someone is really important helps you communicate to your friends, when you forget what happen the next day you could ask your friend.

Secondly, you can learn new things school hasn't taught you yet, or understand things school taught you, but you forgot half of the things. You can review it again, you can also be ready when school teaches you that lesson or subject and you would already know what happen. Study shows if you go to a museum you will likely pass that class you're struggling with. When you go to a museum, improve you listening skills and pay attention better, later on you can pass your tests and SOLS.

Finally, you get to move around when you're in school your brain gets tired so it focuses on other things when it should be paying attention,your brain pays attention when you're moving. When you're sitting down you usually think about sleeping soon, and you forget things fast when you don't pay attention and get a bad grade in that class. Or forget what to turn in,or even forget to write important things down like notes, tips, what you're gonna do tomorrow in school. Moving around calms your brain down and your body too, you wouldn't feel rushed, or you wouldn't feel sleepy at all.

In conclusion, this is why you should go to a museum, you can be with your friends, learn about new stuff you didn't know about, and move around. "

I think your students should have community service but i think its only fair to the people that do something bad to do community service, because for example some of the students at school litter and if they do and you catch them you should make them do community service for littering. not all students should do that only the kids that act up because if you put all the kids in that your gana be taking their time away and its gana be worst there gana get mad.

983,4B4A48BAED30,"i as a standby and a typist (whatever that means). i am not fully agree to this extracurricular activity thing that is going around this school, because when i was a mere child. we had this sorta thing to but more easier,but since school nowadays is getting harder then it used to be back in 1950's. this perhaps may be excellent, but like i said before in the begin of my talk. i dont fully agree even though this will help the students. but the extracurricular activity here are well for kids who, are interested in sports, or kids who are interested in taking photos? (which sounds very boring for students at this particular age, well for some of them) or for students who want to make their speech sound like a good speech(a boring one) and sound more exsiqsitict (i dont know how to pronounce it) or whatever the kids like they should maybe join or perhaps join one activity. thats all i have to say from myself. thank you for your perticepice"

1127,57A6B1103088,"Classes Online At Home

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Some people think it is good idea to take classes online. They say they have more time to do they homework. Some people think that take classes online is more easy than going to school. But I think that is more difficult because nobody explain you the thing. If people take classes online they will be not learning nothing. In my opinion it's not good idea because people need help from teachers, some people like to come to school, and they like to distract at school.

Some people like to do they work by they self, but others people need help from teachers. For example my sister always stay after school for help from teachers. She said that they help her with the things she do not know about her classes. She said that she learn too much about her teachers, and she like to come to school because the teachers explain the work. For example when she fail a test she stay after school with the teacher, they review about the test, and she learn more. The teachers find the way to help students after school. The teachers have others things to do but they don't care because they want the students to pass their classes.

Some students like to come to school because they make friends and have fun. For example my brother Generic_Name like to play sports at school. He said that play at school it's fun because he talk with other people. School it's important because we have to know about other people and learn more about what is hapen at school. People have the opportunity to come to school everyday and learn. However, In my opinion is important to come to school because when you graduate you going to be happy with your diploma.

Others might say that classes online is good because they like to work lonely. The school distract people from their houses. Some people need distract and also need socialism with friends. At school is the place that people like and feel safe. For example my friend say that she get distract in school she play a sport, or do a activity with others friends. Also the best way to get distract is to speak with adults people that know more about life. Also distract is doing your homework and listen to music.

In conclution, the teachers help students and they explain the things that the students do not know and online they have to do by they self. Come to school is the best way to learn what you want with your life and want you want to became in your future. School have many distract like games, books that you can read and take home. I think students should come to school and not take classes online. The teachers are the best because they help to much the students. Also they are good persons because explain when you don't know nothing. School is important in life because you need a good education and go to college to have a good work in your future.                               "
3511,EF5B4AE52BE6,"In some societies, some students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The courses of study in High School are selected to guide them toward a specific career. It would be amazing if students start when they enter High School. It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students.

First, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it would helps to develop more. For example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. Some students really want to success and get everything in life. Students would always like to have good future over everything. If students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. For example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. Their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. They going to take things more serious for their life.

Secondly, start a career at a young age it's important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity. For example, Generic_Name was a student from Generic_school, she choose to start commit to a career when she was 17 years old. It was hard for her because she took a lot of extra classes. But, she planned to get better lifestyle. She work really hard to complete what she want. By, Generic_Name start a career at a young age was the best option she did in her life, she have a lot of opportunity, she can work wherever she want to. Thus, start thing at a young age students would success more.

However, some people may argue that students should not be commit to a career at a young age because students would not enjoy High School. For example, people argue that students would be more incline about their career, and the would not enjoy High School as a teenager. However, start at a young age would be benefit for students because they would take High School as serious part of life. Also, students would have more opportunity in life, and they would develop more as a person.

To conclude, people would always say that students should no be start a career at a young age. But start at a young age would be the best choice for students in life. Students have the opportunity to be more successful in their careers. Sometimes would be hard for them to do double work, but as they focus and work hard, they would complete a lot in life. Start things at a young age always have good benefits for students and people in general."

First of all, it is fun to go Busch Gardens. I heard that their are some good games that I can enjoy. My friends told me that are a lot of good shops for shopping. If I ever go their I would spend all my savings on buying games and toys. The best thing in their is I can spend time with my family.

Next, I would love to try all the rides. The first thing I would like to do in there is to ride the biggest roller coaster. I would love to try every single ride that is in their. Those rides are probably fun than any other thing. Then I would get in the horror house and scare my sister. Afterward, I would get in that maze and try to solve it.

Finally, the last reason is it is the place that I never visit before. I really want to go there because I just heard about it from my friends and other peoples. I think it is a good place to visit with my family. All my friends always recommend me to go their. They said that it is a great place for me to visit in the world.

1544,76C0FD26B20A,"I think sometime is good online because any students no have time so many students work part time,then can't go to the school the better option is take a little free time and make online.

First :But is better they go to the school because if you need something you can took with you teacher or partner is past time with amazing friends and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes .

second : some times the students no came at the school because they live long them no have money for transportation or when need buy any book ,any students don't have the support of your family ,i think is the way more easy and very well for the people can do it some thing ,we need more people have want learning more the way the best election for our the student speaks , writes and lives not on a thing barren changeless level but with all the breadth and height and depht and movement yyou have a right to as a human being .As you ever open discover those words ,the online can be the most important web you ever open.

Third:There are probably very few people would claim online las their favorite book .However all the words are there ,it is the order ,But if you need company whose work it is to prepare materials that advance your learning and show you how to think for yourselves , the online web is the reason the words stand for things and feelings , from outline and notes to the final form of the paper .It tells you how to write paper .how prepare for applying for a job .However It gives you advice you need to choose the correct language and to avoid expressions ,after its helps you understanding their parts and pronunciation .

Finally : The online web is very well for everybody because in the web we can find the signification about whatever word, that we dont know and helps for keep going more learning for get good job ,after you can use the online web for look video that you are curious then helps own like better people make our life better for everybody, if you dont know the support your family the class online help for you keep gonig learning more ."

Writting SOL Grade 8

Before, I would always like to try and play the guitar. My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I always tried to play the flute. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. I always like to sing along with music or people. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them.

Another, thing I like to do is workout/exercise. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I used to be in boot camp. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosen't have that type of money to pay the surgery. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. I don't really know what they are doing to me. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I don't think I would fit right in. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt 'll fit right in. I don't think i'll have a great future. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and i've been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment.

Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I can't do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place.

In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosen't look like it. I have played with my brother before but i'm always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i don't even know. I'm not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops.

Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I don't know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I don't know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. That's why I always got to try on it. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades i've been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I can't. In the future I will just not now cause I can't jus try i can't say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. I'm just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I will not only make them proud cause i'll also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully.

I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i don't even know if i'll be abke to accomplish it and make it.

All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it. Never give up on big dreams like these. Everyone should try to make the best out of you."
1388,6B2FD789B8C8,"To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. This model will be helpful for students, and teachers at same time. By giving them more time to relax. It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. We all as a student need more time to prepare for future, and work as hard as possible to pass our classes. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax,

to grow and achieve more, and to help others.

We all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more.

Most of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Three days weekend will give students and teachers more free time to care about themselves. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they don't have time to do it. They are working Saturdays' and studying on Sundays'. One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. Reading, exercising, meditating, and swimming will help human to grow and learn more to achieve more. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time.

Some of the students love to help others, by volunteering. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time. Although, their are a lot of students who need help in some of their classes because they have a bad grade. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. He said, ""I love to help students outside of school, but I don't have time to do it"". I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they don't have time. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world.

To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. And this will help students and teachers to have more time to relax, to care about themselves, and to help others. Students can have more time with their families,

to grow, and to work harder and achieve their goals. Furthermore, teachers are also the same, teachers need more time to spend with their families and kids, and they will be able to plan what are they going to do, or what they want to do with certain students who needs help. Also, in weekdays they can learn more, or teach more. Which it is a great opportunity to both of them to achieve more. "
1287,62DCD859B7FB,"I undestand the company Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "" Unless you try to so something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Base on your experience, I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo because he is trying to convince us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow.

Is it important to know if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. For example, if we want to invest our money in something that is very expensive and we do not have a lot money to pay it but we insist to invest in that we are not going to get ahead. Another example is, when is almost time to pay bills we have to save money to pay them.

Because he is trying to convice us if we do not think before doing anything we will never grow. I think is a good idea from Ralph Waldo. Thank you for considering my ideas regarding."
2244,A80542F83A7C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school.

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction.

Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies.

Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing.

Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful."

Students can earn respect from there friends, teachers, classmates and maybe even staff if they can be nice enough or if they work hard and they have respect for other people like there teachers or if they put a lot of effort on a thing they will automatically gain respect from other people in there school. All students work hard but not all earn the respect they expect but if students respect each other they can earn respect among themselves.

2433,B4B8BEB77C2E,"One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university.

First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country.

Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college.

Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first.

As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. But also is the way that you can work and get money. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future. "
3873,FE822B3E72FC,"On this time most the people had failures on their life, a failure is something that always gonna happen on the life. Some people get it on the good way and they make of each failure a lesson for their life , also a failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best , each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step

Some people get the failures on good way when they learn about it. All the failures have a lesson for your life, the first reason why a failure give you a lesson is because. If you never do it wrong you will never learn about the failure. Second you learn about the failure when you made it before and you do again but now you do it good for example. If your teacher give you 10 days to do a presentation on your computer and, the first day you say i will do it tomorrow and you say the same the next day until a night before the day that you have to turn the work you start do it , and you don't have enough time and you get a bad grade. The next day it was a failure and you will learn about it because the next time you will do it on time.

A failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best the next time. When you do something wrong for first time you feel bad and you want to do it wrong again , inclusively if it was a little mistake you don't want to and you got motivation. Most the people owners of big companies obtain motivation when they have a failure on a business, they don't give up they get motivation to do their best on the next business for example. You went to your work and it's your first day and your boss told you that you have to finish all of your signatures 10 minutes before the end of the day , and you finish it 15 minutes after , your boss can get mad and give you a warning and you have to get it like a motivation to do your best the next day and keep going.

Each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step. The failure coming and coming on ours life sometimes it come hurt and sometimes it doesn't, all of those make you more stronger, give you a lesson and make you be alert for don't get it mistake again. It make you more stronger means that you don't gonna feel weak again when you commit a mistake , also you gonna be alert and take your precautions on your next step for example. If you are on a team of soccer and you are the goalkeeper, and while you are talking with a friends , one of the other team hit the ball and make a score it was your fault. Your coach gonna scold you for it but you gonna be alert for the next time and you also gonna be more stronger because you learn about of your mistake.

The primer minister Winston Churchill had the reason when he said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" I think that if everyone doesn't have any failure on their life, they never know how hard can be a success person on this world. They never learn about their failure and maybe they don't encourage to the best on their jobs in conclusion all the people have more then one failure on their life but they make of it something good on their life."
3514,EF8047505E53,"Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Being active like career goals and helping others and being inactive can lead to alot of health proplems.

Do people accomplish more if there pursuing their own interest, or just being inactive also accomplish goals also?

Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life. Just being inactive is bad in general but people do have opinions on about it. Some people like to stay inside, not get a job, dropout of school, and fisk of having a unhealty body.

Being out of contact of the world is bad, and it very unhealthy to do that.

Next is being active. It serves a purpose, and it benefits a lot in life like: maybe healthy body, pursing career goals, school goals, and helping others. Getting a job is good example of being active. Taking time out of the day to go accomplish anything that people are interested in is a good idea. People can pursue new learning skills in school or universities. Being active and getting goals accomplished is good in life.

Having to participate in a activity will do good in life. As Jefferson said ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much mat be dine if we are always doing"".

There will always be different opinions on being active and inactive but not everyone is the same in the world."
3540,F094225CAE4F,"I am agree with this idea because is the best opportunity not only to the hispanic people, well for everyone who want to follow his/her dreams, and has responsability or lower resources.

I think is great idea, because some students sometime or usually work. One reason why the students do not go to the high school is because they do not have enough time to do homework, study, or just hey want to make more money.

Rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. This idea is great and amazing to someone really dream and feel that the high school is the door to the college, university, or opportunity to do your dreams real. The advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. The disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. The good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and What do you really want to be or to do?. Do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams.

I think is a big opportunity to me; well, I work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""I cant anymore"", and I want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime I think like that just say me "" NEVER GIVE UP "", always remember everything I did, why am i here?,and How too far wil be go for my dreams?.

Sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, While others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today. Well, that it's my point and why I am agree with this awesome idea. I have been thinking this system or program will be helpfull and better for every student that the system we have today. My view is if you finish the high school in three years, will be more effective, easy, and fast to be gratuated.

Thank you for your attention. "
1070,520EAF052C7E,"I Think that Technology is a positive thing. Becuase it help's people get there stuff done thru the internet

The internet has become a huge part in our life's becuase we use are phones for every thing. it's good that technonlogy has improved because back in the old days technology was not there but now.

you can order anything online and it will be there less then a week. now and days if people are sick they can use there phones to look up how they can cure themselves. it has also improved because back then people couldn't facetime to see their relatives. but now they can see their family memebers from any forein country.

If need to learn how to cook or bake all you have to do is look it up on google and it will show you pictures,videos.

and also show's other recipes on how to cook other foods. you can mostly do everything oline and it's easy to do. technonlgy has developed a easy way on how to get shuff done with out leaving the house. most people send most of there day in there phone watching videos. socail media has also inproved. a lot of people just post pictures.

Some people like social media because it's like a news paper it tell's you what has been going on in people's life.

it also shows funny videos and new stuff that people have invented. you can also talk and meet new people by texting and facetime. I believe that tecnology has taking over the world because some people can not live without there phone."

Other reason is because I will feel like finally I share my own story with the world and they will know how hard is lived in the world, for some people and how easy is for other.

When finally about my story they will put they face up and will feel like I'm not the only person with this life someone in the world have the same life I do now and the will be different and will said yes to the life they have in the present because all of us know how hard the problem are our own life.

I agree with him because him try to proud my own story and try to be different then others he thing about my experience and try to change what i did wrong in my life. He will change others life and what he is writing I will be happy with that because others guys will see what was wrong and what they have to change and they life. for example if i did something what i keep in my mind and I try to get back the time and now is to late is something what I can't do now I will fell like I help others to don't do what is wrong and they life. in sometimes we feel like terrible but we can change that when is the right time to do it but there is where we don't want to change anything in our way and when is to like we want to do something but is very late for some of us. but I will feel like wire when I'll see a book about myself because will be all what i did before and who I'm now. but the, Author Ralph Emerson wrote, my story because he though was important to to talk about other person and thing about what they do or what is going on in different's in some life and moved to others to change something but when we know any story or we red something the first thing we see on it is the what is important and what and what part describe the person in the story. when the author will writing something he get the all information he can can fist and then stars with the the important part to proud the feeling to reading that story.

the author like to share what he know ir what he investige fir others and try to moved others to grow up when they feel like they can follow the liofe but there is where they stop to something wrong tehy are doing at the time. for reasons like that is they like to we have author and good storys."
582,2C38B62420C3,"Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that we don't need community service hours because, some students do well in school and they don't get to go to all the 8th grade fun activities that they have by the end of the school year. Like a lot of students do very well in school but they cant go to the fun activities or graduate from 8th grade because they don't have community service hours. If students have bad grades and they have a green sheet that you are failing 8th grade and they have to get 5 and up grades and they are showing progress then i think that its fair to let the students graduate from middle school even do they didn't do service hours. That's why i say that its fair too let the students graduate from middle school even do they didn't do service hours. i know that theirs a lot of students that haven't done the service hours and they are really worried that their parents may get mad at them for not graduating 8th grade. So that's why i' m saying that that's why we don't really need service hours.      "
3068,DA6899CADE97,"The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although many people believes that Churchill's statement is wrong, I believe in the important role that failure plays in people's lives to be successful in the future. In fact of the society, failure is a bad experience, however, I believe that failure is a way to help people to grow in personally, to be more successfully, and teaches you how to be mannerly.

Every single day, we are exposed to a reality that can be favorable or unfortunate. Where people need to learned about their failures, and grow personally from their new experiences. They made you more mature. That can be the example of my aunt, a nice woman who had an accident in the past. She was traumatized after that accident, but that never stop her to receive professional help with enthusiasm and do what she likes to do, helps others. My aunt understood that everything is possible if we do not loss our enthusiasm, and our pleasure to be success.

Life treat of deal with all unexpected situations. Failures that people never thought that could happen to them. However, everything depends on your enthusiasm, if you want to stay in the same place or learned about your failure and keep going until you accomplish your dreams. Generic_Name, a friend, is an example of the statement just mentioned. Generic_Name wanted to pass his classes in order to graduate. Generic_Name's teachers always told him that he was wasting his time if he was planning to go to the university, but Generic_Name never loss his hopes. Generic_Name became more expert in every subject, he graduated. Moreover, he demonstrated that everybody could be successful, if they try their best.

Everything has two faces, like a coin. As failures can be bad experiences, they can also be helpful if we look at them with good eyes, and if we receive them with good manners. People need to realize that the way in which a thing is happening is not bad at all. Things happens to foment our self and made us more mature. An example of this can be all of us. When we are passing for a bad moment we need to control our behavior, take a rest and think in a positive way to be successful.

In conclusion, Churchill's statement is more than right. Do not pay to much attention to the different failures and keep going with enthusiasm, is the key to be successful in life. Accomplish a dream that we are fighting for, is the best that could happen to everybody. That is why we do not need to discourage and loss our enthusiasm just for a failure that happened to us.  "
1203,5D5672D7C97D,"The famous scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" This is especially true for today's world. Even with seven billion people on Earth, everyone is unique. Your imagination is vast; an open plain of wondrous ideas and possibilities. This leads to even more diversity than our physical differences. It is also applied to our day, and it makes it more lively. And while knowledge is powerful, imagination can make it far stronger. Imagination is more important than knowledge because of creativity and experimentation.

First, imagination leads to creativity. Your can put your ideas to life through creativity, and there's plenty of ways to do so. You can construct a masterpiece of your choosing, whether it be art, music, or even writing! Even thousands of years ago, creativity makes its mark. Rough drawings by cavemen depict tales of hunts and adventures. Beautiful artifacts and pottery dot museums. Ancient literature such as Beowulf and The Odyssey still fascinate modern writers. And recently, artists and musicians such as Bob Ross and Duke Ellington have made amazing pieces through their creativity, just like the legendary Leonardo da Vinci and Beethoven. Time wears things down, but not imagination. This is immensely important as creativity allows you to express yourself. You can voice out your thoughts and ideas in so many forms. With imagination being limitless, so is your creativity, and so are your possibilities.

Next, imagination leads to more experimentation. Going mad-scientist isn't recommended, but you can poke around with new ideas and find a new talent or hobby. More experimenting can lead you to find something you really enjoy!

Trial and error can be disheartening, but don't give up! You could find something that could change your future. It can be fun too; testing different paths to a single destination. Not only can you find the best road to a goal, but you can spread the knowledge to others. The results from tinkering around varies from little things to giant discoveries. Take Damascus steel for example. The forging process for the metal has been lost, which has consistently frustrated modern metallurgists. A steel from times long gone, but still baffling today's scientists. That's a pretty amazing feat! Experimenting from your imagination is wild, but it's enjoyable and even rewarding!

However, some say knowledge helps daily life more than imagination. Valuable things, such as language, mathematics, history, and science. Knowledge does help with life, but most of the things you learn are often useless or forgotten along the way. Math and Language Arts are important, but unless you're pursuing teaching or poetry, some aspects aren't very useful. For example, being acknowledged that plants are green because of chlorophyll isn't going to help with paying taxes. Imagination can make life better and enjoyable. Decorating your house or doodling a picture can be more relaxing and fun than first thought. In addition, most of the knowledge obtained can't be applied without a good imagination. And while some people may have an upper edge in academics, everyone is on equal ground in imagination.

In conclusion, being able to experiment and create with limitless possibilities makes imagination more important than knowledge. Making ideas come to life is fun and shows what you're capable of. Creativity holds the ever-important ability to express yourself. Experimentation is enjoyable and can be rewarding. You never know what you can do unless you try, and testing your skills is a great evaluation. And all of this traces back to one thing everyone has: an imagination."
3425,EB03C897F7E8,"Student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons. However, according to new Stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone.

Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working

""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new idea's. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity.

Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes.

Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone

Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group.

if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group

Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others.

working in a group is also good for getting other people's opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement.

Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated. New idea create diversity is the way to success."
2452,B6ADED946A1A,"Hello Ms or Mr teacher,

I'm writing this for convince you to don't work in groups ,and here are my cons and pros about working alone or in groups. The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete differents because some people feel more comfortables working alone than working in groups. In my oppinion working alone is much better than working in groups. In some cases your teammates of you group don't participates in the work or they don't want to work in groups. I feel more comfortable working alone for many reasons.

First reason , I can do whatever I want to do in the work or do the work in my way, but in some cases the person who work alone doesn't know how to do the work in this case is good to work in group because maybe your teammates knows the answers of the work.

Second, If I work alone I have more chances to unertand the work by my self without distractions. Because in some cases your teammates of your groups are distract you or other teammates of the group.

Third, working alone can be more benefict than working in groups because you can learn more things about the work, and do it in the way you like the work, without worry about what your group is doing. If we work alone we will have the opportunite of learn more about the work.

I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you dont have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you . But in some cases people who don't participate in the work gets credits in the work what he or she doesn't participates it. And that isn't fair for you or your teammates who did the work.

That's why you should sonsiderate us to do not work in groups anymore."
30,02B36EBD5C66,"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses can't enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school.

Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete.

It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them.

Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school.

In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams. "
2586,BFCE7D755436,"Do you think should student to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes ?

A lot of young people has cell phones that can use for many ways. The young people use their cell phones for text with their family or do their homework, but Today's many kids are going away from people. However, they use the cell phone in bad ways in classroom, so, I believe students should not use the cell phones in class because they could cheat in their exams and get easy score.

The first reason , when the teacher says, ""get out the phone, we are going to start study in our phone"". The students does not care when the teacher is giving the instructions of the topic. A lot of students are going to playing games or listening music and when the teacher ask question about of the topic they would say, ""i do not know' and every body starts to laugh because they were not paying attention in the classroom and their grades is going down.

The second reason,Today's in the world student only put their face in the cell phones. A lot of student use the cell phone for their social media in classes, therefore, Student are not paying attention in class when the teacher is explaining the topic. However, student when the cell phone is allowed to use, they will have more focus in their social media than classes. For example, A lot of student have the famous ""snapchat"" that it is film videos for ten seconds and share in your story for people see them, Student with their cell phones are going to put any video in their story to showing the teacher talking or everybody laughing.

Another reason and is the most important, Student cheat in exams with their cell phones because the teacher says, ""you can use your cell phones in this test"". however, students do not study for any home work or test. they can get a easy score. For example, they know can use the cell phones in test, but this time the teacher says, ""you cannot use the cell phones in this test."" The student are going to get bad scores because they thought that can use the cell phone to get a great score. however, a lot student do not study for any test when they can use the cell phone.

However, The propose of the teacher is that student earn easy information and good scores. The allowed to use the phone has a good way that students can search homework or read a book. Sometimes the teacher gives homework to do at home and you will use your cell phone for solve the homework. For example, students are learning other language and do not know some word in the information gave the teacher, they can use the translate to know the word.

In conclusion, Students should not allowed to use the cell phones in classrom because they are not going to learn anything at the final of year. Allowed to use the cell phone is a disadvantage for students in the futures in their jobs because they were always in their cell phone playing or social media."

Nothing can make you stronger then failure. It make's you more success In life, even helps you to learn a life lesson, that you can do much more then what you could image to build your life and happens.

When you did something and It makes you failure don't think that why did that happened, or why did you do that although, give up that you can't solve It, you should know and everyone else that we all are strong we will not know until failure comes to you that you are much stronger and be powerful with what you have and what come's to you

Nothing Is more Important then success your life, sometimes failures and make you life hard but It can make your life more powerful, that you will trust yourself and, It will make you stronger and you will take more responsibility for your next steps. For example, my father would tells me all the time that when you get older have your on business and you need to be strong If your not strong ""failures"" can heart you so that's why you need to work so hard and be strong as will to reach your goals. Although even If you have a good life don't think that's It that you will not have any problems anymore. If you don't work hard and not be strong failure can make your life so harder

On the other hand, life is a lesson and challenge for everyone It can take a risk so you need to be strong for what ever come to you and be powerful for not any failures so to you and break you. For example, my mom would tell me life Is a lesson each day you will learn something different and you will get stronger so you don't know when and what will happen to you so mantle and physically be strong. However If you did something learn you mistake lesson to not do It again and forget the mistake.

However, It's not good to have failure some people can't handle It so they kill them self. On the other hand, failure Is good because they know how strong and powerful thy are and nothing can break you or failure you.

Being powerful and strong Is so Important so that life will change you no matter. How or why, so you should all ways learn your lesson that, why or how did failure In your success life and happiness never let anything come between you, because you will get stronger each time and better."
2455,B6E9E12159E3,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad and her friends. They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue!

I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts on what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on.

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. "
1900,8F16365E363D,"Online classes or video conferencing it is one of the many opportunities that some school offer, for those who have a full time job and they really have the volunteer to graduate but they doesn't have the time to attend to school,they still can graduate, taking online classes and complete the credits that they need...

for example: my bother is taking online classes because he works full time, and wants to support the family at the same time.

Students are going to be more than benefit because they will have the opportunity to finish their classes.

The program distance learning has many advantage:

the students will have more space and time to review the same, if they did not understood it.

they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule, and they can take the class when they want.

they will not miss any class for any weather changes, etc.

Personally I think that is a great opportunity for us, because if we are not able to attend at school, the school gave us the opportunity to take online classes that way we can finish our classes and to graduate, also it is not like that you have to be there an specific time."
3595,F2B360408003,"Imagine taking advice from two people, which person should you choose? Asking advice from two people is a hard digestion to make, but he will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he will know which advice to choose. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience.

First, reason is he will know which advice to choose. He will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. For example, if he asks advice from his best friend and his friend he would go with his best friend's advice because that is his gut feeling. He also knows if it's smart, or not. He knows he has to listen to his heart not his head.

Second, reason is he will have better opinions of advice, than bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience. For instance, if seeking advice from his mom ans his best friend he would choose his mom's advice. His mom has more experience. The older people are also wiser too.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because the person will know which advice to choose. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, it's because older people have more experience. In the future advice can change your life. It's difficult digestion to make, but when you seek multiple opinions you will choose the better choice."
3792,FABE0E966789,"Dear, Principal

Students may bring there phones to school but they could only use them while there in lunch or any free time. Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Student's phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class.

On, this policy by having phones at school the students should just leave their phones at home so it wont be taken by the teacher or so you wont loose it at school or other students wont have to rob you. So that's why students should really leave there phones at home. Another thing why students should not bring their phones to school at all it might fall and brake when you walk or if your texting you might bump into each other

I believe that students really need to leave there phones at home because someone might call in the middle of class. or a friend might text you in the middle of class also so students leave your cell phones at home.."

951,48BBB107A05C,"Should people be able to make their own decisions or should people find some help?

As we know, sometimes we just dont take bad decisions at work, we also take bad decisions in our personal life, and it is not just because you felt it was right. Every day for some reason your feelings are involve so that makes that your ideology of your decisions change, and lets talk about meet someone or get a new job opportunity, every little detail change the way that you think, feel, talk, and yes the way you make decisions and that is okay and normal.

Make our own decisions is one of the things that characterize us as a humans, our necessity to express what we feel, what we wish, is the thing that have show us what are we capable of make, do, learn, built, invent, all the things that you can imagine in here are because humanity express their thoughts and make their own decisions.

Otherwise you are autonomous and you do not need that someone tells you what to do all the time, but do not take my point wrong, I am not saying you can do whatever you want because sometimes you would need some help and I can give you some examples where and how sometimes you would need help and your decisions and choices can not be just yours.

It can be in a court, your job, school or when you are not an adult, as you can see that there are some places, situations and times you can not decide for you own.

I believe we can make our owns decisions because I know if we do everything according to the rules that are around us, we can really choose our life and take responsibilities for that.

In fact, you are free to take your own decisions and be responsible for them(when you choose wrong) because it does not mater if you take a wrong decision, it matter that if you have the opportunity to try and figure what you want, it is okay to be wrong sometimes and also is wonderful to be right, the important thing is that you can choose because deserve to have the right to build your life, be wrong, learn and be free."
2319,ACABA85B131B,"Dear Manager,

Did u know that many schools do not have local companies and organization that allow students' to explore certain profession?

I believe that they should have local companies and organization because when work as a teacher, the teacher can help students, have fun with students, and solve problems.

When you work as a teacher, the teacher can help you with anything. Like for example: When you are stuck with any of your assignment ,or doing a project, the teacher can help you with any of your assignment, or a project. However, some teachers do not help with students because the students won't get it, or learn anything. When a student needs help, go ask the teacher for help because when u don't ask, then you won't get help by the teacher. And that it is important to ask the teacher for help because when u ask for help, the teacher won't help you because you didn't ask for help.

When you work as a teacher, it needs to be fun because the student can not be bored and that they need to do fun activity like for example: Like going outside and play fun activity playing educational games that contain subjects like Math, Science, Reading, or History ,or like playing Soccer,Football, and Basketball and do more fun so that the students can not be bored. And that it is important to have fun and instead of being bored and not doing anything in school.

When you work as a teacher, the teacher need to solve problems. Because a student might have bad situation, or might have a ruff day. And so the teacher needs to talk to the student who's having a bad day. Like for example: If a student is having a bad day or a bad situation, the student need to ask the teacher to help with this situation or a problem that u have that is going on. And that it is important because the teacher can help you with anything. Teachers are important because they can solve problems that u have or question that you have so you can tell the teacher about it. And that the students need to tell the truth because when your lying, the teacher won't help you and your getting yourself in trouble, and making your situation more harder and more difficult to yourself.

Therefore, working as a teacher is important because the teacher can help students, have fun with the students, and solving situation or a problem. And it is important to work as a teacher, at the same time it is hard to handle with the students. Consequently, a teacher can handle anything, or any problem that you have, or having a ruff day and you need to talk with someone, or a teacher. And that many school don't have local conpanies and organization that allows students to explore certain profession."
3547,F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

In conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out. "
3576,F1B4090C8B06,"If you challenge yourself, you will never become good at something you want to do or achieve it. Others believe that challenging yourself won't improve your growth. It's only going to make people struggle. Myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. That is how many people become so talented at things they do now.

Going beyond can raise your confidence higher. My first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. The more time I practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. After awhile, I wanted to to play a different instrument. The second instrument option for me when I began playing the flute was a violin. It was more difficult than playing the flute but eventually I got used to it. The more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth.

School is a good example of improving yourself. There are specific kids who has disability in learning called Special Ed. The experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. For the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes. I've got out of self-contained classes by making so many improvements to show that I don't need to be in self-contained.

Going beyond can make a big difference. Going beyond the goal is a great feeling because the goal is achieved and then the on to the next level.                    "
3601,F30AD5A2B74A,"Do you agree with ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, yes or not? I agree with Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiams because not all the time we can win or make the things perfect. For example, when I took my English test last year in my English class. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. I was very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. So, I took it and this time I passed with A-, I was so excited. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesn't matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. Moreover, this year my aunt was trying to travel to El salvador, but when she called to the airline for buying the ticket, the tickets were so spends and she doesn't have to much money, so she decided to wait few months. seven month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickests increase more money, but she didn't want to continue waiting more time so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told to her of her ID was already expire, so she can not buy the ticket. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. at this time the three months already pass and she didn't receive her ID, she's really sad because she wants to go visit my grandmother. even thoug she can't travel yet, she doesn't lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm is more than true because anybody is perfect and we need to fall out for learn lessons and learn to be stronger persons in the life. some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. also, they say when the person loss the first two times they're losers, stupy persons, or other bad things that are not right. in my oponion this cause happend to them or they are saing that because they loss their enthusiams and become weak person. in conclusion, for being successful we have to fall out in the life, like when i fall out my test and with my aunt cause. this teach to everyone to be stronger person and never lose their enthusiams of be successful in each persons life. "
3521,EFCC45260444,"Well on my opinion I think that the best accomplishment is when someone tell you to be your self, no need to act or being someone we are not, It's better when we can be our self on this world.

When someone act something they are not, they are kinda lie about how they really are, When we chose to be something we are not, It's the worse decision that we can do. But I know that every person think different to what others think. some think that act someone they are no is something better for the world. I totally disagree.

We need to stop thinking or worry what other people are going to say, we just need to worry about our self and for the people who accept how we are, with the people we can act how we really are and those people who don't judge are the best people in the world the best accomplishment a person can give is when they tell you that they accept you how you are and that we are unique, don't need to change to something we are not, that is the best accomplishment that someone can give to someone.

I don't agree with what Emerson's statement say because, we don't need to change to someone else. We can't let the world change how we are. I don't think the greastes accomplishment is to be in this world constantly trying to make us something else. The greastes accomplishment is that we show how we really are we all have something unique we need to be ourself in order to make the world better.

Being our self with someone it's kinda the best thing someone can experiment, being our self with a person is the greastes thing in the world, now and days most all the people can't be them self around other people some of them laugh at the people who act exactly how they are, some of them don't really care or pay attention to what others are doing, and I think that's how it should be. now and days we see a lot of things, people that are gay, transgender, people that are bisexual, homosexual, now we see all that for almost all the people in the world that is something normal but most of them is not. but they just acting how they really are but sometimes it can just be confusing.

Something that happened when I was 16 years old is that I had a friend that always was lying of how she really was, she used to said that she had a lot of money which wasn't true, she did have like the normal she was okay with what her parent had, she said that she was rich and all that, and because of that she make a lot of friends even that ones that were my friends stopped taking to me because i wasn't how they wanted me to be, they would tell me to go party with them, to drink, smoke and all that, my answer to all the was always no, so they stopped asking me, later on they find out that the new girl didn't have that much money as she said she had, the people who I thought that were my friends told me all that and the realize that acting something we are not is not always good being someone we are not, or telling people that we have something when is not true. We all have to be honest with each other.

That's why I always tell people be yourself no matter how hard it get, the best thing we can do it's to be our self, people need to start accepting others how they really are, Don't need to be two faces, that is how we saying now in days. Now in days most of people would wear say whatever they want,

most of the people don't care anymore they just focus on what they are doing no in what the others are doing.

When you show to someone else how you really are is because most of the time, we felt comfortable with that person."

I would got church for a day and see what type of religion and what they do for religion. I would check if i would even live there but I still would'ent know because I havent gone yet. but i still bet I would be a wonderful place to go one day

I would also try going because to observe and try learning the language because next if I go i'm going to speck fluently. i would problobly go to school there for an education and learn other different languages because they learn two more languages than us. I could even listento there music because its good. its always better going to new places. A lot of people have said its oneof the nicest places to go. So i might go one day and I might take my fmaily becuase its a pretty friendly place i bet."
2128,9F401E75755A,"In this writing you will find some reason why, 4 years of high school and graduate are better than, 3 years of high school and compare the opportunities that you can find during this years of high school and also help you to make to take your choice.

High school is a great place to know people that could help you in the future, and help you to reach your goals also high school is a great place to learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, 4 years of high school are better than 3 years because you have more time to study, you are able to have a break during summer, and keep your stress lower.

During this 4 years of school you are able to have enough time to study and prepare for a test, if you have a History test you have time to ask to your History teacher to help you, before or after school to make a review or practice, and get ready for the test. This is one reason why 4 years of school are better then 3 years of school, and you will be able to prepare for your next test also you can have some rest in summer.

In 4 years of school you will have a break during summer, and able to enjoy it with your family or friends doing some activities as going to some parks or museums, and any other different activities that you will like to do, and maybe go back to the school with more energy after summer. This reason also could help you to keep your stress lower when you are in high school.

When you are in high school you can stress a lot because you have to many homework and you need to study for a test, and if you take the 4 years of high you will have a lot of time to study do your homework and keep your stress lower, and during this 4 years you can practice some sports or any activity that you like in your school or outside the school and also this could help you to keep your stress lower. During this process of learning you could find people that are not agree with your opinion and they can say 3 years of school are better then 4 yours of school.

3 years of high school sounds great for some people they want to start working or maybe they think it could be easy but you will not able to enjoy your summer because you have a program to follow during summer, and sometimes you would need to stay after school for study, and you are not able to do the different activities that you like.

In my opinion 4 years of high school are better then 3 years of high school and in this 4 years of high school you will be able to graduate and you can enjoy the process of learning, and know a lot of people that could help you to graduate and reach your goals in the future.     "
2773,CB4C85EFAE67,"The author Waldo Emerson wrote a statement or quote that it say ,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" basing on my point of view or experiences, I agree with him, I think the same, we will never grow if we keep doing the samething that we already mastered.

I'm taking this position on this issue becasue I have my reasos to sopport my position and to explain why this author is right.

First reason is on point of view if you're already mastered in something and you're keep doing it , to be better or go beyond then my opinion is that you're wasting your time on something unnesesary because you're already mastered , just be happy with what you have and knows a sample are the

Childrens they always wanna something if they have it they want more and more or when they are playing they wanna play possiblely the all day when they realize the day is already gone but they don't care because they think that they have enough time to play so it is the same with us. sometimes we wanna be betters than another people or just feel good but we're wasting our time in somethin that we already mastered.

Secondly the author Emerson show us the true in a quote we can stop doing something that we already mastered we could try to do something else or try to learn something new that can help us in the future of that way we can start growing because we start to learn about differents things so we have more knowledge and we can survive and we can realize or knows how the life looks like. A sample to be a boss you need to know or have more knowledge at least than yours employs or to be amanager you have to know many things.

Finally unless you try to do it better or be better than the rest of the people always is gonna be someone else who is better than you then that time you're wasting doing something beyond than you knows ,use it to teach someone else or learn about some else how to be better in something , teaching someone else or learning from someone else you can start to grow. A example is a old brother he learn about his parents and also teach and care his youngest brother of the way he is starting to growing up because his taking a responsability .The example can show us that we need to about experiences or advices or people who has more knowledge of that way .

In conclusion for these reason and supporting with examples that I wrote, I agree and think the same with The author Waldo Emerson , I took this position because If we try to do something beyond what we already mastered, we will never grow. Also we wasting our time and we could use that time to learn from someone something else what we do not know or teach to someone else about our knowledge . what we can help us to grow or be better in the future concluding I agree with Emerson's statement."
3257,E2E3D86A8CF8,"based on you experience , do you agree or disagree with Emerson statement should based on your experiences do you agree .

more support to try something do you more go up take more position you have more experiences you never go down should based on your experiences do you disagree

.

no position no ready for that no complete nothing should base on your experience do you agree because have more support in you will go never grow and you try something and you have more experiences . and when you have more experience you go more up it is passive do you have more opportunities and you ready for anything should base on your experience do you disagree because no complete nothing when anyone have experience or support with reason . and when you not have good reading you no go up because you need to practice you first and you go to that what are you doing but when you ready for that when one person no complete everything it is impassive go up . many person go to up because no is ready for that and when you have more experience is more easy for this person you need to ready .

everyone is passive to proper for that because is no easy when you have good experience you good because you state good end good position is more experience star and good position so many peoples no proper for that and is imposing you have good experience thats why you need to proper first my reading for that is more experience and more practice because is more easy for one person practice to that everyone is proper first and you states where you are and something you have so many ideas when you no understand nothing you need to ask your Principe or your teacher or you boss he give to you reason or good question for you or your life or when you complete everything is more easy for you or you understand everything that why you need to ask first so many people practice that so many people no practice nothing ."
534,28C8F048A469,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change it, should people can change their first impression or people can not repair their first impression. However many people think that first impression are impossible to change, people can change their first impression, if they knows more about each other and if a person is passing by a struggling in their life.

People can change their first impression if they know more about each other, for example if a person that meet another at the mall they will have no time to talk about what they like to do in their free time because they has to make their purchases and my friend Generic_Name has a story with a girl that he likes, he said that was difficult to talk with her because that first time he talk to here was in the lunch line and she was hungry so she dont even pay attention to him, one day both of them have detention they star talking and meet more about each other, people can change their first impression if they give the according time to each person.

A person can fix his first impression if that person was no notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk to much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that he's must depress or sad because non of them know the truth. People can not judge other just in one day.

For decades people has been said that first impression are impossible to fixed. A person can change that first impression if they share about their hobbies, characteristics, and tastes and if that person was no in a good mood that day they meet. People around the world judge other just because they talk for one minute or people never ask what was happened in life of the other person. In conclusion a person can change first impression."
457,2286BCFF86EB,"Generic_Name was sitting in the cafeteria listening to music refusing to touch her plate of food, why was she like that?

Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didn't. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses.

First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didn't know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Name's teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didn't know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes.

Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good he'll be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney.

Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it.

In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

541,296B1DD1E251,"Do yo have a good impression? I am agree, the first impressions are almost impossible to change, because I feel that the first impression is important for everyone. There are many people that do not show how really are, and try that everyone love them, but at the end they show how really are and everybody move away. The first impression said everything about us. I believe that, If you show them everything about you, the people will love you how you are and they will trust on you.

Always we need to be honest with you and with the people. My ideology is be honest with yourself and do not show something that you do not are, If you want that everyone show you how really are.

I always show how I am friendly, lovely, funny, charismatic with everyone, and also try to help when someone need me with my knowledge and capacity. One of my experience is in my work, every single day new employees go to work in the store and I always help them to know how the store need to look like, and also with the customers I always smile, because I show my first impression with them, and I feel great when the customers saw me with a smile and they said: Hi, how are you today, it is good to see you and have a good one. I have few months working in the store, and I feel comfortable with everyone, because the customers do not know you enough, but they trust on you and they tell you something about his life, and with the rest of the employees we pass fun, We are like a family and we help us ourselves.

In the school is a little bit the different, because in the school I am shy, I do not talk with anyone just with my best friends, but I always show my emotions, enclose with the new people in the school, but sometimes they pretend be good at the first time, but with the pass of the time they have different attitude. That happen to me around 2 years ago with different person, the first person I knew her in 9 grade, when the both was new in the school, We became friends and everything we did together, but She change with the pass of the years, in summer another friend and his sister told us what she talk about me and my sister, but I always be honest with her and friendly and she showed me something different than the first time. Then, with another girl was a little bit the same, because she had jealous for my sister and I to had good grades and be active in the school the last year, but she always had bad grades, and We tried to help her but she never wanted, then with my sister and I move away from her because she was friendly with us but she was a bad friend with us.

I feel that we need to show always how We are not matter what everyone thing about us. Sometimes is good a new change in our lives, but never changing you essence. Something that I always do is think about my weakness and how can change it to a positive way

Finally, I think that We can be success in the life, the first impression will open many opportunities in the world, I know that the good person are these that show a good attitude when you know it the first time, and something in your heart told you that you knew a good person. Everyone will have present that they can trust in you and they will feel great to know a person like you. The first impression is always a good one. Many people do not know me and they think that I am conceited just how I look like and they do no take the time to talk with me or just smile me. My point of view is each person need to empathize with everyone know more people try to make new friend but always show like we are.         "
2103,9DF267887BEB,"I disagree with this artical because is not always how you will see first impression is how you will see the person in general. Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Not all what you see is who it is sometime the apparance lies. People sometime lie to get something or someone. Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention.

Other people do it to get attention because they fell alone and they change to get attention. I sometime do it to but only because I fell left out of the group so sometime I act diffrent. I don't like it but is the only way that I can get people attention. Some people will like if they are them self because you don't what to date sameone and that person is not the person that you see in the pictur. Other people like to deceive other poeple only for the money, to play around with them or be bad with you.

Like for example I'm shy meeting new people but sometime I don't know what happen to me that I talk to people like I meet them before. Sometime when I act crazy is becasue I like someone or because I need sleep but most of the time is when I'm in love. I am very weird to be around. I like to jock a lot but that dosen't change me who am I.

Is not a great idea to change how you are to impres other people. There are sometime that you have to impres other poeple like when you are trying to get a job. You have to look impresing so they can higher you for the job. Sometime it will need more then changing who you are. But most of the time you don't have to impres the people with the look you can impres with how good you are with the job. "

Many people today likes give advises to others, sometimes about their life, work or personal relationship. But the question now is, ''Example is not the main thing in influencing others; is the only thing? I think it is, for two main reasons.

Fistly, When you talk to others, you sometimes gives a example about other people experiences. For example, someone who was a bad person in the past and now he change. You can change bad relations or yourself . You are influencing that person with reasons, examples and actions, he can change himself. If he wants.

Second, always we influenced people with reasons, maybe bad reasons or good reasons but is the only way to influence others. Influence people is not easy, you need to be prepared with the examples they need to ear.

In conclucion, the only way to influence people is with examples, actions, reasons and your personal advise. "
2559,BE28A2EEAE06,"There are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. Completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. it's the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsiblity on completing something. it teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. My favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. I think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family,talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. Even if you don't make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done.

The activity is enjoyable because my friends and I get to do experiments together as a group. We assign a person to do a different task so everyone can work. Our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom so she could get more organized. Doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. This activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment. These are the reasons why i think completing a science experiment is a enjoyable and educational activity."
1615,7ACF284A8B7C,"I think that work in groups is more benefit. Because work is groups make the class successful. also, the students can know each other and they can meet new people. therefore, work in groups is benefit for students and teacher. Here are some reason why

I think that work in groups is benefit.

First, They can divide the work in same parts. While someone is working in searching information the other one can think in how to make the work more creative. Also, if they divide the work is more fair for the group so they can have more opportunity to work successfully. Second, They have more opportunity to have a better work. If the class work in group they can do much better in the work that working alone because they can do the work more easily by working as a team. For example, If the class works in groups of 4 they can do a good work by dividing the work in same parts like one can be searching for information the other one can be looking for imagines. The other two can be checking that the writing is good and that the information is good. And the last one can make the presentation and make the work creative.

Second, In groups can take less time to work on it that working alone. If a group meet in one place and they start working they can easily finish the work on time. Also, they can search for information more faster then alone because they can divide the work but they can also help each other. Second, In a group decide what to do it can be hard. But when the group decide what to do and they finish the work fast. The group can check if the work is good or not and decide either to keep the information o to make some changes. So, the group can have more opportunity to have a better grade.

Third, Work as a group can also be fun because you are working with your friends or you can met new people. First, work in group can be a good for class because they can know each other. If the class meet each other the class can be more successful. Because there will not fight or enmity so the class can work more successfully. If a class is works more successfully that makes the topic easy and knowing each other makes the class more understanding. And, It will make the class more fun because everyone can help each other in thing that are hard for people. For example, if one student can't understand the topic he can ask for help to the teacher and he can ask to people around hem for help.

In conclusion, work as a group is funny and make the class better. Also, it makes the students to do better workers and meet people. therefore, I think that work will be better in groups because the class can meet and know each other and they can be better person and better students. This are some reasons why a think that work in groups is better."
3243,E231B7832E0C,"Energy and resources, are one the most very important things in the world. So we should all try to save it. If we waste both of them we can't live with out it. This is why most the countries doesn't have one them or both, because they spent more money on, doing other stuff like makin new buildings, restaurants and etc. Instead of that, we should be saving money on resources, so people can eat and save energy by turning most of the lights of just need to turn main lights on, beacuse in today's world companies make money of the people, by sending them extra bills eventhough they didn't use that much energy.

Schools are one the most places to waste more energy. It could change, if we have less school hours we could save energy. In my school i mostly see all the lights are on, if there is no class the lights should be turned of, this is one of the big reason. In most of my classes the lights are turned of, because we care about our school. My school mostly have all the resources, but we need to have more because more students are coming in from other countries. We should be taking care of our school, have it clean and dont waste. "
3878,FEA77A729AC3,"Imagine walking into a classroom full of children just glaring at you, ans you teaching them a lesson that they have never heard of. A lesson i would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why its's important to be active in life and it's,doing sports or or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym.

Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids don't have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie.

Eating healthy is very important, because you won't have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it won't make you gain alot of weight. In my opinion I think vegtables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives.

KIds should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for 10 minutes. Kids should lift dumbells also, becuase it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. Box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athlecticism and vertical. The gym is perfect for a exercise routine.

I would teach elementary students about sports and why they need to do it, because it could benefit your life, and going to the gym is an even greater way to stay in shape."
2258,A91E59572DA0,"Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays.

When we think about technology, social media comes related too. For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a 'new friend,' to then execute their real intentions. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media.

In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge.

Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. It's true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what it's true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and it's neccessary to learn how to manage them.

A solution for this problem could be in the parents' hands. Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kid's future.

After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. However, it's important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Moreover, we shouldn't let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more. "
1259,60E686BA1E09,"When people ask for advise, they usually don't know what path or choice to make.

When people make a wrong desition they can mess something up in their life. That can mean the world to them like a wife/husban or his/her kids. They can set a bad influence on small kids by going to jail or by doing something a criminal might do. That is why most people go to jail and don't come out for a very long long time. That sucks to not see your mom/dad for a very long time and that can be depressing on some people.

Then if they make a good choice they won't get in trouble or get in federal trouble. that can make a good influence on your childeren and that can give them a better futer in this world. If you talk to the right person that gives you good advise. That can be a very good choice for you and your family because they won't have to see you in jail through a little window.

Just what im saying is if you mess up by talking to the wrong person you can set a bad influence on people, more family and that would suck to see your chidren and wife through a little window in a prison trust me I have been through it all. if you get in bad trouble you can probubly fix it and just get a ticket, fin, or mistimener you can fix it dont make the wrong choice and get in trouble do what you think is the best for you and your family. Don't think bout other just worry bout you and your family not anybody else

Also if you do they can take your stuff, steal money, stab you in the back and also become an turn on you, a freind is a doller in your pocket and your pocket gots a hole my mom says that to me a lot. Just do what your heart says not other people because the can get you in a lot of trouble.

This is what can go good for you, if you make the right choice you can go to college and get a degree in something you like. You can get a good job and get a good house, good car and always have money on you just in case of anything. You also can help out your perents get a good house and you won't have to put them in a home and you can also bye what your kids want when ever they wan't and you won't have to go through the bad stuff in the world like most people go through to put food on the table."
2407,B312F104B015,"I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you

Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.

The benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.

There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.

Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.

By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students.           "

Not being active its not good nor healthy, and It wouldn't help you progress in future reference. it helps you to be more prepare and organize and. ready for everything. Always have a mindset goal, realistic goals, and measurable.

We do Accomplish more if we're doing something, keeping yourself occupied. Sometimes when you're not doing nothing, (meaning) being inactive, It's to rest for an amount of time. To think and, analize our point of views and,ideas.

""Determine to never be Idle"" (meaning lazy) I know there's time when we all want to be lazy and not doing nothing, but thats not get you no where near your Goals. As Thomas Jefferson said "" It's Wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing"".

Thomas Jefferson has an amazing point with this Qoute.

This qoute Has alot of meanful information behind it, and i think everyone

Has a their own way to learns about it.

Not any person create a good qoute mostly, Qoute are written or said by people Whom were Famous , or made a great impact in our world, and, they're always going to be remember as the person and their story. This is all i have to say about my prompt."

I think the best and awesome policy is policy number 1 , because the students need their cell phones to call their family members to pick them up. I see a lot of students use there phones in class, but maybe if you give them other free times to use it they may not use it during class periods. Having to use phones in your own free time is not a bad idea, but need to remember to turned off their phones in class.

704,36035C063AB3,"Can many things be done if we are always doing? succeed comes with hard work and hard comes with trying, but everyone has different opinions and points of views. Although others believe otherwise, there is always something new to learn in this world, we can influence others for the better, and we can accomplish more if we are always ready to keep doing something.

I believe the world has plenty of things and places we have not yet explored, learned about or have seen before. Everywhere you go, you learn a something new about someone or something; it could be a new culture, places in the world or even a new language, but that is only if you keep doing. For example, I was born in Generic_City and when I came here for the first time everything was new to me. Starting from seeing different faces to a completely new language, I kept trying to learn more and more about the United states because that is how you keep on doing more and not stopping your learning process. When i first went to school here i was afraid and very shy, but that did not stop me from learning the language and sure i learned something new every day because there was so much to explore all around. That is why I believe that there is something new to try and learn everywhere you go. If you encourage yourself to keep doing, you would not believe all the things you can do for yourself. Which those things sometimes can help you improve yourself and the way you view different things as well.

If you keep doing and learning more, you can absolutely influence others for the better. You can teach others from the mistakes you have made from trying new things and from all the experiences you have had before as well. Someone that I look up to as my role model is my older sister, because she taught me how to be the strong young women I am today. She influenced me for the better, because of what she has been through before me. One thing she taught me that was very important to me is to not give up on my goals and my mindset from the beginning. She once told me that people will doubt me no matter who they are, and one of those people was my mother. My mom taught that my sister and I would not even get to college, but here I am as a junior in high school and my sister about to graduate college. A day never went by without my sister reminding me of how strong and independent I can be if i keep trying and keep learning because the world is full of things to learn from, good or bad. My sister had to keep learning and was always trying to do something new, because she new she could influence me for the better so i could learn from her mistakes. There is always gonna be someone out there with advice for you and to influence you for the better, but if you keep learning and trying nothing is impossible. Influencing others can be very important, mostly for the younger generation. They look up to us now and it should be an honor to show them the rights from the wrongs but that is only possible if you try to have a good mindset of always wanting to be a better person and knowing what you want. Never stop trying to learn new things because there will always be something out there to learn from and to look at it from a different point of view.

Accomplishing a goal can be very hard sometimes and even makes you wanna give up but that is something you should not do. If you are always doing and trying new things you can accomplish so much more than you would ever imagine you could. My goal was to learn English, go to school, and graduate all to prove my parents and my older sister i could. I accomplished part of my goals so far and that makes me feel very proud of myself because i feel like i am slowly accomplishing my goals in a short period of time. When i was younger and until now i have always liked books and that is something that helped me learn English and to improve my learning techniques in school as well. I have not yet graduated but that is a goal that i am maintaining and that i know i will accomplish soon, but the only way that will happen is if i keep doing and learning more every time i possibly can. You may have people who doubt you or who do not want to see you succeed but you should never let them control your mindset and the way you do things. A positive mindset always comes with a positive outcome, and always surround yourself with good people because we are here to make good things happen to each other. But keeping your mind open to new things will always help you learn more everyday and have new experiences too.

You just need to believe in yourself and understand that there is so much more out there that you could not know about, and that it is always good to encourage yourself to go out there and try things you have never tried before. always influence others for the better and accomplish all your goals no matter how hard it can get, because at the end of the day every good thing you do will absolutely pay off later on when you least expect it or see it coming. In conclusion I believe Thomas Jefferson's quote is very true because of all the wonderful things we can learn, experiences we can have, and things we can accomplish with time if we keep on doing."
914,46302B93EF09,"Dear Generic_Name,

I know you're still a little young to understand what technology means ,but I believe that technology has had a negative impact on us. Technology has increased the rates of kidnapping, human trafficking ,sexual abuse ,and murder.

Due to technology we are also losing our eye sight. It has also limited our communication skills .

Young adults usually download dating apps to meet new people ,but they don't understand the risk they can get them self into. For example they usually meet someone online and start talking. After awhile the guy probably ask her out on a date to go for a dinner ,and of course the girl is going to say yes because she's interest in the guy. Few days later the guy ask her out on another date to go and watch a movie ,but he say's that he's going to pick her up; and that were it all start she get in the car thinking he going to take her to the movies ,but instead he's taking her somewhere else he's going to kidnapping her and she doesnt know. she goes missing for weeks and no one knows where she's at. A few days later they find her body dead.

Now in day more and more people are using glasses. Technology is ruining our eye vision. People that work in offices are more likely to be using glasses now in day. They sit all day looking that their computer ,but they don't realize that their eye sight is getting bad. Young adults are also using glasses too because they use their phone to much or watch to much TV . One way to prevent that is you could put your light dimer on your computer and phone. You could also set your self a limit for how long you're going to use your phone or computer.

Another reason why technology is bad because it limits our communication skills. More people are getting used to working independently. Teacher will usually give us a project assignment; we can either work with a partner or work independently. Most students like to work independently because they don't like to rely on someone else finishing the part they had to work on for the project and not doing it. We are also able to text or video chat with other people instead of talking to them in person. By talking to someone in person it can also increase your self esteem.

In conclusion these are my reason why I believe that technology is not good for us. Technology has impacted us a lot in society. We need to be more careful and caution about the new technology we are going to be inventing in the future. we also need to be careful with the action we take. No one can predict what going to happen in the future."
1487,72A69C1B34A8,"I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a students picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it everyday. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have no dought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it.

Although if the counclours put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own.

in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. The students will become positive and get good grades because they made a decision that could possibly impact their future goals. "
3539,F093FCEEC17E,"How does technology impact our life in a positive way? Some people argue; that technology is creating a division between us. I believe the appropriate use of technology does not divide, or limit human contact. If we give a good use to it, we will have great benefits. Besides, technology improves communication skills, helps parents, and facilitate jobs.

Research has proved that technology has been a useful tool for communication skills. This is shown in the facility that we have now at making a call, or video call to another country. It has improve communication for people who are speechless, defeat or just shy. All of them has problem at talking or listening, but with technology this is getting over. And they are interacting in certain way with other people. To sum up, technology is improving communication in different ways.

Parents always have many things to do. Passing time with their children is not easy; however, technology is making easier it. Now parents can work from home; this is giving them the opportunities to share more time in family. Also, for parents that work out new machines are helping them to finish quickly. Although, new phones schedule appointments and others for them, in order to be organize. In resume technology is giving the opportunities to spend time in family to parents.

In centuries before how many time does a writer spend writing a book? Technology has being a helpful tool for years; long time ago a writer spend one year writing a book by hand, now they just spend 3 to 4 months writing a book in a computer. New technology give us a lot of opportunities like:

We do not work all days, We get a good pay, and We do not work in the sun shy. In resume, technology is facilitate our life.

In conclusion, technology is a wonderful tool that let us develop our communication skills, unify families, and makes easier our jobs. People who does not have skill of listing or talking; they can still communicate their selves. families now are more unify. Jobs now are more easy. I believe technology is having a good effect for those who use it appropiately."
2602,C1314085435C,"I agree with Ralph waldo Emerson because he say that if you try to do something you will never grow and that mean you can't do anything with Emerson. but that is not possible to do that if he say that the people will be scared with that thing but if I agree with Emerson he can do something about opinion and the people they can do the other opinion and to understand, and how we can agree with other, we can agree something is very important Emerson he can need to stop how to agree or to take out if we do agree we can do each ether. and we can grow we can stay down, he can keep it up not down if will be down how that will be not grow that need to grow is not to stay down.

The person can agree and he can't do any opinion but he can understand the opinion that he agree. he suppose to agree because there are people they agree and they grow the people have experiences.

Emerson he suppose to agree and people will come to agree with him if is not that the people will not be able to agree with him and that is good to grow, agree is opinion of the people and correspondence the people they have experience to agree and he need to be experiences to other people. Emerson he has a opinion for something he agree and he can do whatever he know but that is not great if you have some ideas you need to took and we can agree each other with other people if we don't know it we can tell with other people they know how they can agree the think we have to agree and that will be good for other people they can say that was very good to agree.

1813,88966ED00A28,"This program will help both with the older and younger student because, the older student have more experience then younger student.

The older students knows a lot of things more than younger students because the older student knows how to read, knows how to do math, and knows science and social study. But, sometimes older student might forget about things that they were taught in elementary school.

Also, there's some new ways that the elementary student are taught in a different ways because it would make it easier for the younger student to understand it more, or the younger student is taught something new and they can help the older student understand what this new idea is, and the older student teach new things for them to know and be papered.

When the older student teach the younger students, they want to papered them because when they start a new unit and the younger student heard of what the unit is about, they know and understands them and will get good grades,and the older students wants the younger student to be papered for next year or this year, also the older student wants the younger students to improve their grades and their test grades.

When the school have a program that pairs older student and the younger student, it helps them because they have new ideas and they know a lot of new different subject that the older students don't know about the subject or a equation. Also, they can bond and tell them how it's like being a kid now days, and the older student tells their stories about their childhood and what it was like being a kid in the past. The older and younger student have different experience with their childhood and their elementary, which they can help with each other and the program for the older and younger student will help them improve their skills and their grades.

1549,770541C6A2C1,"Would you like to start your life early?

Graduating is a privilege in general for everyone. Most find it very very important if you want to succeed in life and make great money. on the other hand some many not and find it important and waste of time. I think everyone who doesnt find it important should really think twice. Yes I understand that some classes are better than others, but its all required for one to graduate.

In my opinion i support both sides of the story. Some people want to start their life early some do not. Even if you wanted to graduate early its a challenge. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. its nice to graduate early because if one goes to college they see that and they think best of you.

On the other hand i do not think it's a good a idea to graduate early. Only if you have the right skills and capability for it. Gradating early is not for everyone some struggle in the normal four standard years of high school. It is not a requirement at all. High school is not a race its preparing you for your future its good to take all the time you need maybe if need to stay in extra year or two.

In conclusion like I said ""I support both sides"" it is not necessary to graduate nor is it a requirement. Graduating early is only for those who already want to go to college or go into the work force. Graduating in the normal four years is grate if you dont know what your going to be yet after high school. There is never no rush. Always take your time its your future. "
751,39BB85E5CB5A,"have you ever thought of just staying after school just to finish your homework, and wish not to do work at home when you can relax at home without thinking and stressing about doing your homework instead of remembering that you did it after school, that's why I think it's a good idea to have an, after school club because then the students will take advantage to finish there homework. and get help from and get more specific direction or other things that students need help on.

So, i think if students go to after school club to finish there homework, etc then the students won't have to worry about it at home and keep there grades in good shape. Also to keep it simple it's important to have something important like this (after school club) to let the students know they have after school to help them complete there homework.

And then, if students need help on completing there homework, etc then the students can come to after school to get the help they need. And create a bond with other students by helping each other.

therefore i think there should be a after school club to help, do, and support. 3 gt"
352,1A56FC79C084,"Positive attidude is key to success in life. This should the people who have a good attitude can be help the society to improve, and I agree with this statement but most people have a bad attitude and they need to change, because if they have positive attitude they can be have a good life with the family, better in the job, and can be to improve the life of the others person.

The people who have positive attitude if good with the family to improve a condition society, or help to the change they attitude. For example, the majority of the person does not have patience with the childrens, or the familty and least the society. For this many of the people need to improve they attitude, and outgrow the bad desicion they take in the life. Because if they have a bad attutude they can not help the family, or the other person when they needy. nevertheless many of them attempt change the attitude because they know the change it correct for have a better life with the family and the society.

If the people have a good attitude can better in the jod, when make the work with the other people, or when a customer make a question and can be reply with a smile and kindly. For example, in many jod some employee have a bad attitude because when someone asking a question this people reply irate, and the customer irete too, for the attitude of the employee. This should that people need to have patience not only with the customer, or family need to have a positive attitude with everyone. However, if employee have patience, and some customer go in with the bad attitude and speak very bad the employee can contain and respond the same manner. Truly, the people need learn to control the attitude for can be better in the jod.

A person who have a good attitude can be change the other people life, because if helping to take better decision in the school, jod, or treat the improve the attitude with others. For example, in the school the teachers try to change the attitude of the students can be more better, and taht they respent others teachers and students. This should that teachers want to the students improve they life, because when they can be adults that have a better attitude, can be take better decision. After they graduate they can be work in a good jod has positive attitude, respent the customer, help their family with they needy, and have a good condition society. In theory, the people need to have a person who have a positive attitude for be better.

Positive attidude is key to success in life. Can be improve the relathionship with the family, or the society. Many of them has a good job because they respent the boss, customer, and the others employee.

You guys as young kids, should follow these life lessons I will tell you. The first one is you when your older do you want to have a good job have good money? You will always respect others,yourself and properties.

It's really important to follow those lessons because when your interviewing for a job or something like that you are gonna use those rules and life skills and show that your responsible and care about your future. when your going out with your friends like heading to the movies your gonna show the workers respect and kindness. Kindness is another example of a lesson. That my family always taught me and others as well bacause they know others like it when you give them respect. When your older people are gonna realize how respectful you are and mature you are. "
295,15BDA0989B56,"When you trying to make something different every day, is the greatest accomplishment.

I'm agree about Emerson's Statement !

Well, when you be yourself you every moment want to be something else,something new to know how capacity you have to be yourself. When you thinking in yourself your days be more easy, fun, you enjoy yourself in a world because you are only in the world nobody is like you, you are the only who make the better decisions in your life and is something constantly trying to make you something else because is the most and greatest accomplishment that you have is like a gift that your received and you need to care.

When you constantly trying to make you something you learn something that you don't know; something that surprise you because you never think that you can do, and you say I can do that thing and I want to experiment more things spontaneous because is better when that things have spontaneous because left better and so cool and impressive to you. Experiment more things new help you to be better every moment, to that these for you can helped an others persons when they need our help, when meet with one situation where somebody need help motivate that he or she can do it nothing is impossible, because a lot of peoples in the world don't believe in their self because all that time suffrage bullying they thing that they don't serve for nothing they believe in that bad words, is for these reasons that one situation appear in front of our eyes helped, spoke with love,respect,be courteous because when you spoke with one persons that have these problems where suffrage bullying, bad words that others peoples say they feel miserable have hatred,resentment and all of times they don't want to talk, you need or our need to going to these peoples and spoke with love, love is one of the most good gun that we have is the most important in that around world. A lot of peoples suffrage depression, anxieties, contempt, and racism, and to much peoples lose their lives because they don't support all that bad words,contempt and racism they suicide about that bad situation that they pass, is not necessary to arrive to these situation when we can change that world, stop to that bullying,racism we need to stay up, help these peoples and to these form too we be better persons these help too to our lives to see all that things different and get a solution because nothing is impossible when you purpose to me a good and better person.

Is time to care yourself, is time to listen your heart, yours words, and be better for yourself not for that others peoples, is time to return to be you for make that things that you want for you,don't make things for that others peoples see, want at have happy peoples, made because you want to continue with you life, dreams, expectations, careers, and because these make that you feel happy, interesting, confident, sure, cute, fun, and enjoy your victory. We need to get that goods words specific when it's for important persons because they want that better things for you, you don't need to get the bad words that you need to put in the trash so to these form that bad words don't affect you in nothing in your life. Then when you need to be something don't tell to everybody because a lot of time that peoples have envious yours victories then they get a angry things because have zealous that you did it. The important things spoke with that persons that really is important to you that person helped you to celebrate later your victory with you.

Make your things individuality because that work that you doing left good and you have your owns opinions,strategies,problems,situation,statements,solutions you work better when you work individually, like these work on me, when a work individuality I have my owns ideas because when a work in groups I feel that a can't put all my ideas a need to put all that ideas together and them we need to decide for one of the ideas the most interesting and important ideas, for me is better when you work individuality.

Trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplished, bec a use you can learn and make a new thing,because every day our want to change the world with all bad expectations, etc we need to care whatever word that we spoke to don't hurt nobody with any word all persons in all of world needed be different because a lot kids in these time what make whatever they want don't want to make that parents say that is something that we need to change.

Yourself is something that need to care because these defined what type of people you are, the values that you have, is something delicate and important; You need to have persons that helped you to be better every moment in your life,person who import good things on you, how stay with you in (bad & good) moments that person you want the best for you, who was happy when you get the victories because that is that things that you received and help you to make that same things with that person,we need to know who really is our friend.

-

Friend is who really want to support you how really wants good things for you that friends is that care you to do the true and better things.

Friend is not who don't help you, how don't care that important things for you that not be friends. All need to see very true who is really a friend.

Yourself is something happiness is like a emotional thing that you can share with your family, friend, that important persons for you, in yourself you feel a comfortable with you body because a lot of persons don't feel good with their body and suffrage for these. When you are sure with yourself and believe and yourself you feel happy,emotion, is something that we need to care a lot for no feel bad when a person who don't want to our things that we are doing.

3147,DDD3771E1DF6,"Many people believe that they do not need advises from others in order to take decisions in their life,and they believe they should take their own decisions. I do not agree with them. It is important to listen what other people think about it. Each person is different in a special own way and someone else might help you to solve your problem. I believe people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because they may have a better idea,or they may have been in the same situation before.

One of the main reasons is that other people may have been there before and they may know what to do. For example, You are undecided about taking swimming classes or piano classes,and you know you are a great swimmer,but you've also wanted to play piano since you were 6 years old. Your brother have been in that situation before, and he thinks that you should take piano classes from Monday to Wednesday after school, and swimming classes every Friday after school, but you have to work from Thursday to Sunday;then he says that you should take piano classes every Monday and Wednesday after school ,and Swimming classes every Tuesday after school .You believe that is what best suits for you.

Another reason is that other people might have a better or different idea than yours. Another example is that your parents give you two choices: going to Canada for spring break or going to The Bahamas for Christmas break. Generic_Name,your best friend have already visited those places and she tells you to go to Canada because she knows you love extreme low temperatures .You tell your parents that you've decided to go to Canada and once you are there you realize that it was the best decision you've taken. Thanks to your friend's advise;you are enjoying your trip,and you are glad that you asked for her opinion.

On the other hand,letting others influence on the decisions you take is not always the best thing to do. A simple example can be that you go to the mall and decide to buy a pair of shoes but you do not know what color to choose, so you ask your sister and she thinks that the red pair is the best for you; you buy it and when you get home, you realize that you do not like those shoes. The first thing you would probably do is blame on her because she told you to buy the red pair, but if you take that decision by yourself and you regret for the decision you make; You cannot blame on somebody else except for you.

In conclusion, people who seek guidance from their family,experts, or authorities are most likely to take the right decision. All persons sometimes may need an advise from someone on what to do, or if they should follow their own instincts; but the one who will make the decision is you, so do not blame on others for the decisions you make. Humans are not perfect and we do not always take the best decisions in our life; but with help from others , we will be able to make them right and move on."
1232,5F67A5D3DBB0,"I think students, parents, and including me wouldn't like the idea of adding a hour and half of a hour each day of the school thats why I disagree with the idea of extending the day of school because students have other things to do like pick up little brothers or sisters and take of them, help mom and dad with the house, do another type's of activities because if students are only thinking about school all the time we can stress out a lot and there's no rule that says that students can't have fun also we are in school for about 7 or 8 hours so i think thats enough.

First of all some of the students have little brothers and sisters and the parents work and they dont have the chance to pick up they kids because they get out of the work late, so the orders sibling haves to take care of they little brothers and sisters also little kids from elementary schools can't get out of the bus without someone picking them up, so the older siblings have to pick them up or else the little kids are going back to school and they get scared because they are the only one who are in the school and they are little so they don't know what's going on so that is one reason why we cant be in school more hours not even half of a hour.

Secondly students have to help they parents with the house how i said parents came from work late and they dont have time for nothing so students have to help them by cleaning the house, cook for they sibling and parents , they have to wash the dishes, wash they clothes, clean the rooms, some of the students have dogs and they have to go with them for a walk or take them to the doctor so when parents get home they can lay down and chill because they work really hard and all the students can do is helping doing the cleaning that is the second reason why we can't be at school more than we supposed to be.

Finally some students have another type of activities after school like dancing, soccer practice and soccer game's, basketball practice and basketball game's, step teams, community service, etc also that helps a lot to get your mind out of thinking about homework's, test's, classwork, so you dont stress out a lot because being honest sometime students have a lot of homework and test to do in each class and after school is the only time where you can get you'r mind out of school and also we are having fun for a little time because some parents are kind off strict and they don't let they kids to be outside after 8:30.

In conclusion we can't be in school more than 8 hours because all the students have more activities to do and have fun for a little time and we have responsibilities at home helping parents cleaning and taking care and picking up little siblings and we can stress out a lot if we spend more than 8 hours in school because that means more work to do and we would be only student and we would be tired because also we are not going to have time to chill and i know that no one is going to be happy about it because teachers have they children as well parents need the help of they kids and students need they own time so these are my reasons of why I disaree of adding a hour and half of a hour.

2151,A0B8C1FA3811,"I think the students should not be allow to use their cell phone in classroom, the effects of allowing them is not going to be useful comparing to how it will take their attention from their class work to the online world of cell phone. The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that .

Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom.

Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classroom's people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time.

Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need.

Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that it's, because that would wast all class's time, and students have more options to search online for their class work.

We all must respect people's, teachers', and our time in classroom by not use cell phone to distract and lose the attendances' benefit in classroom."
134,0A8B8F282E45,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, sometimes failure teach us how to get at the success. Many people agree with this statement, others disagree with it. It's easy to see both sides, but one stand out. Success is necessary consists of going from failure because failure teach us how to be better and create responsibility.

First, failure teach us how to be better, for example if I did a song to someone important to see and this person didn't like it; I won't give up even if is the worse song ever because the failure will show how to learn better and if you wont give up and always try the best you will get the success. As you can see you always have to do your best to get your success even if is the hardest thing. however, most of the famous had failure. it wasn't easy to get where they are; maybe can take long time to be like they are, but is hard. Most of the times is difficult to get the success that they have; they have that success because they never give up even if was the worse song or if they were failure.

Next, failure make you create responsibility, for example if you are a failure on something and want to be better, you always will try something new to get better and try your best, that's mean responsibility to yourself,

for example if I want to get my drive license and I fell many times, I can be a failure on it, but if I create responsibility and study every day I will do good and pass with success. If I speak another language and my

English is a failure I will be responsive and study to understand the people and do well on my classes. As you can see, always have a way, we learn with failure to be better then you were

On the another hand, some people believe we never have to have failure in our success, because failure can a negative in your life and in your life you always have to be have to be positive; this point make sense, but in life we always have to learn something. Therefore this statement is right because success consist of going from failure.

In conclusion, many people think that success don't consists of going from failure because it's a negative thing in our life, but success is necessary consist going from failure, because failure teach how to get the success in life, how to be better, and how to be more responsive in life."
1254,60AE13D3F07B,"I think our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed. As children begin to go to school, most often they meet other kids and become friends. Friends also have an influence on how traits are formed like for example: Kindness, friendly, honest, and more. The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm. These traits for formed because of school and my friends. John Lubock mentions that ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I think that this quote explains that you are able to choose it by yourself. I disagree and I believe that other humans make our character traits."
3314,E56D4253DFE7,"I think to extending the school day two hours, that can be something bad, because not all students agree with that, and also that can be something complicated. To all student because we can be out to late.

That's why I think that expending the school day two hours is something not very good. For some students are very complicate to extending the school day two hours. Because some student have to work in the afternoon,

and others have to do others thing.

I think the benefits and disadvantage to a four-day school week, can be good, but also can be sad.

Becauase not everyone is agree with all this that happens in the school, a four-day school week have good ideas and bad ideas. For the disagvantage is that we can be out so late, and that is something that not everyone liked, and the benefits is that is only four-day per week. But the benefits is that all students only come four-day per week. And i think is better get out early, because some student have something to do, and get out so late is not a good idea for all students.

Some student can be not agree with all this, that extending the school for two hours. Beacuse I think that is not a good idea for all the students, and that can effect because if they working in the afternoon. That's why "
882,441097905601,"Dear Principal,

I would like to tell you about how I think about doing community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others. In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time. I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service and I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.

2110,9E4F43374DD5,"Do you think that school students should have at least participate in one or more extracurricular activity, agree or disagree. I think that students should participate in one or more school extracurricular activity. here are some of my reason on why i think that student should participate in a school activity.

I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be wont be bored all the time anymore. school can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. sport can make you keep in good shape and good health.

school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity but it also depends on what clubs you chose. like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school.

after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.                                                  "
1393,6B479AF72202,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their belivers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots.

Here are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. First, the world is trying to make change but you have to never have to give up. Becuase it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. It's important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, don't forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are someting else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplisment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be.

Finally what are you waiting for!. Don't let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and don't forgot your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greastest accomplisment."
3787,FA9EEE4BF0AD,"In some societies, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. They want to make sure you have the classes you need in order to acheive your career . The career that you will be giving to the counsouler will be befetional. After the graduation you will easily take the classes that you wanted.

firstly, I think it is good idea to identify your career before entering to high school. When you submitting your application to the high school, they will look at the classes that you need to graduate. If you plan your career from a young age, you will achieve your career very strong and easily. In order to have a successful life you need a good career. The plan which you Will be thinking , or taking will show a how organize you are.

secondly,Try to talk with someone who have experiences in this types of problems. When you talk to someone they will be giving you some advises to help you during your high school time. For example: When you want to take the classes you need to take , or you have to take, but they give you useless classes you do not need for graduation. If you want to go to a law school, then you need to take social study ,or government but when you do not commit your plan of career they will give some useless classes like Photography, Independent living and Art which you do not need for law school.

Thirdly,It is very important to have a good education in this day and age. You do not need to waste time of your life in classes you do not need. We have to try our best to be organized. You have to think about your future ,and consciousness that will be coming to you. There is multiple ways to began your career, solve problems , and finally acheive your career.

In conclusion, you need to have an idea or a career about what do you want be in future. You need to commit or tell your teacher about what do you need in order to graduate from high school. We need to put effort to acheive something that can make us happy and our family. Try our best to solve any problems we have in a good way or talk to someone. "
3497,EEE7731E8A57,First need to plan your work and need to be organized and have good details about what you need to read and need to wright. All what you have in your head just wright it all on paper first or then wh en your weighting your book or story you will have everything in copy and can read it to make sure its good. Like to best teachers told me Generic_Name and Generic_Name if you wright something on paper you will always be right or in the right path to do good on your book. Always need to wright your work what happens if you brake your computer but you have it on paper so your teacher can just grade your paper. Paper is the best way to get your work and plan it out because they are your opinions and computer it changes the words to what it wants to change it to. Next you need to be organized if your organized you can read your work fast and so can the teachers if your work is neater your can do it faster because you read it and if you don't have time to finish pages in your computer you can tarn the paper but not on the computer thing. Then if its organized you can use the same paper for next time but change some words or change the whole paper. you will need to do more work then just taring in the paper and not on the computer. Late you always need to be organized. After always finish you weighting dont leave it have way done just finish it to get done with the work you have to do because if you dont you will have to do way more work then what you have to get done just do your work on time. The end you will have to have everything done by the do date you have in school then you will do the rest of more work you have to get it done just do it.
3019,D840D9ED669C,"Do we accomplish always doing something, that quastion can be answerd in different ways on the tipe of person that you ask; theres people that are accomplished with what they do, but theres people that not like to do their stuff because maybe they do not like to do what they are doing, or its hard to do it or they are just tired of it. For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example:

The space are were they work at.

The relation ship that they have with other workers to work together .

How hard is the job that they are doing that makes them feel comfrontable.

In the other heand the people that do not like what they do, they don't feel accomplish for this reasons for examole:

The work area is not comfortable to them.

The people do nt have a good relation ship with the workers.

The work is to hard since no one likes to help echader.

In my way of think I would pick that i feel accomplish with what I'm doing because maybe is hard or I dont feel comfrontable odoing it, but I enjoi doing it is something that i considere accomplihsment for; Im the one who is doing it that nothing is going to change it and Thomas Jefferson was right it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing it.

My conclution is that if we have to enjoy what we are doing even if is something that we dont like to do, or is just a person that you are working with is not good enght to work with , but it doen's not matter about what you do your idias that you have made the work that they did and the prgres that could be helpfull to expire you to do more thing to feel accomplished with your self."
2438,B543953F757A,"When I think about and enjoyable activity, I think about sports, and the reason why it's because a lot of people find sports as a fun way to be healthy and make them feel better of them self by being physically active, I also believe that any sport is a good example to learn from others as well as your self, and for I know sports is not all of just about competing against other teams and winning or loosing, is very helpful if we're talking of team work.

One of the most enjoyable activities in the world it's sports, in some way many different kind of sports have proof that it's a really entertainment thing to do and to be as much healthy then doing a diet from a doctor's recommendation, people actually agree that if there's something that might have a plethora of fun and includes a reason to be healthy in daily life it's sports,a 78 % of people in planet Earth consider and invited people to joying a sport for the good of others and good of your self too.

Sport it's a specific activity that in cases have help people feel better about who they are, how they look, and the way it has change people globally, most of the time a person doesn't know what they like to do even thought they try other stuff like being smart, video games, music etc,

they feel like they don't belong or fit in something, but at the end they go along about what other friends says about sports and find them self the right place to be.

Sports as a good educational activity example of learning about others as learning from your self, is very important when getting a job that consist in the statement of knowing other people, like being a teacher, a teacher doesn't get a job without presenting him/her in general to his/her teachers partner, or teach a class without presenting to the students in classes they'll be taking, they will also ask a new student to present him/her self to every one in the classroom,teachers mostly do with their classroom as a coach will do with his team in a sport.

These two educational activities are alike to each other in the simple reasons that they both teach their learners to get to know each other and get along with one another, another way that they're alike is that they're preparing them for the big challenges, a English teacher prepared the students for the big writing SOL as a soccer coach prepared the players for the final game of the season.

However it's not only learning from others, many times sports definitely let you learn more about yourself, it takes out the person who you truly are it will also take all those stuff that you had no idea you new, doing sports can have experiences in which you'll learn from.

Team work is the hard work that a group does together to complete their goal, it's not about the leader or the best member of the group, what most matter in team work is work as a group no matter the worst or best you do.

If you ever play a sport you might know that the main thing to do is team work, for example football,if one of the football players has the ball, he can't go across the field and do a touch down if his team mates don't do anything to stop the defenders of the other team that wants to knock him out,but if they decided to play the game by doing team work he would of made a touch down because he's team mates would of help him pass through by knocking the defenders.

Sports team around the whole world has a immense number of followers, followers keep on touch with them because they have something relative to it or because they had won a lot of times,and this is thanks to the strategy they do ( team work ),

In conclusion sports are not only of competing against others, is something that is productive in the way that you don't only get a metal or a good job, sports are also to have fun with friend or even with people you don't know, and it's a really good way of being healthy and be able to do two things at the same time, it also help us understand other people that needs it as you do with your team mates by knowing them and getting along with them, in sports you can learn from your self when you make a mistake, and finally in any kind of sport you will have to know how to play as team work because that's what matters in teams.

There is a lot of other educational an enjoyable tings to do but I think sports are one of the best ones."
3759,F9C96F25D515,"Spain is one of the most beautiful place in this world. Spain has lots of stuff, they have big soccer clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Athletico Madrid, and many more. They have big stadiums that whole over 100,000 people, they even have some nice features like they have have restruants inside the stadium, one of them has a bedroom inside.

Once I would arrive at Spain I would love to try their food because I heard their food was good sou

I sesrched it up and the food looks so yummy and tasty. I would also love to ride on a boat and cruise through the city. One of the good things is that it's hot most of time over there.

Barcelona is a beautiful city in Spain, they speak Catalan. Most of Spanish people would only speak Spanish but with an accent but Barcelona speaks Spanish and Catalan. That would one the languages i would love to learn. Spain has alot of great cities like Generic_City, Generic_City, Generic_City, and a whole bunch more. They each have a stadium.

The last place I would love to visit is the capital of Spain which is good. Generic_City is one of the best soccer team in the world. They have a lot of great players and a Big stadium."
572,2B9C5C3BB7B9,"Studies have shown that there is a 25% higher passing rate from students that attend to online classes. If it wasn't for the advance tecnology the world has today there wouldn't be things like online schools. Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptop's , computer's , gaming system's and their smart tv's.

Now with this new technology the school systems' have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes.

Some would say that online classes would not benefit students i'd say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefit's way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free she'd finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when she'd finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together.

The people that say that online classes aren't beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here' an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes won't have to worry about those issuses.

Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention.

Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free.

Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students

8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house.

In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples i've given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank. I've given all tmy examples and details also personal storys on the benefits of online school that is all i have to offer fairwell."
2148,A0A56F7995D6,"I disagree with the statement about a positive attitude is the key to success in life because there's others things you need to be success in life anyone can have a positive attitude and they are not success or probably won't be, theres only few percent of people in this world that are success there are some people that dont have a positive attitude and they are success in life.

For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life but they cant they keep trying, trying and nothing happens. now some people with a bad attitude are success they dont even have to try to work hard to be success.

Image how many people work hard and hard every day just be success in life, but theres a couple of people that have a positive attitude and they are success in life basically living life great, there are people people that dont have a positive attitude they just do bad things to be success. now doing bad things is not right because you can be success for a while. for example it can be stealing or drugs if you are dong those things you will be success but is not a right choice for you and you keep doing it one day you will have to pay for what you did, most people prefer to work hard every day to be able to have at least everything, I prefer people to do the right thing because doing bad is not going to get you anywhere you might be success but it wont be forever id rather work hard so i can be success in life "
2415,B37D0A9D7859,"Do you have a positive attitude? I agree with this statement about the importance of a positive attitude. Being positive is the key to being successful in life, I think having a positive mind can help us in our bad circumstances of life and help us overcome bad time faster. Having a positive attitude will give allow you to have a good days. Others may think you do not have to have a positive attitude in order to be successful.

Having a positive mindset will always help you get better opportunities, for example to get a better job or a better home or a better car, but everything requires that you have a positive mindset.

Also having a positive mind will always help you to be better every day every time you overcome a bad situation you will become stronger or also every time you reach a goal, that will help you be better.

Sometimes it is also necessary to be negative to understand or experience bad things or it can also help you be prepared for bad things, or also bad news or bad times. We have to try to be positive most of the time to be able to make good decisions and have better opportunities, but also being negative can help us make better decisions for ourselves.

Different from how I think, people say if you are smart, why do I need a positive attitude? They believe someone can be successful just knowing the skills. There are those that believe if, you work harden than most you can be successful.

In closing, it is my belief if you have a positive attitude you will have a successful and rewarding life. A positive mind will give you better opportunities, and great energy. It is not good to have a negative attitude. People think you only need to be smart in order to be successful, but it is nice to be positive too."
634,306796D0279E,"I disagree with this statement because people can show the oppositive to the attitude they showed before. And they can show no a good way at the first time for some good reasons; maybe they are shy, or have had bad experiences with a good group of people.

Sometimes the people can think a person who saw for the firsrt time and saw he or she needed help and the person didn't help is because the person did't want to help but is because the person is no extrovertive and think is no a good idea to ask.

Sometimes a person says ""Hi"" with a good tone to a person who saw for the for the first time and the person respons with no a good tone and the happens the same thing with other person, then the person no is kind like before, and when see other person doubt if say ""Hi"" with a good tone, and when they are meeting each other the other person relize the person was so kind before.

1324,6586DF43A92D,"I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed."
2627,C2D061782462,"If you're afraid that you're going to hurt someone's feelings by telling the truth don't be afraid to tell that person the truth. Being honest can lead you to many benefits and help you in many ways right now and in the future too. When being honest, people will start trusting you with a lot of things. But you've got ot be careful with what you do or say. You can get a lot of good benefits in life. A benefit of telling the truth all the time is building new friendships and meeting new people.

On the other hand, people will have that mindset thinking that being honest is a bad thing. As you start lying more often, it can become a bad habit which you might regret later in life. Now if there's a case where you're trying to tell the truth, those same people that you have been lying too won't believe you. A negative effect that can ruin you is like losing friendships or losing a job based on the way you've been acting. Also, being dishonest can make people think that they can't trust you. Those people that you're lying too might think you're a bad person.

You can show integrity to lots of people which can be by listening to them and telling them the good and the bad. Think of yourself like a role model to other people and having a positive mindset. If you show integrity, people will start looking up to you. Also, have a good explanation to the reason why you're lying to that person, well that's if they find out one day. Besides, if you had a good reason for lying that other person might forgive you. But let me tell you this as a tip so you won't make a mistake and regret it ""think before you speak"", if you don't do that it can lead you to many consequences."

Trying new things helps you to understand that you can do more things,everything depends on you if you really wants to do something that you like, just do it , never do the opinions of others people because is only you, the people can't control you life everything. The thing that you already done and you was doing and everything was wrong,what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is not right because doing something that you already done but you didn't get it that's doesn't mean that you life is done or you will never grow that's wrong, when you're sure that what you want you'll be fairing for that thing that you'll lose for many times but you'll be fairing for that and you'll not get tired until you get your dream.

My father is a singer and he's very strong and he really know what he want, one day he participated on one big project about music, he was a really good singer but on the day of the presentation he completely lose his voice, but he won the presentation trying he's best , when he won many people tall him that they wanna to do a big different projects with him ,and now he is a big star and he grow a lot, that;s means that if you try something you'll grow a lot because you have to belief and be very sure what you want and if see if you like, never give up just like me, when I came to United Estates I didn't speak any English and it was difficult to stay here and don't know any English all my homework and my project was difficult, but I didn't give up and i'm steel growing a lot and i have been trying a lot a things and I steel growing. Many people think that if you're so expert and mastered you'll have a really good future , but some people think that the more time you're trying to do the think that you want you'll miss time on your life because the only thing that it's important to you is that think that you really want.

Some people try a lot a things but if they didn't get and they fail and some of they stop what they wanted ,but some of them keep trying and trying their best to get what they want, always try your best and don't give up, when your families or friends tell you that you will not grow more or nothings don't belief that because your're more strong that you know just keep doing and if you're a expert doing that thing you like you'll grow a lot because you have to demonstrate to the people that who you're what you can do. steel faith for that and i'm not agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is wrong just keep wronging and never stop everything depends on you."
196,0ED9E0B4AC30,"I prefer to work alone, because i can focus more and not get distracted by others. Working with a group can be helpful , but some people do more work than others and at the end everyone gets the same credit. This is why i prefer to work alone, so that can get a full credit for the work i did. For example many student's like to work in groups and it takes more time than working alone in my opinion. Students that work in groups can get distracted very easily by side conversations, in the other hand students who work alone can listen to music or go to the library where it's nice and quite. I get a lot of work done working alone than working with groups, because when i'm working alone i get in zone in my mind where i'm like super focused. I be wanting to do more work alone and time passes by quickly, this is why prefer to work alone. this one time i worked with a group because we had to be in group's and i barely did any work to be honest, because there was no competition and i didn't feel motivated at all and i still got the same credit as the people who put in all their hard work into that group work. This is why i prefer to work alone."
965,49D2A80F1484,"In my opinion disagree. Because some people said that is hard, take a lot of time. For example you gotta know how works all the processing, and people do not understand, so some time is very confuse. So in my opinion that first impressions, are very wrong because no everyone wants to be like different.

Secondly is very impossible to change because people do not have time to take care about that stuff. Also because they work they have boobies, shores, take care of their family so is very difficult to be part of that. But also people said that first impression is bad because is impossible to make right.

In addition, some people said that take a while to get used it because you need to be sure, to your goal come true. Also you have to work very hard, and if you do not have enough, time you not are able to get it so that mean, you have to work hard. Example like people said that impressions, are almost impossible to change well, for some reason it should be easy or hard we don't know.

In conclusion, I disagree because impressions, is not easy to take care too, many work in little of period of time so it will take me for ever to do it correct. But also people, said that is very hard and is total true so impressions are very hard to take care.     "
189,0E4FA5AC1EC1,"The power to be successful in life is hard because it isn't always given to you easily you have to work for it to achieve in life. You have to go threw all the good and bad obstacles to grow successfully. If you have high expectations and a positive mindset then good opportunities will be handed to you. You don't need to have money in your life to be successful as long as your a hard worker everything will have a good outcome.

When you go through all the good and bad obstacles you learn along the way that it will take time. It won't be easy and it won't happen overnight. Every baby step you take is getting you closer and closer to your achievement. Having faith in god will help you get through all the obstacles you have been struggling along the way and guide you to the right direction. God put's you through all these obstacles because he wants to test your strengths and weaknesses all you need to do is put your head down and walk right through them. You need failure in order to understand the purpose of life.

Having high expectations and a positive mindset leads you to new chapters in life. When your passionate about something you love doing every negative outcome will come towards you and you have to work ten times harder. There are people who love and support you in every decision you decide to take they just want the best for you. Having them as a support system makes you think to yourself you have a purpose in life and the reason why you continue to do the things you love to do. Your parent's expect you to have high expectations because they wanna be proud of the person you are becoming. You are becoming someone that has great things to achieve in the future all the hard you have worked and put effort into has finally paid off because you worked really hard into getting exactly where you wanted to be that makes you an achiever.

You don't need to be wealthy family in order to be successful. You can come from a poor family and have big dreams and goals and work your way up. All that doesn't define who you are. People can criticize you in every way and make fun of what economy your living in to them as long as your humble and know you are successful without the value of the money in the world you are already successful. Money does not have value in being successful it's all a fantasy people are living in. Money can make a thousands of people happy and handed to them freely but if they haven't worked hard enough for it what value does that money have? In order to be successful in life you need to be humble, an achiever, and a hard worker. All those things make you successful without the value of money.

In conclusion, the value of money, wealthiness, and all the good and obstacles you battle and push through finally paid off you now have the power to be successful in life because even though you fell in every step of the way and sweated through the obstacles you can now be proud of the effort you made and got you to the finish line. All those challenges was to prepare you for the future and help you have a better understanding in life."
118,08FAE6E0BDCC,"Image having to do a activity for school. Your principal is making everyone do an activity and it is not good because some kids need rest and some do not like to do and kind of sport or activity. Also kids need time to relax and do things they want to do.

Kids need rest because they already do lots of work and they need to have energy to do any activity. Also kids like to rest and not do activity's resting make them do activity's so they need to rest. Kids like to hang out with there friends and talk when they do activity's they will not be able to talk to each other and hang out is like resting because they are not going to run and do stuff they like having fun talking to each other. resting is a good thing for kids because they need energy for other stuff.

A lot of kids like to play indoors and not do activity's. kids like to play video games with friends and they have fun. Also there are kids that dont like going outside and like staying in inside they can read play games play with friends because they might have not any interest in anything or not might have many friends to play with in an activity. Kids don't like doing stuff that have to do with activitys they like doing there own thing.

Your princpal makes you do activity for school. kids need rest and some kids just don't like doing activity's. I think making themdo an activity is not good if i was the principal i would let them do what they want to do if they want to stay insidethats ok if they are tired thats ok if they want do club they can.

533,28930E0B8820,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree, The first impressions is the main idea of a relationship. Went you meet a new person you got to show your best impression be respectful, helpful, and have some good attitude.

The first impression is something the you can't change later on the future,because is something the you make or the other person make. On your first impression you need to give your on personality you done want to act different, because then later you going to want to change and you going to make the other person think different about you his going to think you not the person the her knows.

The first thing you show on the first impression is respect. The way you act around the person, things the you do when you with the person, The language the you used around the person.

Also you need to be helpful for the person, show the person the you care about it. Help one each another, and work together. Be happy around the person, your first impression is the one the is going to show your personality.

Also have the person talk about her life. Let her know you wants to know a little more about her, tell her if she need something let you know you always going to be there for her. Make her feel like she won one person not the she have something the is going to rude is life.

All those small things the you make wrongs on the first impression can cost you everything the you ha've been done. Just try to do your best because the first impression is the one the make everything happens.

The attitude is very important in the case , you have to give your best at the first impression.

If you do everything good on your first impression, you going to be fine. Just be happy, respectful, and have a good attitude. All this things can make your first impression wonderful for you and the person you meeting.

But also you need to show your original personality because you don't want to show your opposite.

Everything you do on your first impression is the one the you need to keep with the person, because you don't want the person to leave just because you show something different went she meet you. want to be the same because the first impression is the one the make the relation work.

For those people who think the first impressions don't matter that's a lie because everything you show on the first impression is the one the support your relationship.

If you did everything good one the first impression and now you not doing the same as you stared your relationship is going to be pretty bad. But if you did everything good and you still doing the same everything is going to be fine. Just do your on personality and you don't have to worried about change your first impression.

The way should agree with the first impression is the you can't change what you make at the first impression. Even if you trying to change you always going to remember you ready have goon through the first impression so you always going to have on your relationship.

All the respect, help, and attitude on your first impression is worked you just need to bring all your personality together and your first impression is going to be the fantasy.    "
1310,64A9ECB1C55A,"Have you ever thought about asking other people for advice? Perhaps, people sometimes talk to more than one person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next step, and that person will stop thinking about their choice too much.

FIrstly, the person will be able to know which one is the best choice to go with. I have exprienced it when I make a wrong choice. One time, I planned to clean the car. Than, I asked my parents about it, and they said that You should not clean the car because there is a lot of different diseases that are in the car. I said to myself that my parents are right because I can be sick, tired, and can have different kinds of diseases. Then, I decided that I will not going to clean the car. It is better to ask advise from the people that are your friend or family. Moreover, it will help you to make better choice in your life. One time, I decided to play video games with my friend, and I actually had a test after that day. My friend just ask me that if I have a test. I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and can't think about your question in the test. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. I recommend to ask good people fo an advice.

Secondly, the person will find their next step. I have exprience that when I don't find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. I likly use that trick trick, and I mostly find my step. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. It was an important assighnment so I did'nt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I will say that a person should ask people for an advice.

Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I have expreinced it when I think about my choice so much. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something.

In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best."
3570,F1933BF43F45,"I agree with this idea and I think it's a good idea for me to choose a career at a young age because it's a good way to start to study. If I choose a career at a young age it's good for me because if I don't know about the career then that time teacher can help me and it's easy for me to study when I am in college. At the young age, if I choose the specific career it's good for me in feature and it's important for me.

Yes, it's a good idea for me because if I choose the career at the young age it's easy for me to study when I am taking a career course. It's easy for me to taking a career course because I already learn when I was young. It is important for me if I choose a career at the young age because when I am taking a career when the teacher ask me the question that time I can easily give them the answer. If I do the really good about a career course then one time i'll get success in my life.

It's important for me because if I finish about a career course i'll get a job or i'll do the business. If I do the really good about a career course what I choose one day i'll get success in my life. If I get success in my life i'll be so happy and also my family will be happy.

227,10D5A47D0859,"I disagree whit this statement,because positive attitude is not the solution for all your problems in life there are many problem that you can beat.

when you came to this country and you are alone and dont have help from other people you just cant be positive you dont understand the language and if you are illegal you dont have the many benefit like if you are born here in the united stated you have to hide from the police sometime you can not find a good job because your situation.

2. when you lost someone important in your family and you cant go to se then because you were in other country etc. you can not be positive for this reason i said what i positive attitude is not good of all.

3. if you are from other country some people discriminate you may be they think is easy to be here they dont think about the danger than you have to pass to be here they discriminate you by your skin color and becouse they think you came to this country just to make money and then came back to your country but sometimes you came to suscive and make a knew lefe but many people dont understand that and they trate you so bad and who can have a positive attitude by this reason.

4. yeah! is right there are many thinks to be positive, like your family,frirnds,girfriend have a good jod, graduate from high school is other reason to ve happy and positive but sometime you just can be positive.

some time when you feel bad and you have a bad economic situation youcant caund whit your friendsbecouse they tell you that tney can help you becouse they dont have the resources but some of then are lyan and if you know it you fell like their are playing whit you and that is not a reason to be positive.

so my point is that you can be all the positive you can but sometime bad thinks happens like youare immigrant and you can se your family and that make you be negative."
685,34AC1808D15A,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years.

student who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or in the evening.

Is it a good idea for student to finish high school early?

I believe that is not a good idea for a student to finish high school in three year. The reason for this is because they might have a change of heart in what they want to be. Also having four year of high school gives them time to see if they really made a good choices on their career. Also ""will they go along with take courses during the summer?""

when it time to have fun,relax and enjoy the hot nice weather with family and friends. These are one of the reason that its not good idea.

Another way to look at this is to find out if there going to stick with the career they pick.

For example, when pick a job everyone look for better pay and benefits to see if the best fit for them . For a student it is totally different because they are look for better pay instead of look for a fitting job they will like an enjoy and stay at . Instead they look at a job that didn't suit them, then just quit looking and jumping from job to job.

Therefore i find it best if student take there time and complete all four year of high school so that they see what they like to do and complete all their goals and achievements.

Another subject is that entering college and the work force one year early is stressful with a lot of responsibility.

There no time to be acting out. Taking your time in high school isn't so bad there not as much stress, as in going off to college because of the expenses there will be.

entering college one year early is stressful there many reason. one of these reason is there no time to slack off its all about studying and getting everything done. where in high school you time to turn thing in later if there not fully completed.

As you see there a big different in the two, think about the choices before making a quick one.

In conclusion having four years of high school let them have time to figure out what they want to after they leave to see what they become. There no rush there time, to see what they want to be and what their going to do. There many goals that can be achieve also thing to get better on. Once you leave high school it time to response able for these reason i think it best to do all four year because there no rush on see who you want to be.      "
482,24B8DF4DA85A,"Be active or not active in life, those are two options that we have. There is many reason why people are active in life, but there are many other reasons why people stay inactive on their lifetime. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Staying active and with determination people have more chances to be successful in life.

First of all, in reality things can't be done by them self. For instance, the first TV, car, plane, cell phone, etc... wouldnt be done with out a lot of hard work. Another example could be, the creators of all the things that we have now, they didnt stop or give up on their goals they were active and positive in the process to success.

In addition, in order to accomplish great goals people must stay active and work hard for them.

For example, the best basketball player of all time wouldn't have accomplish all the records with out dedication in the process. Another example, if Martin Luther King didn't do things or stayed back with out doing anything for the people, we probably wouldnt have the life that we all have right now.

Perhaps most important, people have more chances to success in life if they stay active and working on good things, more than if they stay inactive. For example, a hard worker business man probably have way more success in life than a regular person that instead of working hard and do things prefer to stay back and be inactive.

Some people argue that, inactivity serves a purpose. They say that, the fact that people are doing something doesn't mean that what they doing is right. This might be true; however, inactivity wont take people anywhere but to fail in life, and for success in life people must to do things constantly and dont give up.

Without dedication and work people wont accomplish nothing, no matter the talent or the skills that they might have if they dont do nothing with it. People must stay active and fight for what they wish and want, without that life wont take you anywhere."

We depend on technology everyday, we live with it. Technology is changing, evolving even, but are we? I mean, we put our lives in technology though the internet comparing ourselves with one and the other. No wonder so many of us are depressed, they see what other people have but to blind to see what they have is important. Everyone sees the same thing but have a different perspective.

Time wasting is a big one. Peoples eyes are glued to there own personal screen. Sheeple. They care about the new, the best, the bad, and the ugly. They only care about themselves and there phones and shirts with a red bar that says supreme in white text. Competing for the most likes and for the most clout, the fake life they make on the internet is all they care about. Talking the most negative to people through face to facetime never to the other persons face. Scared if they don't fit in or have the latest, the biggest, and the most expensive, the more it cost the better they think. That is all because of technology, wasting time on the screen. The mind and body are effected, a lot of people slouch and have a arched back. A lot of back problems is the most I have been seeing around. I have back problems because of being arched a lot as a kid, it is only in time where everyone has a arched back and the ones with straight backs will be in charge. I say that because you can not stand tall if your back is arched.

Technology has positive effects, it can help to find answers to your homework. You can find love, make a new life, find a new home even. Technology is not that bad it's just people misuse it and abuse it. It helps us but it hurts us at the same time, and people don't see that."
2729,C8DF8FD0D69D,"""Succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm"".

-Former British Minister Winston Churchill

Immigrants who came from differents countries to United States are the most strongest people in the world.

These people really know what failure means and how brave they are to leave their families and find the success that they could not get on their countries.

That's the meaning of this statement and I'll explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase.

I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America.

Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries.

They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes,

sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not.

I'm agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make. When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price.

I hope you have an idea about this statement means , and do not give up on your dreams and the goals that you made some day thinking about make them reallity and if you always want to triumph you have to spend time on it.

1082,52DC3B7C3952,"Working From Home

Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it.

Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they can't because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state aren't taken into consideration.

Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they aren't able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you don't complete you're gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, they'd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldn't have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace.

Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isn't exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students can't spend a lot of time thinking because they don't have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and there's no better place to do that then home, the place you're most comfortable with.

To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place they're more comfortable with."

1808,883C1EF358F6,"At some point in every ones life,There is a time to be self reliant.

People should make there own decisions, Because, As a self reliant person, making a decision based on someone else's advise can be very risky. For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone else's coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan say's ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shot's you take.

Furthermore Making o's own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions. For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies else's job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves.

In conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you."
1785,875151F79017,"Students should not be alowd to graduate with the three year program because the student my have a job, focus on there academics, be involved in a extra curricular activities after scholl. Students may have or need a job for many such ass, being able to sport there family so they are not always going to be available after school to attend those classes required to graduate in 3 years. Students my also need to save up for a higher education if they plane on attending a 4 year university or even attending a community college. students also need some time of work expires so they need that job so they are able to put on there resume that they have some form of work expires so if they decide that right after high school they want to just jump in into the work force they have some type of work expires. Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3 year program is because its going to be stressful trying to put a 4 year education in 3 years. Some students take advance courses that are more chalaging, and give out more homework then regular classes. some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of there grade. A student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extra curricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. another reason is that they might be involved in clubs so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so thats going to take away time so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3 year program. another reason is that they might have tutoring either at home or in school so they are able to get help on homework and other material that they need help with projects and stuff like that.

My conclusion is that no students should not be alowd to graduate early using the 3 year program, became is going to add on to things that the students already have going on in there lives so i believe student should just graduate with there class and take there time and graduate high school in 4 years.

2526,BB87E18DA024,"Student should not find a career at a young age because they haven't choose or think about what career they want to have many student think about what career they want at a young age but, it's better to find what carrer they want when they enter high school because student can talk to a counseling to see what they are intrested in and can see what carrer is similar to what they like.

A lot of student have troubling time to find what career they want to have many student career doesn't end so well, once they enter high school student can find what career to have in the future, student can even visit a website to see what career are intresting for them or can visit careers search in school..

If i have to choose a career at a young age i would not think of anything because i haven't find what career i'm intresting in also, it'll be better i enter high school and find what career i like and enjoy because thinking of what career i want would be hard at a young age also, i can talk to a teacher about career in high school so they can help me of what career are available that are right for me and i don't think student should find a career at a young age it would be hard for them to find one.

I have to disagree of student finding a career at a young age because if student do find a career at a young age then they won't be forcusing in school work they mind will be them having that career by now and will brag about it to there friends and teacher no one want to hear thats also, it may not be the right career for them they need time to think the right career they want to enjoy in life."
3260,E2F31005AF32,"Only topic that is frequenthy is debate today is whether or not conserve energy and resouces since some business have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some peolpe think that not only extending the school day should conserve energy and resource. They feel that is the same thing and also too that is more time in the school in addiction that they will spent more money in energy like electricity, ligths , charge to computers ,blackboard electric and the more things, an resource that should spent more is the water because some students when go to the bathroom they forget closed the washstand. I believe that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because should be take care about of how to conserve energy, resources and the last but not the least is we will have more time for make a the world better and take consience.

One reason i believe why that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours is because we can conserve more energy for the future, and also too the school should instruct to each student to be careful about the how to consume energy, for example to teach wich focus is the correct for the use in the home and gives tips for that maybe they to pay the least possible bill of light.

Another reason is that i feel that a resource that we can save in the school is the water because all students use almost two time the bathroom and always to take down the pull of the toile, i think the students can make posters in where show the importance about how to save the water and others resources that in the school can save is the plastic and paper because in some places purchase this resources, and with the money the school should to be a better school than others and the students should be more careful about this rescources.

The final reason is that i believe if the school add two hours at the day students and teachers should will have more time for to do more thigs, a thing that the teachers and students will can do is maybe a propaganda, in this propaganda they can show the society how prevent the clime global and to instruct how to be careful with of world, other thing that the students can do is a page online in where to instruct the other students and people out school how make herself have to be careful.

As you have read i think that the school should add two hours per day becuase all peolpe in the school can have more conscience for to save the energy and resource the last but not the leas the world. Only when we take consience for change the world. Will we have a better world on day."
688,34E4FB64EEBA,"Don't you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around?

Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? I'm nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, I'm afraid that my family or my friends judge me.

I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. I'm agree with the Idea that he have about the world.

People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example:

You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same.

When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they don't let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful.

Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else.

We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesn't make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want.

There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion don't affect and it shouldn't have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we don't want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality.

We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and that's why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

226,10D3A9E5E79E,"Whlie some people say that doing something that you mastered help you achive your goals, others say that you should try something more challenging to achive more than your goals.

Achiving more than yhour goals can get you farther in life, it can make your job or what you like to do exciting, and your education expands.

If you think you cannot do it, you are not beliving in yourself.

In order to achive your goals and be happy, you have to belive in yourself first.

Put yourself to do more than what you expected.

Being successful meaning get further in life, have to do with the majority of the world, what's around you, and what you put yourself to do.

In my opinion,

getting further in life is great, not so many people have the privilages to do what you can.

A student once challenged herself by taking chemistry.

At first she did not believe that she can do it but hen she ended up passing the class.

Do not expect less from what you deserve.

Some people do not like their job, so they do a really crappy job.

Making your job exciting is great but, how can you make it fun?

First find something that you like.

Then make a challage every week to be successful, keep in mind that is for the better. Think about it like a game.

Everyone likes games meaning that they would like a challege.

Education has been a big part of ours lives and will always be.

A person can learn from just watching a person characteristics.

There is planty ways a person can learn.

Be ready for any occasion that happens, mentally ready, emotional ready, and even physically ready.

Life is full of surprises and will teach us good and bad things through out the times.

Just be your best and learn from every little thing that happen and will happen.

In conclusion Emerson is right, ""do something beyond what you already mastered.""

Meaning that you should challage yourself and achive more than your actual goals.

Believe in yourself and be better each day.

In this world everything is like a game but, is to make you better.     "
502,2623A90F72B9,"Research shows that 75% of individuals agree on Emerson's statement. Well I disagree because you can become better, try is over and over again, and don't bring yourself down.

First and foremost, why I disagree is because you can become better. For example, you mastered a project but you want it better then what you did before look at your project closely. Write on a piece of paper on what you have then plan out your other idea. Don't make it identical make it different. Show people that you can do it but twice as better. So you can be proud of yourself and people can be proud of you too.

Furthermore, why I disagree is because you should try it over and over again. For example, you mastered you project but you challenged yourself to do it twice as better. We all understand to do something better then what you already have can be a little complicated That's why you should try it over and over again so you can accomplish it. That can help a lot to be honest you can see where you made a mistakes and not commit it again.

Last but not least, why I disagree is because you should never bring yourself down. For example, people are getting so frustrated that they will say I can't no more I won't be able to do it. That's bringing yourself down you should remain calm. Don't fell pressured at the end of the day you will do it and you will feel really proud of all of the hard work you did. Dont't ever say never you have to trust yourself if you don't then who will trust you.

This are my three reasons on why I disagree on Emerson's statement because you can become better, try it over and over again, and don't bring yourself down."
3768,FA0A22FE957A,"Summer vacation is for enjoyment. Every student is waiting for it. Students need long break to make his/her mind better. In vacation many students go for a trip with family or with friends. In school days students are waiting for vacation but when they have vacation they miss there school friends. Students need break for 4 to 5 weeks to enjoy there vacation.

Some educators students feel that the summer break is too long and they think when they return to school they cannot catch up easily. They said we have a holiday in year-round means only 1 times in a year. It should be only for 3 to 4 weeks as long as a winter break.

I did not agree with the educators students because students have aslo there life. Ther need to enjoy it make a fun and they also have dreams for their life. Educators students cannot decided others life. If they needs short break then they after 3 to 4 weeks they start study at home and fweel like they are doing their school works. Educators did not like long break because in schoolthey always study and at home also. Long break for educators student is like a death. Educators student cannot enjoy their vacation properly because they alway think about there study. I think in vacations all students cannot think about the study. They need to enjoy their vacation . Educators students also have their life and they need to enjoy it properly had a fun, spend time with with famil or friends. Go gor a long trip and refresh there mind. After all that they can start from begining for their study. They get better ideas for study. They study properly without tension.

I suggest educators students and normal students go togather because educators students also have an idea how to enjoy it make it fun and where they want to go. In summer vacation students may go beach, park, sunshine point and enjoy it. In summer vacation students may enjoy ever single movement because it can be there memories.

After then they finish there schools they can missed tht evey single movement that they had a lot of fun on it. They miss theirfiends whom they enjoy. They miss there school. But after their schools they cannot meetv their friends easily because all friends may go somewhere else for their study and for their best future.

So coclusion is every student enjoy the break. Do lot of fun with friends.

1087,5335796068E8,"Students should commit to a career in high school, because they would get a better understanding about the career they want to do by the they are out of high school.

Students would know what to do after high school. The student wouldn't worry about what job their going to get or what collage they want to go to. They would have everything figured out and it would put less stress on them. For example, If you already know what you want to do it would be easier to apply for collage and you could get a part time job in the career that you chose.

Students would know a lot about the career they want to do. In high school they could research things about their career like how much they pay,the conditions they work in, and if it takes a lot of work. They could also talk to people that are in that career and take academy classes. It would make it easier for the student because they would be well educated about the career. For example, when they apply for collage or a job they could say that they've been studying and have a better understanding of that specific career. It would give them a better chance in getting accepted or getting the job.

It would be easier for the student to get a job in the career. The student would have a better chance of getting a job in the career they want to do if they have been learning and taking classes in high school. They would be prepared and wouldn't be scared of not knowing what to do when they get the job. If the career they want to do requires them to go to collage it would be easy for them to pass the classes because they would know mostly everything. For example, when they apply for the job they could see that they finished collage which would give them a high chance of getting the job.

In conclusion Students should have a career in mind when they are in high school. It would make it easier for them and their future.      "
2399,B261F438E0DA,"I think that honesty is so important because, being honest can make you gain trust from others. Honesty makes life easierit helps by telling the truth everyone can get along. What ever the situation is good or bad you still have to tell the truth because it is good for everyone and, yourselves. When your honest more people can trust you and, the more people that trust you the better of a person you are. However, when it comes to suicidal thoughts or someone isnt feeling good tell the truth to an adult even though your friend told you not to you did a great thing for your friend, you might have saved his life. You can always tell the truth because being honest is always helpful and, good because, you did a good thing. Being honest is needed everywhere because if everyone was a liar our country woudn't be good. Telling lies is not good for you it's a bad habbit for you and, once you lie a couple times you will countinue to lie over and, over. Whatever it's about lying is never the answer to solve problems it makes it worse. You loose trust, you don't get anything out of it, and you just seem like a bad person by lying. For example, say you stole something and it was your friends toy. You decided to take him when he left it there and, he asks you ""Have you seen my toy"", The best option is to give it back or tell him that you have it don't lie and take it. It doesn't matter how badly you want it it's not yours. The boy's mother bought him that and it wouldn't be nice to just take it from him. The boy would feels sad and, the mother would not like that too and, you wouldn't feel good after because lying hurts. Telling the truth is always the right choice to do in any occasion."

2574,BF56324B3A86,"Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they don't are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that don't live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you.

Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really don't matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things don't define you like a person and this aspects don't give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you don't have happiness you don't have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they don't want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people don't can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they don't be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are don't be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward.

Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they.

First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself.

Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their life's or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they don't are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy.

Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself.

Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person don't have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that don't have that be equal and that it's fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, don't care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down.

Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that don't accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and don't allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal.

Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive.

Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.

3519,EFBD506FC8F2,"Select me to visit your company It would be a great opportunity to learn more about this job, but also is going to help me to have better skills in what I do. I could easily write about my six years of experience in this area, and you would see that I could ""qualify"" for this visit, but I don't want you to select for those reasons; working in a TV Production company has always been my dream since I was a kid.

I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasn't like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, I'm not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didn't know If coming to America would change my dream,

everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I don't have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

These are just some of the reasons why you should select me to visit and learn more about your company, I know you may have more applications of students with better grades and experience than me, but no all of them have the passion and enthusiast that I have, because this wouldn't be just a job, I would be a the biggest accomplishment for me."
1756,85004BC426B1,"Would you like to seek multiple opinion from different people? I think is good for you to seek opinion from people . Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you make new friends,

have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion.

Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example,

if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone.

Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life.

Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you . Helping your friend for example, helping him or her with his homework or something he or she needs help with , advising him or her to do the right if he or her did something wrong, being nice and respectful to everyone can also make someone have a good relationship with you.

Seeking multiple opinion allow you to make new friends. Sometime when you are making new friends you dont just have to make friends, you have to think about it .

Make a friend who respect everyone, correct you when you do something wrong and someone who is there for you because, when something happen to and you have a bad friend, he or she will not help you but, If you have a good friend, he or she will help you when you are in a bad situation. Good friends are all way there for you when you have a problem with something or someone.

Well that is what I think about seeking multiple opinion. I hope you know some benefit of seeking multiple opinion . Whould you like to seek multiple opinion from different people ? I also hope you learn smoething from what I think about seeking multiple opinion.

1929,9145AB74E1DA,"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them."
3418,EAB3924FD98F,"Students should take four years of high school, instead of three years, because students can have more time to learn, students can have electives, students can enjoy their summer vacations and their evenings, and finally students have more time to do stuff.

Althought some schools think that is better to offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, actually students should take four years of high school. First students can have more time to learn. For example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they don't have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a 5pm and end at 7pm, so at that time students are tired and the don't have much energy, so it's difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff. Second students can have electives, students can have classes like gym, art, and music students can discover new talents in that classes, also students relax their minds in that classes and enjoy the school. Third students can enjoy their summer vacations, students get tired for study ten months, is good that they can relax and pass time with their family and friends, so their mind is clear, and when they start study they have good attitude, energy and they want to learn new stuff. Finally students can have more time to do stuffs, because they can go home and do their homeworks, study for exams, pass time with their family, and have good sleep hours, they don't have to worry about go to school in evenings, they can relax.

Students should take four years of high school, so they have more time to learn, they can have electives and learn new things, they don't have to study on the summer and they can enjoy their vacation and evenings with family and friends, and finally they can have more time to do sttufs. "
3738,F8FD4F6B6DE6,"Dear, Generic_Name

The issue on this prompt is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. Even if you do not feel well, we need to show a good attitude to people. A positive attitude is always important in our life.

Show a positive attitude when you are in school or work is really important, to any place that we go always be respectful with people. I agree with this statement as a result that if we want to achieve our goals, first thing that we need to do is always be with a good attitude to everything. The importance of attitude is that people will treat you, like the way you speak to them.

What people like teacher, students, and doctors achieve is as a result that they were success in life to achieve what they are now. These person always were with a positive attitude to achieve what they want to do. Sometimes depend on how our personality looks like, people evaluate ourselves.

Like I said to triumph in life, we need to obey life lesson. Sometimes we learn the importance of attitude from another person. Positive attitude teach us to appreciate life, as a result that some people can not have education. some people that do not have attitude they never go to school, as a result that they don't think positive. A good education is like a positive attitude, we can achieve great things.

I think we should not allow the student to bring there cell phone to school because they only use it to play or text that why peoples grade are low and 10% of people are failing. I know a lot of kids in my class that are failing. Kids in my class surely text a lot to the other kid in school. That why I think that we should not allow cell phones"
3429,EB403A2AA1DB,"I would share that life is not easy. Enjoy your life as much as you can. enjoy your childhood. Because when you grow up you won't be able to go back

In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Enjoy it bore it ends.

Everyone goes through something in their life. Everything will get better. Just don't think negative. Always look up never down. Cause if you do look down you won't see your bright future that will come.

Do good things in your life. Like be nice to people don't be rude, disrespectful, and mean. That's not going to help you in life. what's the point of being mean. Don't take your anger out on others. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Taking your anger out on someone who didn't do anything is not going to help. Its's making the problem worse. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson.

Don't rush things in your life. Give things time, be patient. You don't know what can happen if you rush things in life. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. thats how life is. Life teaches us a lesson. We need to believe, have hope in life. if we dont how can we know things will get better.

We need to have hope to learn the lesson.

The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind.

For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. But that didn't help. Things got harder for me. I didn't have hope. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying. How is this going to help me in life. I opened my eyes and began to try. I started to believe. It helped me a lot. life is never easy. life is full of lessons that will teach us something. "
3796,FAC8305E209D,"When I was working at the Daycare, it was not only me working and taking care of the kids, there was three more ladies doing the same job and working all together. So I think that is more benefit working in group that working alone because it make easily the things.

First, the first thing we do is give the kids breakfast, and while the kids are eating two of the ladies are looking after them, and the others two, are planning the activity that the kids are going to be doing during the day and try to keep them busy. Also all ladies give ideas and at the end we try to put all ideas together and work on it as a team.

While the day is passing, we do everything we need to teach and do the activities, and working all together is easily for us to finish early. when we finish early we always read or dance until the time to go home comes. Also we disgust who was the one that behave was good and we also give stars for the behavior to kids. Sometimes the kid don't behave well and if there were only one person taking care of the kids it most be difficult to do what we all four need to do.

Also, everyone goal is to keep the kids safe,having fun, and also learning who to write, so at the time for them go to school they are going to feel relative and don't be scare of going to a regular school. And when that happen is how we know that we make a work together.

As you see, I feel that is more beneficial working together in a group because, everyone in the group has ideas, is easily to finnish everything fast and also everyone has the same goal."
276,14409A305AB3,"As a student, I can say there are a lot benefits for a student from being able to attend classes from home, is really convenience for a student that some schools offer distance learning as an option, every school should have that opportunity; it ca be helpful for a lot of students, is good for students that does not have a lot of time, so that help them to have a flexible manage of time, in some cases the student are more successful by taking the classes online.

For example if some students have to work , and because their work's schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities.

Also when someone have to travel a lot for some reason, taking the classes online they do not have stay in the same place every time they are taking the classes, it dose not matter, they can take it anywhere they want, the only two things they need is a computer, and also to have internet connection, and thats it, they should be good with those two things or some people do not have that facility of moving of one place to other, they do not have the money to defray cost for the transportation, or is just to far away from their houses, so the classes online are a way to fix that problem.

There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study,

when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done.

So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule."
3761,F9DDE725DB74,"To begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma.

First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the

Hampton University. Furthermore, students who's want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort.

Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you don't have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they don't have any type of help from their families.

If students have to work is because they want to enter college.

Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he don't have time to his asignments of high school. Some students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they don't have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school.

In conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. So it's good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students can't graduate not because they don't want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes. Also, when students have a positive main they can achieve whethever they want, it doesn't matter the situation that you live you can finish your high school and enter college if you work hard. "
2313,AC692F322516,"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given.

Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them.

Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class.

Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students.

Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do. Provided the knowledge that is given to students and stay on task when is need that way, it helps you not to get lost, but it also can provide students to learn and not to use their phones. More students lose track on time and whats around them. Using cellular devices can stop you from not doing the job quicker. It can slow the work and lesson that is given to them.           "
304,163AC455E1DF,"In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student because, you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being home schooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing. "
2724,C868C220A380,"I disagree,and here on my reasons. If you just believe on your imagination then knowledge it wouldnt end up go for you. 1,people would think your crazy. 2,people would not even believe it would even work or would ever come true. Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that.

I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then you'll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and you'll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that you'll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination. If yo keeping thinking about your own little world your own little world you live in,then you would just forget on how the real world is a scary place.

Second of all,If you have a big imagination,people would not even believe that it would ever come true. Reson number 1,people would just believe in whatever you do. Think about it,their are so many ideas that just shut down,like how bills get made but they dont even get to the second step of becoming a law. Reason number 2,Everyone judges on what you think and what you believe. Some might agree,but most of all they just think your werid or crazy. So yes, it's scary to think on what people believe in what you imagine.

Finally,People would just think your plain on dumb. If your imagination gets to out od hand,people would just think your dumb or disagree with you. Yes,it's werid or even sad to have people judge or think your done with your own fantasy. People won't take you seriosly. And if they don't take you like you mean business,then they just won't talk to you at all. And your left with nothing but your own ideas. So,its risky to have a really big imagination because people would just think your plain on dumb or they might take your ideas and leave you with nothing.

In conculsion,I don't think it would be a great idea to have a big imagination. Knowledge is best because people won't judge you,they wont think your crazy,and they would believe you a 100%. I think its great having a big imagination,but dont get to attach to your imagination."

1292,62F7911DE51F,"Once author Ralph Waldo Emerson Said ""unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have masterd you will never grow"", and he is right. To truly understand what thee author is trying to is saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failer. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery.

If you can ride a bike than learn how to ride a mottercicel, if you are able to make a cupcake than learn how to bake a cake, if you know how to float then learnand teach your self how to swim. Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Untill you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just becuase you can't do one small task doesn't mean that you can not master it you havr to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow. Now it's up to you to decide weather or not you want to grow as a person or not weather to grow or stay the same and never to achive your goals in life."

by eating in a healthy way students will have healthy life, will be able to play any sports that they want, they're going to be ready for school, will have their mind opend, they will be succed in class and school, life, this could make students to be out of any pain or sickness the planning of changing food cafeteria could be a problem in students way to eat, students would make a radical change in their body, i think the administatrion or county need to make a survey whether or not do this change, they need to understand that some shool have differentes religion,races, they need to consider that as aone of the cons becuase they can't make studentsneat food that they're not allow to eat, if that's the case students won't eat and that might a problem becuase those students might get sick, if they're planning to do a change, it has to be the one with offering food from around the world so can everyone be able to eat."
2932,D325C8F858F6,"A group of students have skill to take decisions, there're a lot way to do, students can react to any problem, but work alone can be good as a group, people who like work alone have abilities: reasoning, recognize, and expression. Groups were created to share ideas. Therefore, it's not bad get help from other people, everyone say, "" two head think better than one.""

Groups make different way to share or send a message, a few people can create a lot, base in their share of thoughts, abilities, and decisions. Groups have the most of attention in this case. Elsewhere, work alone is base in just you, and what you know, if something that you did it, come to be wrong, you will not share it. If people who like work by their self can't support ideas with reasoning, can't do a perfect project. the change of ideas always will be a good work and the can support your reasons, why you had make it.

Work in group include: less work, time, and money, back to work alone you have your own words, spend a lot of your time more than you think, also could take too much time to finish. To different of groups students can do other activities. The group help to students to learn and combine new thought from other students. Friends can help to get a correct answer or do a good work.

The important of groups is that students learn to share, help, and be kind with other students make a friend, besides that learn, help, and teach to other, they make fun their work. work alone give stress and that show someone who want to make everything by his\herself they share their own ideas. Sometimes work alone can be a good choice, because is you're wrong, you can't blame to nobody.

In conclusion, I believe that groups are more helpful for students, because they learn to take other decision and compare. About work alone, I'm not agree, because you try to do something, maybe that's good, but you're not count with other ideas, expressions, or declaration of other thought. In my opinion is more beneficial working in groups that show us compare, analyze, and be friendly with others."
3055,D9F549A8EE63,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson we must never be determined to be idle. Becuase life is too short you got to follow your dreams don't be idle. Everday you do more you learn more, you acomplish more as long as you believe, and have the heart for it .I don't like braging about my self but I am allways doing something. Right now i am 18 and belive it or not i own two busniss. I make good money but it everday is a struggle to keep the busniss runnig good and going to school but i never once thought about stoping here i wana do more i wana be sombody .

Frist, reason why i agree with Thomas jefferson is becuase if your idle you will never make it out i promise here is a example Donald Trump he is one of the richest people in America and he has his own air plane decraded with 24k gold so you know he has accomplished a lot of things he can be retired living in a island right now but right now instead he is the president of united states you know why becuase he is not a idle person he wants to do more like what Ragin(rip to thats mans) said ""dont ask what your country could do for you ask what you can do for your country"" and that is what Donald is doing right now he is doing more and acomplishing more .

also, its okay to be idle some times we humans everydody needs a little break just as long as you believe. And make goals for your self you will be alright. The most important thing is that you do it the right way their are no short cuts in life and that is why i agree with Thomas Jefferson ""determine never to be idle."""
3158,DE841BF24A2F,"A wise man always said "" Thinking out of the box can get you a better choice."" Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice for several reasons.

First, they will have more choices to choose due to this problem. Everybody will have a different idea because of their way to look at the problem, they might think the problem out of the box and give out some choice that you never think of. Recently, my friend Generic_Name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that Generic_Name like better. It is important to think the problem in a different way because after that you can find a better way to solve it .

Second, seeking for multiple opinions can help you collect ideas and solve the problem with friends and family. It is important to think together with friends and family because it can help you with more ideas and power. Recently, my friend Generic_Name got bully in school two moths ago, Generic_Name cry in the restroom alone because the person that bully him told that

Generic_Name cannot tell anybody about what happen, after he get home he told his parents and principal start to find out the person bully Generic_Name. After that, Generic_Name know it is very important to let parents know that his feeling.

Third, seeking for multiple opinions can let people feel like they are not alone to this problem, most of the time people can cause the mind to do wrong things because they feel like no one want to help them and leave them alone. Recently, Generic_School did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them. If everyone can also help each other when they have a problem, maybe we can make the world much better.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can make people make a better choice and it can also benefit other and make the world much better ."
485,24DAF94F0A18,"I am sure my heart is raising that I saw a lot of people behavior is going bazaar! Then it is said that your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because it creates trust, shows that your helping others, and creates a positive big impact on others.

Your own behavior creates trust is to show that other can respect you and care about you. Friends behavior creates trust because they will sometimes help others. For example, if i have a huge injury and I can't walk, then probably they'll know that I'm not joking around and I'll trust them to help me. Another person behavior that creates trust is teachers, their behavior is mostly positive and always influence others. They'll always care about helping their student and makes the student trust the teacher what they need help on. Even though students think that teacher dont trust them, but others think teachers have faith on others to try hard to help and let them work hard for the future. Also, families creates trust so they will always have influence on me. It like i made their personality more positive than before. Your own behavior creates trust because of helping others, having positive personality, and increase better relationship on others.

Showing that you help others is another way to influence other people from your own behavior. Sometimes my families help others and they will never forget about us. Like all of our family went to Generic_City and went on a mission to help others, like we build houses or feed a lot of poor people with food that we made. Another person that help others is friends, they always help me if i'm in a stress zone. They always comfort me feel better when I'm upset or mad. Also, teachers help other because they want the students to past the school. Although some of them might fail, yet teachers try their best to let them past. They want them to try hard so teachers need to make them work hard and help them learn. Like my teachers will try their best to help me past my quizzes or test. Helping others is the best way to influence people like friends, teachers, and families that they will support you and others what they need.

The reason why your own behavior creates a big positive impact of others. So more and more people will show respect and will mostly love you. This will create a big positive impact on friends because I show love for them and they will probably love me back. All of us should always show love and care so that they wont hate you. For families, they always have a positive impact because of others positive attitude. Showing a good attitude can be like walking the bridge to their heart. This can help their feeling be better and better. Another person that have a big impact on others is firefighters. They always care about others and their lives so they always protect them when they're in trouble. There was one story that these firefighters that they need equipment because their tools is rusty and broken, but one person called them for help so they came the house was on fire and the wife is still trapped. So they got her out and she is save. So the husband so so proud, and send them 2,000 dollars a month so the firefighter can bye the equipment. This it to show how much the husband care about them. So this can create a big positive impact because of showing love, fixing feelings, and having risk to protect.

Other might say that your own behavior can affect others. It has said that you own be behavior can influence other by showing that you help others create a positive big impact, and creates trust. We should see if others behavior can influence others and change the world.       "

2843,CEC6870D564F,"Hi, These is Generic_Name. In my opinion is a good idea the school allowing students to have and use cell phones in classrooms.

First, at all student can use cell phone for any emergency or use the Google translation because sometimes is take minutes to find out in the dictionary. Also, because in some schools Student can't have access to use computer.

Second, Sometimes teachers put some worksheet or order tints to do in Google classroom and we have to do by using a computer and sometimes computer gate very slow and we can do by use cell phone device is sly.

Third. We know some student use cell phone for bad propose like to no't pay attention in class or make bulling other classmate. But, I think if the Schools use different methods like to block some app for example Snapshot or other student use to bulling.

finally, It's convenient to use cell phone in class special wen the teacher is to busy and we can use the cell phone to gate information about math or any other class.

In conclusion,

base in that is necessary to use a cell phone for any emergency. We can finding word that we don't known by using Google translation. It is good to use cell phone for education purposes.                         "
1118,56C4259AA5C2,"Is always good to try new ideas, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Nobody can tell you if you can do something or if you can't, the unique that can stop you is yourself. Learning new thinks help us to recreate our minds, help us to make new projects in life or work, help us to create new ideas and most of the time we can have fun. Also try to do something more besides you career will help you to have more options of work and more possibility to have a better economic situation.

In fact, it will help you to be responsible in all the staff that you do daily, in your home, in your job, in the school, with you friends, etc. It will prepare you for what is coming in the future and it will help you get mature mentally.

However, take two or more careers at the same time can harm you, and make harder you progress in your main career. For example: I got a friend his name is Generic_Name, he's taking film producer career, he needs to take those classes for almost three more years. In addittion, he started to do photography career like two months ago. He really like both careers, and Generic_Name think that if he take both careers at the same time it would be easy in the future for get a better work and make more money. But he realize that it will be really hard to do both careers at the same time, he began to feel the stress and the pressure that he will no do it really good on both careers. He realize that it was really complicated and that he was losting his time and his money on something that it wouldn't end really good.

Then my recommendation was to finish first film producer career because it was the career that he really wants to finish first, it was his dream to be a film producer and make some movies, we always talked about this. So I said first you need to finish film producer career and after that, it will be better to take photography career like second choice. Anyways, Generic_Name was really frustrated because he thought that he will do it really well, but his mistake was that he didn't organize his time and his life; that's what happen with most of the people that think that do more than one career is impossible, and is not that, is just that you need to organize yourself and your time. After that Generic_Name understood that do easch career at the time it would be better and he decided to start with film producer first and add Photography career after two more years.

In Conclusion, take two different careers or masters are not a problem, you just need to organize your life and check what is the priority for you, it doesn't matter how long you take, in a future you will see all the benefits that you are going to have, how you grow up and how you can be an example for other people that think ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have alredy mastered, you will never grow up"", if you try to do something beyond what yopu have already mastered it probably being easier, but that doesn't mean that if you do another career you will not be a successful person. Finally you just need to demostrate that you effort and you sacrifice is going to be for something better in your life."
2277,AA32237D75CE,"Many people think that older students can be helpful to the younger students on the other hand many people think that the older student can not be helpful to the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders.

The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

Finally to shows the younger s how to do something, older student can be helpful when you need help they can help you. to ilistued. when i came to America i was in third grade i was new and i didn'et know what are the school rules and i didn'et know any thing about school and also i did'net know how to speak English. So there was students how was older then me and the help me where was my classroom because i was getting losed in school and every time when i was getting in to boy bathroom there were showed me where was girl bathroom and they were helped me how to speak English.

The older students are available to assist the younger students by the older students give a advise to the younger, to help them make more understandable on the subject, and to show the the younger how to do something. "
2342,AE0DB193F5B5,"Today, in the actuality, a lot of people have a big dreams that we can to complete have a better life for our future family or also to own self but a many people be surrender becuase most of the time have the fuilures, when they are doing something; I think that our life without the fuilures will be bored and easy becuase we don't have the energies to work hard or fight for our goals or dreams. I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you can help other to complete their dreams or their goals, also you can have more spirit and a positives attitudes than you have in the begging, also you can be a successful and strong person.

You can help others to complete with their dreams or their goals, because sometimes a lot of people who want to comply their dreams or goals they don't have the motivation of their families or the economy necessary to buy all the studies or all the things that they need, so when you finish all the goals that you make you, you can assist to others. I know an experience of child from Mexico, his name was Generic_Name. Generic_Name was a child with the low economy resources, I remember that he toll us all the things that he was comply to get a better life for his family and him self. So one day, Generic_Name received a big notice from a presidency of Generic_City, the place were we live, that he can have a opportunity to study whatever he want. He and his family were happy for the big opportunity that Generic_Name have. At pass of the years, when Generic_Name finished study the collage, I know that Generic_Name is a big entrepreneur from a big company that he created after finished the college. Today, also Generic_Name likes help other people who want to be a successful in their life like the presidency help him. In my observation to be a good person likes Generic_Name makes that you have a lot of open opportunities to get the success or the things that Generic_Name every day was dreamed.

Also you can be a successful and strong person because all people knows that the life is not easy and less if you want to do something hard or something that you need put a lot of time in it to pursuit of success and if you think that your goals or dreams are difficult to complete. Sometimes we need strive more that the people or your mind think. Another of my experiences is when was in Mexico, I was little girl, I remember that most of my days I talked with my family, my mother, my father and also sometimes with my grandfathers; about that I want study the High School in Untied States because I saw a TV Shows and movies shows all the schools and also my father lived a lot of years in this country so, he talk me about the schools, the teachers, the classmates, the classes and classrooms that were to different form my country, the lunch time and I think that the thing that was more exercise was with the lockers because in my country don't have lockers or something to put our things likes books, pencils, notebooks and sometimes, the food. At the time that was grow up, I was continue with the same mentality to come to this country to comply my studies. I remember that have a lot of failures in the time to the arrival to United States but,even if never let that my thoughts or the commentaries of the negative people will be fell bad about my big dream. I think that was a strong person because is hard to come to other place with different culture and customers in everything and also is hard and sad separate to the persons who love.

Other might say that the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success does not matter or they are disagree because you can lose your forces to continue and accomplish your goals and sometimes this failure can make us fell sad. However, you can have more spirit and positives attitudes than you have in the begging because when you have a failure in something that you study a lot or put your all time in it, you can have the mentality that you can to do well it, just you need strive a little be more that you make before. This is one of my experiences in my life; the last week, in my History class with Generic_Name, we have a quiz form the first unit so, we did the quiz, but the majority of my classmates and me, we don't pass the quiz, my teacher talked with us to give us a another opportunity to pass it. A lot of my classmates tell her that they do not were think that they can pass it even though they study a lot before the retake but, I have the spirit and the positives attitudes that I can passed the quiz with a good grade and study well at home. I think that my experience, it is good example because a lot of people who want to complete their dreams does not matter the times that they need to try to get a good result and a good recompense for the effort that they make.

In my opinion, I think that Churchill's statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" it is important and I agree with it because you can motive other people to be a good person with good feelings and goals, another reason is because you can to be a successful and respectful person and you can have a good attitudes through haved a bad results, every time you need stay be happy. Most of the people we have the big goals to comply something that always we dreaming."
1364,6907AC535720,"""Stop doing that, your cousin cut his hand because he was doing the same thing"". A lot of times people say an example to make you know what would happen if you continue doing it. But, is the example the best way to influence people? Yes, an example will make you know that you are doing something bad, it will let you know what are the consequences of it, and you know that the example influence others, because you can see that your parents are the most important example in your life; they are going to make you as a person.

When you are doing something bad and the people see it, they will probably tell you an example of something that you are doing something bad or innapropiate; for example, when you are climbing a tree, your mom would tell you stop doing that, your sister broke her arm because she was climbing that tree, that is going to make you think if you are doing something good or bad. It is going to make you know that people are telling this to you, because they don't want you to have bad consequences. Another example would be that when you are drinking, somebody would tell you don't think to drive, because my uncle died because he was drunk and he had a car accident,so you will know that people are advising you, because they know that you are doing something bad. When people tell you a good example to stop doing something, it will make you know that you are doing something bad.

A lot of times you are doing something, and you don't know the consequences of your action, maybe, it can break your arm, or it can send you to the hospital; but when people tell you an example it will let you know the actions; for example, if you are listening to music very loud, you couldn't know that it can make your ears very bad, but when people tell you turn the music down, my sister's ears are very bad because she was listening to music very loud; after that you know that you better stop doing that, because it will bring you very bad consequences, and you do not want that, so you would stop. Another thing, is that knowing the consequences of your actions, could help another people; for example, if you are drinking you should know that you can not drive, if you do not drive another person will not die, because you know that you can have a car accident, and that is because people told you an example of what is going to happen if you drive while you are drunk. An example can help you to know the consequences of your actions.

A lot of people say that you are who you are because of your parents, and that is right, your parents are the most important example for you. They are going to tell you what is good and what is wrong; your parents influence you because they are your most important example, and that is what an example does, influence you, tells you what is good and what is wrong; for example, if your parents are good people, you should be a good person, but if your parents do not care about you, they do not listen to you or they treat people bad, you are going to be somebody who doesn;t listen to people, you will not care about anyone, so your parents are your most important example, because they have taught you what is good and what is wrong; and you can see again that the example influences you. The parents are your most important example and influence.

We saw that an example can make us think what is good and what is wrong, it is going to tell us the consequences of our actions, it will make you think that you are doing something bad, and we can see that the example influences you because we have our parents, we are going to be the same as them, because they are the people that is going to teach us how to act. So yea, the example is the best way to influence people."

840,408A7D3D2EEC,"Imagine seeking advice from multiple people and choosing the best decision that suits you. How does that make you feel? Asking for advice can be defined as someone who asks help from multiple people and makes the right decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because they can see which advice is better, more experienced, and see the persons point of view.

Asking advice from multiple people can help you see which advice is better. Let's say this person needs to ask their teacher what book to choose. But, they also asked their friends the same question. They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome.

Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, that's because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life!

Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Let's say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice.

In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective. This affects you because its on you to ask for advice and make the right decision!"

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they don't focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face.

To begin with, sometimes students don't learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer.

In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do.

For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind.

To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home.

At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away.

In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass.

Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily.

Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.  "
1120,56E32CEEB127,"We should accomplish always when doing something to determine do to wonderful things. if we do more things we will accomplish the goals we have in our heads to go on forward. Thomas Jefferson he accomplish many in his life having to make write the declaration of independent he did not waste time to relax around and chill his buddies. When we start doing something with our life we set goals every year what do you do?, the every next we try to accomplish our goals because when we are trying check our goals we are always doing something it never stops and it will never stop because thats we are non stop workers . many people can waste there time and not finishing there goals . Each person has something in there hearts to not stop and there motive to keep going on forward and trying to do something there life .over the years you see news things examples new phones and new shoes and TV but whos behind the idea a person and what did they do worked hard to make improvement. we are always doing something thats how the world is right now to accomplish new things every year generation to generation always improving .When we do things we do it for a purpose because its wonderful how much we can never stop giving up we always have to be doing something because if people see you not doing something its a waste of time for you and the person .This is how are world is runs by doing something in your life by going to school learning then going collage and finding a career for yourself and all this is by doing something your life to accomplish your goals and to improve your life to grow more and more gain knowledge and not stop what you want to do. We do accomplish when always doing something. in your life there always people pushing you forward and sometimes you feel like not doing nothing do but do something because if you do it you a accomplish a goal that your parents give you .

Your parents why dont you leave the videos games and start doing something in the house and start washing the dishwashers and getting a job to make money and this is when you have to start doing looking accomplishing your goals not in the house wasting your time and not do nothing. do we accomplish more if we are always doing something and the answer is yes and dont stop doing something cause everyday your accomplishing it without knowing it."

Summer projects can be fun, if only they were chosen by students. If the students were to pick their own projects depending on the subject; they would be interested, more likely to do it, and enjoy as well.

teachers spent a whole summer or a school year coming up with a topic for the students to do during the summer. And, it turns out that the students aren't giving it much though or effort towards their given assignment. That can be waste of the teachers time and energy, but if the students were to come up with a topic and idea of their own they would do the project.

if students were to choose their project, they would more likely to do it because its on something they want to learn and their curious. when students are curious they tend to explore their curiosity and be more drawn in the subject and want learn more about it. students can come up with great ideas when comes to doing their own projects. choosing a topic of your interest in a projects can explore students mind, and do the things they would never though of doing.

The summer project can improve your grades in the class. for example a student that struggles a lot in class either because the they cannot keep with pace in class, with summer projects they can work on their own pace. and if students are not great at working in environment full students this gives the a chance to do in depended study. summer project can give an opportunity for students to increase their greats. if students were to chose their own assignment they could at pace that worked for them, and they wouldn't have to worried about due time date. students would have the whole summer to finish the project, and if they did not finish it, when they an entire summer to do it, now that's just being lazy and it can effect their grade.

Subject can have a great impact on the student. If student is given an assignment on a certain subject their is a chance they would start procrastinate or not do it at all.

therefore they would have zero interesting on doing the summer assignment. for example if i had a history project and a science project. And if my science teacher were to give me a project to do a research paper on how gene mutate, as interesting that sounds i would not do it because science does not fascinate me as history.

Being able to choose a project of your own can be fun that way, it gives a student to look forward to do their work and be more fascinated it. Students should design their summer project; because that's less work on the teacher,

it gives them an opportunity to just think outside their box, and they can make their teachers proud for doing their work, so they can look forward a better school year.    "

The school is necessarily and beast place in world. is that savety.

2049,9A93D940C694,"Is it true that some students at some point in their life want vacation time? Yes, because not everyone is a retard that wants to be studying and going to school all the time. Almost every student wants rest from homework. I think having a summer break for students is a good idea because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives them time to spend some time with their family and enjoy thier every minute of life.

First of all, I think it's a good idea to have summer break because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives students some free time to do what they want to do like trying new things out, playing new sports and finding what their real talents are, instead of doing school work and other activites all the time. Doing meditation is really good for your brain and mind, and it's only done when you have time for it and nothing to distract you.

Secondly, I think it's a good idea to have summer break for students because it gives them time to spend some time with their family. Some of us are really bad at giving our parents time in life because it's just too much to do everyday. Half of student's day they spend in school and get no extra time for their parents. Spending time with parents is not wasting time when your really enoying it and it's a good time spend.

On the other hand, some people might argue that it's not a good idea for students to have summer break because they will waste their time by being home all day or texting their friends. It will kill their education time and won't give them enought time to get to where they want to be in future.

In conclution, I think it's a good idea for students to have summer break because it gives them the opportunity to go new places they never been to and try out new dishes they never tasted. I think life is too short to be doing homework and studying for tests, and planning for your future. Life is about having some fun time and enjoying every little moment with your family and friends instead of focused on one thing all day and everyday which is school.    "
2756,CA58CF3D8943,"people are scare to make their own decisions , some of them when they have a conflict or a problems in their life, most probable ask an experts like psicologo to help or to they can give them a advice. I agree that each people with self-reliance follow they own instinct and ideas that matters if the make at mistake, and do not care what the other people can say about you.

People need to take they own decisions. Many people are scare to make their own decision and went this happened they decide to ask somebody else like a psicologo to help in their own problems, in my opinion this it is wrong because it is your life, you need to care no somebody else. In my case sometime i have a problems when i want to take a decision in my life, but in my opinion this is good because i care about my self and always i want to do everything good . Young people are scare to make they own decision and this is understanding, some of the people they do not follow their instincts and ideas, this means that sometime they take somebody else ideas.

people always have a conflict to believe in their self.

Many people do not believe and also do not trust they instincts and ideas, this happened went that person always take a decision but that decision it is a mistake. or sometime they care what the other people say about them, for this reasons i think they have a conflict and they are scare.

people with a self-reliance. People with reliance believe in they self, they take a decision with out any problems and also they do not ask for helps. This people when they decide to take action or give a ideas they do not scare what the people can say about they decisions. Many people have problems when they have to take any decision in theirs life, almost all the time is because they care what they people can say about them.

In conclusion, people do not need to care about what the they people say or think about their life,

it is your life you decide how you want to enjoy it. That matters if is with mistake, Some people are scare to make their own decisions, some of them ask for help or any advice. each persons need to trust in self and instincts."
1311,64AE19BBA321,"A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because of many reasons, first reason why I agree is it never will solve the problem if you don't try to at least do it, second reason is that you feel more competitive to face the problem, the last reason is that your friends and family can help you a lot with the problem.

If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you don't do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you everyday, and if you dont do anything about that then its gonna get worse and worse everyday.

When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem so it can never bother you again. Their are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a someone that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it.

If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. Its always really important to tell a friend or a family whats going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends.

A problem is a chance for you to do your best. This statement is a really good statement because it really motivates people to face there problems, and get them out of there way. I agreed to this statement because of all the reasons I was talking about in the other paragraphs."
866,4256A9A1767F,"In my oppinion people should seek guidance from expercts and authorities about life's important matter instead of making thier own desisions. A few people may not agree, but I personally strongly agree with my oppinion is very important. I belive asking and sharing our ideas lead us to making better desisions. Here are three reasons why seeking guidence from expercts and authorities is better than making desitions on your own.

In addition, confusion is one of of the most common reasons why people end up making bad desistion. A lot of people might not know what it is going on or how to make a good desicion because it is probably their first time going through a situation they have never been in. I was not in a position to make my own desistions, because I was young and confused on what was going well untill I asked someone for help,but when I started making my own desitionsions

Also, it leads you to do better when you communticate with others and gives you a better understanding on why making your desision with others helps you out more. When I began to speak out about my desisions to my closest friends and they helped me make me feel that I was not going through it alone and they always made sure that the desision I understand the desision I was taking before even making my next move. It honestly helped me a lot.

Furthermore, it makes your life less stressful. You talked about what you were stressing about instead of bottling It all up. It is like some stress relive. For exapmple, you have a big heavey backpack full with books inside and when you get some out the way, you take some books out , and the backpack feels less heavy. I would feel relive on talking about what was stressing me out when I had to make a desision, because it is hard.

In conclusion, Not only do you make a desision but you uderstand, you communicate, and you feel relived about your desision. In the end of the day you would feel not only good about your desision but sure about yourself and the people around you. These were the three reasons on why you talking to experts and ahorities about life is important.                      "

Churchil,

Once he said ""The success consists of going from failure to failure right but without loss of enthusiasm"",

My oponion about the all this success is basic on Prime Minister Winston Churchill that he once said the success consists if you loss your enthusiasm i think he was exactly what he said about in persuit of success because the enthusiasm consist and how you going to be when you do something that you need to do right so you need to ge a great enthusiam for do it as well rifht if you do not do well its mean that your enthusiasm is what is success is passed from you was a one's of statement about the important role consist.

Some succes too is basic how you are if are good person sometime its mean that you controle a paper that if something is passed on you right that's mean that you need to get attention taht what you going to do in this time so this is one other effects that cause on you so i am agree with churchill's statement, but in the same time we can said its normal right because it how you feel tha's mean is represent your enthusiasm every time that you feel,as great or we said a mad perosn so the success i be comig in this point too becasue your accition is represent you feeling.

About the success that is consist if you going to failure to failure that the Forme British Prime Minister Churchill once said that that's meam if you main is great a or lower you need keep in your main that you going to do well and you need to be strong like one example,that if you think that you not do well you need stay attention that what thing is going to happen in the moment that success is be great or you can faiure too right but ist no mean that you stay with you head dowm right so, basic the Forme British Minister Winston Churchiil said about you think is that you success is not be right o can we said like bed so its mean that you going to failure, if without loss all your enthusiasm so i will said that all success is coming from all that you think and its basic too accion that you well do. Success is basic in what is going to happen bewteen that person accion so its mean that the person and their success it play one paper that you don't or i going to explain as never give up to other thing that just come to all your succes that was some reason you think that your enthusiams is going dowm so its one of importat point that need to show.

The statement about how is such importnat to role that failure plays in pursuit or success is the is that some activity are like pursuit is a important role because failure plays with success its basic that depents some activities that you can do is coming from pursuit right then usually you can see how success is work is basic a important role in this stament because success are principal thinks that each person show when they act then after they actuation so the consists is coming that which its mean that you can failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm i well said thay i am gree with Former British Minister winston Churchill Because the succes is part the us right as i said you need stay as much attetion because enthusiams is be coming that what should that you success is going to be great or youn can lost too in the moment is coming the accion for something that you well do like to said you acction represents off thing that wiil you doing right so is a important role that we can see and each person how pursuit work bewteen the consists like as person can be result, for each statement.

569,2B69ADAD868C,"""some people may say that growth does not depend on doing something beyond what they have, for it is not unnecessary.'' However, that is a fallacy idea because we all know that is not true. Wise people believe that doing something beyond what they have will make them grow as a person, both physical and mentally. Unless people try to do something beyond what they have already mastered, they will never grow, because growth comes from doing something that someone has never done before, it comes from trying out new things, boost up our confidence and makes us progress.

Doing something beyond what we have already mastered, will make us try out new things that will help us move on further. trying new things is the only way we can know what we are capable of. for example, i remember trying out something new which was beyond the things i knew, i felt different and new. the feeling that i felt was growth. Trying is what makes us know who we are and what we are capable of.

If people do not do something beyond, how do you expect them to grow, when growth is defined as making progress in what someone does in his life time. growth is producing new things that has never been done before making someone realize how good it is to do some that is convince and improve in our skills. Not doing something beyond is as good as not growing. doing something beyond will boost up someones confidence in doing things. the ability to try new things beyond what we have already mastered is what we call self-esteem that alluded from confidence. How would someone have confidence when they do not try new things.

Thinking beyond the box , makes some people become dogmatic with affirmative thoughts, because they would always want to do something with diligent. how do can someone expect a person with fallacy ideas become dogmatic? For example, how can someone define a person who does the same thing over and over without changing? It becomes irritating and unpleasant. growth comes from the things that we do beyond what we have already mastered.

Some people might say, "" it is not necessary to do somethings beyond what you already have because, having excess of something is not good.""however, that is not right, we all know that having something in excess will always push us to doing more things. for example, Trevor Noah once said,'' nothing is enough not until you die from it,"" meaning nothing will never be too much. The more we try doing something beyond the more we intend to learn. we all learn from doing something that is beyond our imagination.

Unless we try to do something beyond what we have, we will never grow, because growth comes from doing something someone has never done, it boost our confidence, and makes us become dogmatic with positive thoughts. doing things beyond, will always produce good results at the end, such as, advancement, making progression in our daily life. I firmly believe that doing something beyond what you have, will boost someone's confidence because each day i try out new things and all i get i enthusiasm of doing more."
3513,EF7E0CBD62D2,"I am agree whit this statement about the importance of attitude. because If you have good attitude, you can thinking carefully about the life we commit error every time. But we can learn the a adult he can give me a good advice.

If you have good family your attitude can be patient with the other people i know some time we keep bad moment but you can step out with your friends and forget everything, and you can reflect very wall your parents can be teach, good thinks and they can give you a advice for your, life some people dont like give you advice because they said we dont matter the life. some people said the adolescent not matter how they said but we are conscious the outcome.

My opinion is important to do good think in your life. Because the people remember like a good person they dont said something bad of you is important to have good attitude because is mirror how you are,in the school you need to have a good attitude because you dont want problem with the other people.

I remember some day my grandparent told me dont get problem because is bad attitude what you show to the other people you will prepare for the future when you are adult you know how to do with your boys you have good experience to show they and they can believe you.

I believe we know how to solving a problem because you need to thinking carefully and you get the answer for your problems."

People can check out books,shop,and play games without speaking to another persons .Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on people's lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. People shouldn't spend most of there time on devices or inside. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. How nice people are to them .

First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you won't meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. that effects a lot of peoples lives.

Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways.

Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. and our population will decrease because of technology.

In Conclusion, what the people are doing isn't right technology shouldn't keep us away from each other. we as people should stand up for each other. we should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other. Not away in our houses getting what u want from online and letting people you haven't meet and hadn't meet you determine who or what u are let your friends say what they thing and u tell yourself who and what you are."

Do you think that it is a good idea to change the school menu? Students are the only person who can choose what they want to eat. Students might prefer eat a hamburger than a salad. Changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea because students might be allergic of some types of vegetables and students' favorites food would be eliminate.

To begin, changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea because students might be allergic of some type of vegetables. For example, Generic_Name is allergic of tomatoes and lettuce. If the school menu changes then Generic_Name would not go to the cafeteria during lunch. Because of his allergies, Generic_Name have to stay away of those kinds of vegetables. For students like Generic_Name, the principal should reconsider the idea of not changing the school lunch menu. Overall, the change of the school lunch menu would not be benefit for some students.

Secondly, changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea because students' favorite food would be eliminate. For example, some students' favorite foods are pizza and hamburgers. If the school cafeteria changes its menu then many students would not eat because the cafeteria would not have their favorite food. For those students who would not eat, the school cafeteria will waste the food. Overall, by changing the school lunch menu can lead the cafeteria to waste food.

Some students might argue that changing the school lunch menu is a good idea. They argue that by changing the lunch menu students will have a healthier life. This point has merit; however, the change of the school lunch menu is a bad idea because others cannot decide what students should eat or not. Although, students will have a healthier life, other people cannot decide what students should eat.

In conclusion, changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea because students might be allergic and students' favorite food will be eliminated. For example, if the school lunch changes then it will have disadvantages for some students. Second, the cafeteria can waste food if they decide to change the lunch menu.

1955,93B8C8DAFE20,"Doing projects at school is really fun when it comes to working in groups. I think working in a groups is more beneficial because of the extra help you'll have. You wont have to work a lot because your group will help and share the project so that everyone has a chance in it. Group projects will show you how to work with others and maybe even help you make new friends. Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from.

Working at school is hard. You get lightheaded and maybe even get tired. Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice.

Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because you'll need teamwork for your life time. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another.

Projects of all kinds have to look good. Lets say your having a hard time trying to find the perfect color background for your poster. You can talk to your classmates who are in your group and ask them if they have any ideas of what color you should pick. Together you can find the perfect color and together you can make your project look perfect and maybe be the one that has the best project in your who class.

Group working is so much better for everyone because you'll learn teamwork, learn that you'll always have help when you need it, and your projects will always look good and perfect. The more people in your group, the more help, care, and ideas you'll have for your project. You'll learn something new from all of this and others will to. This is why I think working in groups is more beneficial for schools and jobs. "

3376,E8BFE6D45E41,"I think older kids should not be pair with younger kids because they can be a bad example,not being good around young ones, and not respectful to younger Kids

I think the should not be pair with younger kids. If a older kids does something bad the younger ones might do it to. It can go super wrong like if a older kid does a trick in a skateboard. The older knows how to do it. But the younger does not know how to do it he can break . Something arm or leg. One my brother was with his friend doing trick on his skateboard and i tried to do it but i fell and Brock my arm.\

I think older kid should not be around younger kids. Because they can be on drugs or be smoking who knows. That bad for younger kids if a kid see you smoking all the the smoke can go to his lungs and maybe give him cancer or die. My fiend Generic_Name brother was smoking around us we told that smoking can kill us and him bu he didn't Leasing.

I think older kid should be respectful to younger kid and everybody. So they don't to be like them if you're respectful to other younger kids can be respectful to others. But if you're not respectful other are not going to be respectful. One my friend brother was not being respectful to us so we were not being respectful to him.

This is why i think older kid should not be around younger kids. There not respectul,bad example and there not good around young kids. If the were repectful,responsible it would be ok around younger kids."
436,20E2B07931F3,"Once in a while we all have been heard a phrase; ""TRY, TRY, UNTIL YOU SUCCED"". We all have been gone through failing, at some part of our lives. But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who don't agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things.

We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience.

On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things don't give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard.

There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday won't give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But that's not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. let's just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didn't knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didn't even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today i'm really good at playing guitar.

There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and don't try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. I'm not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it.

In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you.                       "
500,25F1B2374A32,"Have you ever felt like you needed the guidance of another person? Many people have felt that way. It's never bad to ask for help or guidance from another person to get through things. Although having your life runned by someone else, seeking guidance isn't such a bad thing, because for some people making a big decisions on their own could be hard and stressful, and you could also be guided into a good and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas.

A reason people should seek guidance is because for some people making a big decision on their own could be hard and stressful. But having someone there with them while making the decision would be more than helpful and could possible reduce the stress they have. For example my cousin would get very stressed out when she had to make big decisions on her own. But when she had someone there with her or she asked for help she wasn't as stressed as she was when she had to decided on her own. Making decisions on your own is hard and intimating, so why not seek the guidance of someone else to help get though that tough decision making?

Another reason seeking guidance is a good idea, is because you'd be guided into a better and healthier life style where you are making better decisions and ideas. As an example one of my closest friends was going through a dark time in her life and was making poor decisions. But she found someone she looked up to and asked for their guidance. So they guided her to a better life style, where she now makes better decisions than she did before. All because she had someone to guide and help her. Guidance really does play a big role in a better life style and better choice making on people.

However one might say, ""well your life is being runned by another person."" But it really isn't being runned by another person, because you also have the choice to listen to them or not. Or that your mentor or whoever is guiding will tell you what to do or how to live your life. In some cases they do tell you how to live your life, but they tell you how to live a better and healthier life, but can't force you to change in any way.

Having your life runned by someone else isn't ideal but seeking guidance isn't the worse idea because you'd be guided in good ways such as a better life style and could be guided through big hard decision making. In conclusion I believe peoples lives wouldn't be horrible with the guidance of someone because they aren't only guided you to better your life but they are also helping you with hard decision making and getting through things."
3902,FFA3D98123DC,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success because in life no matter what you do you need a positive attitude. for example when you go for a job interview you go into the place with a positive attitude of you wont get the job. its like getting a job you have to have a positive attitude when your working with your others or with customers. i think that in life everyone needs a positive attitude to accomplish there goals. I think that people that doesnt have a positive attitude wont get very far in life. because when i was in middle school i never had a positive attitude and i would get into a lot of trouble because of my attitude, and now that my attitude has changed im becoming successful in life. i think that in everything you do in life requires a positive attitude. you need a positive attitude when your talking to people. if you have a negative attitude people wouldnt want to be bothered by you because people dont like to be around people with a negative attitude. for example when you have a positive attitude people would like to be around you then to be around someone with a negative attitude.

being positive is the key to success because if your being negative your not going to be successful in life.    "

We can achieve many goals by making things work the way we want it. And we do accomplish more when we are always doing the things we have to get done. It helps you a better person.

It is fantastic when you achieve your goals, because you can see the effort you put to get things done.

Help homeless who does not have food or somewhere to live. By starting on making an effort, and changing life's we can help homeless. Sometimes they feel like they dont have no one. Help others and you will have done many things for the future of someone. And whenever you need help someone will help you back. Give back what you receive and be kindness.

You will be successful when you accomplish your goals, or helping others. We accomplish more when we do good things for people that really needs it. We can do it ourselves to see the different in the things or gaols in this life.

In my conclusion, you must help others because whenever you need it they will help you back. Be different from others, never let others tell you cannot do it. Because if we do it we accomplish more, and we feel honored to see someone else happy for what we been doing or accomplish our goal. We can do it even if they let you down telling you, you can not do it. Must people dont like to see you accomplishing your goals, they feel unless because you did try, even if they told you you couldnt do it. Accomplish what ever you want in life to be successful, and if we are always doing something we will get to where we want to go."
2737,C968149003DE,"So many people at my middle school want to start a after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids won't turn in there homework. Also another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if there only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject I

don't think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework that's not enough time to finish homework and learn.

And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just cause they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with there friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn being a middle school er my self I have seen how most kids with there friends u would think that they are mauter but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have goin't chances but they keep doing the same thing.

As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when there's no after school so this after school program will not work for many reason like no a enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want ot play and not do work and volunteering kids dont want to stay extra and kids won't pay anttion to the teacher. "
2566,BEE04EB31D59,"What is the best leaning environment? Working in groups or working alone? Some people like to work in groups and others like to work alone. Many people have their ways of learning certain things. Some may like working in groups because it makes the work easier, bring up their confidence and social life. Others may like working alone because it helps people concentrate, they like to get their work done faster and they don't feel uncomfortable towards other people.

First, Working in groups might make the work easier, help bring up their confidence, or their social life. It can make their work easier by separating the work to make it faster to deal with the work. It can help bring their confidence by talking to other people. It can help them bring courage to make new friends and learn about each other. It can also help them with their social life. Instead of being on their phones they are learning together and getting work done. They are also getting to know each other.

Second, Working alone can help people concentrate in their work, they could be fast workers, and they don't feel uncomfortable towards new people. It can help them by concentrating in their own work to feel more comfortable with themselves. They could be fast workers because they are not being distracted and they can go on their own speed. They won't feel uncomfortable or awkward by other people because some people don't like meeting or being with people. Most of them just want to be alone or with people they might know.

All in all, find what you feel more comfortable with it could be being alone or being in a group to study with people you might want to get to know or with your friends that your comfortable with. Working alone is the best choice for most people because they might be able to work faster, they are fully concentrated in their own hard work and they might just feel comfortable with themselves."
3507,EF45D0314A20,"Almost 95% of people goes to the beach or swimming pools, and I imagined what enjoyable activity to do. I think swimming club is the most enjoyable activity. Swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, I can also swim with my friends and play together, and it is also more easier and exciting to exercise whenever i'm swimming.

First of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever i'm mad or feeling down. Last year, when the school just finished, and all of the people left, I jumped into the pool and just swam. It made me happy because as I swam into the surface of the water, I heard the water droplets drop as I moved my feet up and down, the sound of the wave made me sleepy as they touched the wall, and the sound of the gushing water that made me feel alive as I went out of the pool. Another example would be, when I was on a field trip, we all went to the beach and stayed there for two days. As the day goes by, I was sad and upset because I didn't want to leave. What I did was I changed my clothes, took my camera, and went outside. As I walk on the sandy beach, I heard the waves as if they were ready to eat me, I heard the birds chirping as I take a picture of them. It was a very fun and calm day. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm.

Second of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends, even make new friends! An example would be when I was swimming alone, I was okay because I don't really mind being alone, but when my friends came, they instantly made me laugh. All of us were doing tricks and racing with each other, which is very fun. One time, when my friends was swiming underwater, they bumped each other's head and as they reach to the surface, three of us laughed. Also, learning how to swim is easier because swimming is fun, and it's more fun with your friends. An example would be your friend can help you out when you're struggling how to float. Even doing dog swim is hard for some people, which is easy for me. Also, learning by yourself isn't fun, learning with your friends is more fun. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends.

Lastly, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it's mpre exciting to exercise when you're swimming. I once took a swimming lesson every friday after school. I didn't like it at first, but as soon as my third day came, I liked it so much. I gained 145 pounds for a ten year old, but when I took my swimming lesson, my weight decreased to 111 pounds. You don't really see the result, until you started having fun on what you're doing. An example would be I was really not into swimming and all I wanted to do there is to lose weight. I didn't see any improvement onj my swimming skills, and I didn't lose weight at all. Weeks passed and I started losing weight, and im becoming more better at swimming. I thought is because I got more passionate and determined when swimming that I didn't see those changes. After all what i've been through, swimming made me happy at all times. That is how swimming impacted my life.

It's more exciting and easier to exercise when swimming, you can swim with your friends and play together, and it helps me calm whenever i'm mad, and that is why swimming is an enjoyable activity. It is important for people to know this is because this is a real life story. It already helped three people when they read this. Swimming club is an enjoyable activity."
3306,E52BD4FC3FF0,"Have you ever done a enjoyable educational activity. It is fun because you can play instrument, make a science fair project, or act in a play.

The reason why playing a insturment is fun you can play instruments such as play the tuba,clarinet,trumpet and many more you can also preform at a concert in school or out of school those are all the reasons I think playing a istrument is a enjoyable educational activity.

Next, are the reasons why completing a science fair project is also, a educational activity you cn do many projects like figure how long it takes until a apple rotts, or even see how far your paper aiplane will fly those are all the reasons why doing a science fair projectis a enjoyable educational activity.

Third, why I think acting in a play is a enjoyable educational activity. One of the reasons why i think this is because you can wear a costume, preform on stage and, also read plays from william shakespeare.

Those are all the reasons why educational activity's are enjoyable.        "
3164,DEC2349902F8,"I disagree with the school bored adding one and a half hour to school each day. Because students will have to wake up very early everyday and get out from school late that's messed up to do to us like every class will be like more than a 1 hour and 30 minutes of class time hell no. I will die having a class like that but. I hope we have gym for 2 hour and 30 minutes everyday that will be fun but without having health and I will be so happy if we never have 5 sol every year like 2 or 3 is fine but 5 no that's to much sols for 1 year like the county is so mean to us but it's all good and having recess like what I had when I was a little boy.

I think when i get older I want to be a soccer player or a basketball player but I do not know yet like when my dad was a little boy he was poor and he want to be a soccer player but his dream never became true but when he came to the united states he went to her don high school for 2 or 3 year and than he learned how to speck engli8sh and got to play for the schools soccer team.

I think school is not that hard but for some people it is but the hardest class for me is Math and

History that all the class that I hard for me the other class are not that hard for me.......... "
776,3C2AFBFEDA6B,"Although most people would want to graduate and enter college or the work force a year early,others may argue that school should be the four years. One should be allowed to grow up. It should be mandatory to do four years of high school and here is why.

First of all,school prepares students to face up and go against the real world,some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that they're taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes.

Second of all,students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three year only, they cant take breaks and if so the students wont have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked.

Some may argue,that students staying for three years are going to have enough knowledge to be able to take on the real world. However,students that have four years would have a more since of what they are going to do after the four years have passed. In conclusion,students should stay and have a better understanding of what is going to come up next."
1078,52A8DE60E2D4,"Imagine a world thats black, gray, dead, full of people with depression, this could happen because of how people think that small kind acts couldn't help others at all.

These small acts of kindness could benefit the whole world, change it too. This could Create self reputation. Self reputation can be created a lot of different ways, but one kind and easy way is by being kind to others around you, this could help create or maintain relationships of any kind, another way this could benefit you is because sometimes other people will be nice to you in exchange this could impact you and others immensely, i know this from experience because sometimes i just give a simple short compliment to others and it lights up their day, and sometimes when i am feeling down and its noticeable, people are nice to me in exchange. This would make you more noticeable anywhere, people will know you as the kindest guy/girl around, so then people will ask you for a compliment or they will be nice to you.

This next way i will be talking about could really help out our community, or even the whole world. This could change the world because, the world we live in is pretty corrupted in many ways, but we could change that by being nice to others, for example if you are nice to someone they are going to feel happy so that person would want others to feel happy so he is kind to others, so it basically just loops, if more people are kind then the more people they will influence causing more people to be kind. This could give others the reputation they want, like being more noticeable, i know this because it happened to me, i had just decided to be kind to others around my school, and it made me more noticeable, causing other classmates to be nicer in order to be more noticeable, so everybody wins practically.

Lastly a really kind way to impact others with kindness is, you could make them feel better about themselves, like Aesop said, ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."" Like complimenting someone could make their day, and this impacts them and others around that person because they noticed that someone had been nice to that person and had made their day too, because it's wholesome. You could change peoples lives, like it changed mine, i was usually around 11 years old, and i had some trouble at school and home, but the people that are my friends now, just made my whole year, maybe my whole life because i knew some of them were going to stay with me till the end. You could be kind to someone that really need support, like people that are having trouble at home and school, this could change their lifestyle into a more happy way.

These are all reasons why no matter how small and act of kindness can be it could really change someones life. "

306,164D6D056A48,"I have a awesome talent, that is making weird high pitch noises. I make the noise sometimes, But in elementary school I made the noise all the time. When I found out that I could make the noise it was in 1st grade.

I made the noise all the time, I could do it and no won could stop me except myself. The only reason I really never stopped was because i made my friends laugh and i made jokes. The first example was I making what does the fox say and I made my weird noises. The second example was I randomly out of nowhere I slowly looked at my friends and stared right at them and i quickly made a lobster position and chased them well making the noise. I make a lot of noises at school but at home its even worse.

When am at home thats when I strike with the noises. I really liked annoying my sisters all the time. But, they punched me because I was being annoying because I always made the noises. The first reason they would punch me was because I sat right next to them and started making the noise, and less the two seconds she punched me really hard on the shoulder. The second reason was when I went in my sister room and started pocking her when i was making the weird noises and she got so mad she punched me on my chest that really hurt. But, now I really don't make the noises anymore i got tired of it myself. But, I do it on accident sometimes when im playing games.

I found out I had a talent and that was making high pitch noises And I used a lot. I made my friends laugh hard and made my sisters hate me a lot but i had fun with it. I made jokes one is what does the fox say and i made my high pitch sounds. the other was being punched by my sisters on the shoulder and the chest "" man the chest one really hurt"". But im pass that i may on accident do sometimes but other then that im done with it for good this time."
14,011AAA636F11,"Have you ever solved a math problem in less than 30 seconds? Math is important to many people. Even president Trump uses math to buy food or pay back to important people. He might be paying people to find a cure for the Coronavirus. However did you know that we use math every single day in our life?

How do people use math every single day you may ask. When you go to the super market to buy food, the register has to add all the food that you bought and they even have to add taxes. How about when you go shopping in the mall with some friends. When some is looking for a job they even have to find out how much is the salary. When your parents pay water bills and taxes, they have to pay the perfect amount of money. If your doing a party you have to find how much money your wasting. In your school you have to use math in mostly all your subject. In science you have find out how much of a mass is in a cup of water then subtract it from the cup to find the mass of water. For history the president has to find out about expensive's and the taxes that each citizens is paying. If you have a hobby or have talents to do an activity you even use math. In theater arts you have to measure and subtract where the lights are hitting and you have to find the perfect angel. In baking you have to add your ingredients and weight it to find it's mass.

When you cook don't tell me you just put random stuff in your pot. You have to find the perfect amount to feed the people you are feeding. In soccer you have to find the angle you are going to kick the soccer ball. Basketball is the same, you have to see from which angel you are going to throw the ball to make a point for your team. Here are some school activity's that you use math in your school.

However several kid's don't like math but they could try it in a fun way. Many children complain about math being to hard or just being boring. I have found a way to make it exciting for kids. They could be playing games or just pretending to buy stuff, like doing a little play that won't cost money. If a student likes painting give them a coloring book that has math in it. Dancing and music is the same thing like coloring. In music you can count how many strings a violin has and compare it to another instrument that is in the violin family. You can watch a funny video that is related to math, you can watch it in your home or in school. Go on a field trip that will be free or that won't cost that much money.

If a student is struggling in math help or show them a way to do it. A kid's classmates or friend could help them in math. They can use math websites like racing cars for boys and coloring games for girls. If they are still struggling then ask there parents if they can stay or to get them a tutor after school. Find them a easier and understandable way to teach them math. The child's teacher can even play fun games with her students like Kahoot,Quizlet live, or even Pear Deck. You can give out prizes like candy or sticker's, that will probably get them more exciting.

Many scientist say that math is helpful to your brain and makes it healthy for you and your brain. You will acknowledge many ways to solve several math problems from years to years until you graduate from collage or high school. The reason why I choose to do my lesson about math is that I want kids to be independent and to get responsible when they grow up to be adults. "
1830,8A0A3FE01FE7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning won't give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and you'll be getting more physical help in a classroom.

Many like distance learning because it's more flexible, but because it's really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people don't like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means they're missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they won't care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""it's online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and won't have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done..

Numerous of computer's systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom.

All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesn't matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter. While students are at home they can easily get distracted and forget they have work that needs to be done. this will cuase many students to fail and would have to retake the course.

2776,CB7F46E1BDF6,"Having a good attitude in a difficult time is a great way to stay calm and talk to others with respect. I witnessed one day a new kid came to my school with attitude he was giving out everyone what they want like many people asked him where he was coming from he said ""I'm coming from

New York"". He genially answer their question with respect and calmness like one kid asked how old are you, He replied saying that ""I'm 14 years old"" Even though

Some kids were being rude to him some of them even try to bully him,but cause of his attuide no one couldn't do much. He had no problem talking with teachers and other kids cause he wasn't feeling shy to talk with them he was happy and he was making an eye contact with everyone he's talking with. The kid probably had fun he made new friends earlier than other kids that were new. So that's why having a attitude not always means bad. So is your choice to be whatever you want how you wanna be treated because if you gonna treat others with bad attitude you should not expect them to treat you with respect. You can have a attitude and you still can be good is not always bad."
1703,81218F777A2F,"Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. When you do not even use it half of the time. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.

Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.

Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.

There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.

Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons.                                   "
1465,71131D46F019,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. People think it is a good idea for students to have phones for educational purpose. I believe students should not have phones in classrooms because students could easily get distracted, they will not have the chance to learn better, and having a phone should be a privilege.

First reason why I believe we should not have cell phones for educational purpose is ,students will get distracted. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.

Second reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.

Last reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Even if they put strict rules students will find a away to go around those rules.

In conclusion, this is why I believe some schools should not allow phones in classrooms. Students will get distracted, they will not get the chance to learn more, and having phones is a privilege. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.        "
1895,8EE0540E163D,"First of all Thomas Jefferson have wrote a great and wondeful idea how can we get done any goal we planin to get done. We all know it is hard to done someting we will use on our future, but when dono it the first time the secound purpose will be much esily. however to accomplish a goal any one has to work hard and fine out to get it done.

How to get done our purpose and goal, all of use need to fine out how to get done some things ca happen many obtacle beffor get to the pupose we planign to get done we all know wil take a long time is not goin to happen jus with one person it will be hard to get there.

On otherhan it is a gret idea to be to accomplish what we what or we love to do on our rest of life becouse will make you a great person or a exemple for others."
473,23B40A807A4E,"It is wonderful to accomplish something that you really want by working hard you can get it, and when you have already accomplish that goal or dream you fell so great that you did it. ""Like my mom always said to me that in this life you have to work hard to get what you want.""

First of all,

My mom work cleaning houses she work hard to give my sister and I the things that we want, and she always have a goal to work by her self and have her own cleaning jod. Not working with a company that they make her work hard and pay her little money, when my mom came to his country [U.S.A] she start working for a women that women put her to do alot of house and pay her little money and when my mom told her that she was giving her alot of work she was angry at my mom. My mom then she start workin give another women that do the same thing they do twelve houses everyday my mom was so tired and not only that there was another women taht was working there that she hate my mom all the time they have problems. My mom don't want that anymore and now my mom have her own job she one or two hause everyday and in a week she make five or eight hundrent dollars she have work hard to get want she wants.

secondly, My parents want to buy a house to have our own house and that renting a aparment that is so small that a house and have our own space. My sister and I we were sharing the same room and we always have problems because she always have leave trush in the room she didn't pit it up I always have to do it and I was tired of that. Living in a aparment you don't have a space to plant flowers or playing around with your cousins. My parent they always were going to the bank to take up a loan but they couldn't beause they didn't have a good interentest and they continue to go to the banks and woking hard to have good interentest in the bank and fine they get it. My parent buy a hause and we have like six or seven mounth that we are living in that house.

Also, I have a friend that she study hard to have good grades and a counselor from the school call her that want to talk to her that she can calify to a university for having good grades. She went have to go for a mounth to stay in that university to know how is live of the university and compete with other students, then that same counselor take her to Generic_City for a fiel trip to go and see some people that will sing in a famouse place. She have work hard to get that things that she have get.

Accomplishing same thing that you really want a great thing beause you can have a better future and have a great life. Sometimes is hard and challenge you said I cannot to these anymore but you can do it but you have to work little hard to get there. Sometimes it is very challengeful for some people but they break that barrier that stop them to continue but they do it why other people can we are the same. "
2441,B558AFC603D4,"There was a girl named Generic_Name, and she wanted to play violin like she used to. Generic_Name was struggling. It was not easy on getting back to playing it. Generic_Name practiced everyday no matter what. Generic_Name made a lot of mistakes on the way, but successed at the end. When you accomplished something; you have failed before you could have successed. Failing can cause before you succeed because you try to get where you are, you make mistakes, and you can make the wrong choices.

To begin, failing can lead to succes because it happen before you succeed. For an example, you tell yourself that you will get your work done for all of your classes. Then you end up not understanding the work, but tried and turned it in the work. It can also be doing all your chores before you could go out and be with your friends. For another example, you had a lot of chores to do. It was getting late and you have finished all of your chores. At the end you could not go out, but finshed with all of the chores. It can also deal with reading a book. For an example, you want to read a hard book and finsh it, but you end up reading a different level and finshed the book. These examples show that you fail before you can succeed.

Secondly, failure happens before you can accomplish anything because everyone makes mistakes. It can be when someone is trying to make a cake. For an example, you try to combine the inderigdeints, but they were not the right indergridents, Then next time, they put in the right inderigents. It can also be about when someone is trying to practice on their drving skills. For an example, The driver prcatices everyday, but makes many mistakes. Later on, gets better at it. People can aslo make mistkes by giving poeple directions on where to go. For an example, a lady needed help to get the location at the supermarket. The lady asked an old man where it was. The old man gave the direction, but made a mistake where the superamlrket was at. Then the old man told the lady that it was the other way. All of these examples show that mistakes can happen before you can success.

Lastly, failing can cause by just making the wrong choice. Such as a girl wanted to tryout for outdoor track, but she loved playing softball. The girl tried out for track and made the team. There was a problem, she couldn'[t be on the softball team because it was too late. The softball teamwas full. At the end, the girl should of made a better choice. It can also be about how you want to turn out your day. For an example, the boy wanted his day to be fun, but the boy was paying attention in his classes so he was sent to the offfice. This turned out to a bad day. Then he apologized and made his day better. This all shows that making the wrong choices can lead to failing on what you decide.

This all sums up, that failure can cause before you succeed. Others say that failure does not happen when you succeed, however, I say that it does play out before you can success. Failing will always occur when you succeed. You push yourself where you want to be, you make errors, and doing the wrong decision are all reasons why failure can happen before you can success. Do you think there is failure even when you succeed. "
1612,7ABD75EA7CBC,"Imagine going to school everyday to learn and experience new things, when it comes to lunch, students are ready to eat and enjoy there favorite food with others but the principal made an announcement about changing the lunch system by getting rid of junk foods to healthy foods. Students favorite food being replaced by healthy food will be a nightmare to them. No more pizza, burgers, spaghetti, etc, will be all gone and will cause a problem. Removing students favorite food to healtheir ones will be a bad idea. Students will dislike eating healthy food, and students will feel hunger and lose concentration in class.

Firstly, Some students will dislike some healthy food that they don't enjoy. For example, Generic_Name goes to lunch and sees the only food aviliable is a salad. He never ate salad before but sees a lot of vegetables including lettuce, tomatos, onions, etc. He feels disgusted by the food he was serve and rather starve. What I mean is that students being served to vegetables which they won't take a bite of, won't make them eat because they don't enjoy eating vegetables that was served to them and might get student to not eat but starve which will be bad to there body.

Additionally, the students will be in bad shape during class time. They will feel hungry, sick, or possibly pass out. For example, Generic_Name came back to class from lunch and he didn't eat anything because of the food that was serve. While doing class work, Generic_Name doesn't feel well and his stomach starts to growl because he didn't eat anything. He will lose focus and will start begging for food. What I mean by that is students in class will feel hungry and there stomach will soon to growl and will lose focus on class instructions. The principal should not make these changes and keep the system of lunch the same because there body will be in good shape and will gain energy through out the day.

Some people will disagree my reasoning and opinion on changing the school food system to healthier ones is a bad idea. They will say say it's a good idea because they will consume healthy foods that will make students grow stronger, will have a healthy diet, and be more energized within there life.

That may be true but that's not the case because student are comfortable on what they eat and what suits them will suit there future lifestyle. Thus, changing students favorite food to healthy ones in lunch is a bad idea."
3578,F1BB39C5E549,"In a centair time, many of us think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. We the students treat the must that we can do to us califications. Exist a controversy,

that is how more we ca have concentration during the assigments in class.

I think these thow ways of work , can get a good results. Because working with a group or with ourselves , oneself have the responsability to concentrain and do our work. It is only put us effort to aprove classe.

When we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. We can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments. Also help to ourselves when one of the group don't usterstand about the topic. Even if the assignment are complete ,

the rest of the time the members maybe can talk to each other.

But this happen also when the students have a good communication and they are friendly. However sometimes can be difficult even the sudents don't try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself.

Sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate.

Students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. Working with a group students can be more fiendly with anothers students of differents countries and they can be more caring.

Students can show their abilities and be more prepare when they get a job. Also students learn more of the members . In totality this is a argument to the students that they can't work alone , but they have the opcion to work with a group to prepare.

In conclusion , I agree that is more better to work with a group in class than alone . It is a benefits to discover new people, hear more ideas,

and be fliendly. I think is more helpful to students do the assigments in class. Work alone can be difficult , but sometimes these help oneself to be indepent . It is more great have a goup with members that gonna help. It is only concentration in a group or not , beacsuse oneself need to be more improve everyday and pass classes. Work with effort , the students always need help in study in class is a benefit when students see all persons equal to working.     "
3470,ED6070D470FF,"I despise it when someone your close to says ""you can't be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior.

Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend's baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that's all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that can't be used in a school or around familly is your best bet.

A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they're praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if they'll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now.

No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person's behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model.      "
1526,757C5E55BA96,"I think it is a good idea that people should ask for others peoples advice because they can learn extra info from them. Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people. They can also get help someone make a better choice. You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next.

The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions. The more people ask for advice they will get multiple opinions. If I dont ask questions iill never get any responses or advices. So thast why I think people should ask for others peoples advice all the time.

575,2BAF09F7004D,"As we know the modernization through the years is bringing us new advances in technology. One of the most important and positive effects of use of technology is make life more easy for everyone. I mean, the use of social media is given us a lot of way to communications no matter where we are; the facilities of communication and information on time are essential to accomplish many task. The complexity to communicate and create different way to interact had making a great way to a efficient communication.

First of all, the use of technology is currently having big impacts in our lives. It is changing through the years the way how the humanity is living. There out are a lot of brilliant brain creating new advances in technology everyday. The expansion of the new advances day by day is given us a renovation of our life style. The interactions between everyone through communication using different devices such a computer, phone, iPad, etc.. The principles of those project of advances created and expended by people expert in technology; the've been implement the necessity of technology in every single places. It can also influenced our mental and physical health; depression and anxiety are common nowadays so there are website to providing helps online. The variety how we can combine knowledge in technology are infinities. That is one of the main reasons.

Secondly, we are breaking all the limitations that we had before. If you are trying to communicate and if you were in large distance was limited because we did not have those resources such a Mobile devices. So now, we are currently, sending messages or texts, even we can do video calls on live simultaneous. This factor was not possible without the technology. Everyone is connected around the world. Those limitations are breaking because all the different social media:

Facebook: One of the most famous and popular website to post, share videos, photos, websites, links.

Twitter: This app is used mostly to post personal thought or opinions.

Instagram: To post and now with new implement of sources for marketing.

Gmail: It is one of the most popular account to mail. It is like Email but it is more modern.

Email: is mostly used to messages.

Blogs: is used to shared a personal version. It can be about life style, hobbies. Anything you want.

YouTube: This is a platform with the purpose of given us videos some of them can promoting companies.

In addiction, one of the important advantage is the facilities to do everything we want, when we want, where we want. The use of technology in school, colleges even work implement the easy way to accomplish everything. Now days, school bring to their students computers with the the purpose of advances in every single student to do their homework/assignments in home with all the necessary facilities. They want to give students information through books that you can easily get online. In the pass, it was impossible because you had to go to the library and get the permission to read a few books. So, now with the technology we can also use the technology with the purpose to sell or buy things online. Amazon is a good example of success marketing in the world. People buy things on Amazon because they do not have enough time to go to the store and buy their stuff. The platform of amazon is giving us enough details about those items that we want to buy. The majority of shop stores or companies have websites. This is creating a red of new jobs. Some people can work even in home using any device because technology is making that possible. Sometimes, the use of technology can be optional but something is a necessity. We have to adapt to the new modernization. That is because technology.

Although even, there are some statements about some negative effects of technology such a limitation of communication, I can prove with real facts how the technology facility the interactions of contact to other people for example: group chat, messages, Facetime, live videos. Students can be connected with their classmate or vice verse even with their teachers. They just have to be connected. Social media is creating a direct and indirect connection to others, I mean the students can have conversations about projects or assignments through their phones or any device. The use of technology can be fun. We can use technology in video games and some of them have communication though microphone and we can really interact with our partner. We also can extend the communication and interact not just once or two as many as we want. Technology is given is entertainment. Sometimes we just want to be in our conform zone and that is okay. So it's up to us if we want to work, play with somebody else or by ourselves.

It's true that we can decide if we want to work, have fun by ourselves but the technology bring us the opportunity to interact with others.

Finally, the use of technology is part of our lives already. We can deny the use of it in our daily activities. A simple example: If we are going to get a job, mostly of the applications are online. Every job is associate with technology. The use of them created good benefit in everyone. The effects of technology depends with the purpose we are using it. If our purpose is to using the technology to good benefit, the used of them will be successful either the purpose is about good or bad things.

""Every action, have a reaction"" Isaac Newton.

The results of our good action will always have a positive effect.

I can concluded, all those positive effects are making our work more easier. The use of technology in our society is impulsing us to be betters every day. All the results of hard works by every of us. The innovation of those advances are creating new mechanisms in our routine, new life style and all that is because we are smart enough to created technology, everything started from us. The majority of people is using technology with good purposes. The world is doing better because technology."
290,1594F1B5DED6,I remember when i was in my country my uncle have a little store and he was trying to grow but he try for much time but he see that his store looks sad poor so he close the store and was asking for help and just like 5 or 4 people help him and at the pass of the year we see him building a good house he grow inmediatly and people get surprised by him because a lot of people din't not beleave of him so people get mad of him because only because he grow and people don't want to other grow. the wheter is that you will never grow. i am agree that you can grow with what you have already my firs reason is that people can grow working hard like my uncle did because my uncle did work hard and that store is there because him. my second reason is work together look there are many games in this world but some of them dont like to work together so is a game called Pug mobile and the other game is Residential of evil and those game work together and they are getting good thing and that how every one need to do to grow my third reason is to be easy going to to be sad because you dont have nothing that how the biggest company start with nothing so that how people have to thing to be ungry to dream and if you take that seriously you will be someone in this life so work hard and never give up whem you fall stand up is no matter how many time you fall that inportant thing is to never give up some people may say look at that person he or she is crasy if that dont work just keep trying and you will see you grow.                                                                                                    
2515,BB0157B70CA5,"Homework can be hard most of the time, and you need someone to help you with it. Having an afterschool homework club can be fun and a good thing to do in school. An afterschool homework club can be good for the kids that don't get to finish their homework or don't understand the homework. On the other hand, we have the people that don't have time to do things after school.

An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People don't always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they don't have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that don't have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish.

I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I don't have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might don't have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it won't starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club.

Most of the students won't have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I don't think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I don't think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework.

It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that don't have time after school won't struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that.

Another good idea could be, that they can make the club at fist block, at the start of the day, like if one of the students never did their homework last night they still have time to finish it in the morning before they go to class. My favorite one was the one in the last class because, everyone gets a little break even the teachers. Everyone gets to finish their homework and no one has worrys about not finishing their homework and have a little bit of more free time in the afternoon."
1533,75DAA54880C1,"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, '' To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.

First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.

Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.

Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am.

To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are."
1958,93DF867BE1C5,"I am agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the persuit of success .The Success consists of going to faillure to faillure without loss of enthusiasm. Next the success consists in many things. For example the Prime Minester Wiston Churchill said that, because he always persuade . That the enthusiasm is it the most important to any business or personal in your life consist in that simple word.

First I think that prompt has a specific message that persuasive that everyone who read can reading the message. So if who read the prompt may perform their success and should not failure in the future business. Next the futere business can thinking about it. Then if they don't have any enthusiasm they won't have success in a not very far away future. Finally that is what I think about the prompt said Churchill's statement very important role that failure plays in the success.

First I think it is very important that statement role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Second if you persist and never give up you should be successful. Also if you are not persisting what you want with enthusiasm. That means you will have the same situation going to failure in your live. Then finally never loss the enthusiasm that is the point for all success.

For the success if you are unwilling have a little enthusiasm. So, as you are trying to do and you fail. It's only one reason that was not enough enthusiasm to doing it. You have to preform and trustly in yourself.

Also I think that success is for who are looking and persist with enthusiasm. Finally that is the enthusiasm consists in the future.

The important role from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I am agree with that statement said, you never think you cannot do anything. Also I think if you feel without enthusiam you always will failure. So if you purpose is the success you should hard work and don't feel you cannot. Then if you willing you won't failure. Finally I think just sometimes that if believe in yourself you may do anything including if you came from failure to success.     "
3247,E24ADB91F6D3,"I wrote a prompt to determine one thta people made bullyng to, it is really wonderful how people change when they know you, I did a lot to try to be fine with other people's,but not everybody is nice there are still some people to make bullyng or watever to you, they just don't try to meet the people they just perjudice the people without knowing them that's why i am always alone because to much people talk a lot of someone and i really don't like that the people be talking things about others and that the people that are the one's that are threat with bullyng they don't even say anithing of sacared of those people they think they can make bullyng to them.

I always try not to take care of what other people say they can talk whatever they want is their problem but when someone come's and they don't like that they can get hurt and there is when they look for you when they are in trouble, when i am angry or sad i just like to play soccer because that helps me to forget the problemsm that i got in my mind, if could it do something.

i would it try to make games of soccer so all the people that want to play soccer can get to do it and they can forgot their problems too. that's why sports are made because people can have fun without fight, and one more thing it can be is to go with friends to see movies or to watch soccer games or basket ball games or volleyball i don't know but there are a lot of ways to get to know someone, in my way i think that everything got a solution for the problems the problem is that we don't our respect to other people if we do it everthing it would be really different

Everything that we want is to be safe in a place where no gangstars are bbecause they only know how to make peolpe get more poor of what they are we should get involve all the families to try to destroy the people that are hurting others, alot of people try to study their best to be someone in their life they just want to get out their families out of trouble, out of bad ways, they can make alot of money easier when they finished ther school, only with high school finish you can get a nice job not a job that you would like it but you can get at least something.

People can be safe having their things like if someone try to take all that you had they just can go the police and tell them what happens and they might help them and they might help to try to recover what they lose people shouldn't be scared because when they show that they are scared other people can be smart and do a lot of things to thm just because they show sacared and all that we are people really smart but we sould be smart in everything because not because we are smart in some things it means that other people can be nice with you if you don't show angrily other people angry can hurt you in one way that it's going to hurt you a lot.

All people are nice but when they get angry or mad they change a lot they can be reall angry and you can be scared of how they can get, but for not having problems with someone you should just invite them to play sports somewhere or to have fun with your friends you'll can go to the beach and have a lot of fun there so the people can not get angry and it can get to be your friends forever or at least only friends, but no one should show their debil point because when you get a problem with your friends they would aready know what's the point that you would mostly hurt that's hy i think no one should know the most imporant debil point of your body or of you so this is my prompt thanks                                                   "

219,10988CD16BF3,"The beach is the best place on earth!! A beach is a place by the ocean with sand. Most beach's have a board walk where people can walk up and down for fun. There are always stores along the board walk that have amazing things for people to take back home. One place I would love to visit is Virginia Beach because the wonderful water. I would spend all day on the beach and most of the night on the amazing board walk.

When I would spend the day on the beach I would ride the big waves on my stomach even tho it hurts but its still fun. Also, I would go boggy boarding because its hard to stay on if you don't time when to jump on the wave right, I would usually bring my own board from home but the waves are so strong mine would brake and I would always have to buy a new one over there. My all time favorite thing to do is play on the sand when I to tired of being in the water for too long. I would usually build a long and tall sand castle then run throw it and get my mom mad because I just got sand all over her. Then my dad would dig a big whole in the sand then put me in it while my brother holding me down my dad would cover me with sand so that just my head would sick out, they would usually leave me in there for about 20 minutes or so

With this in mind, at night I would love going on the board walk and explore all the cool places. Most night there would be a band playing outside next to a Sonic fast food outdoor restraint and they would have a game where people can win two free meals if you guess how many Jolly ranchers are in the jar. Then me and my dad would rent bikes and ride all around the board walk for like an hour or so to see everything that is there. Once it hits like 10:30 my brother, sister, and I would go on the sand and find cool stuff on the ground with flash lights then we would all sit down, listen to music and talk for about two hours. At like 12:00 we would go back to the hotel and while my mom and dad sleep we would sneak out and go eat out at the 24/7 all you can eat restraint.

With all these fun ideas, I would love to visit Virgina Beach and have a great time with the family. Going on the beach for th day and the borad walk at night is the best thing to do."
218,108CA77CBAB4,"although former British minister Winston Churchill says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" actually to get to success sometimes does take failure to get it. actually this is very true for people who never give and work hard even after they fail time and time and again. for example when you fail at something to keep trying after till you succeed. some people think if you fail you won't be successful that is not true. if you never give up you will be successful. another example when you fall you always get back up and keep going and pushing forward. only you can decide if you want to always fail or try harder. to get success it ain't easy. there is a saying nothing that is easy to get is wroth having. this relates to what Churchill said. Winston Churchill is a wise man and i would agree with him. everything he said about failing and being successful after is true. they are so many successful people who have failed plenty of times in their life. it happens to all people no can be perfect at what they want or do in their life. inconclousion Winston Churchill is a wise man for his saying. his saying can motivate many people who feel like giving up after failing.

Career experience is important to human society because it is needed in order to earn money. Some school provide programs that have different career. Student can have experience on what is like in the outside world. Without the help of the school program lot of student have difficulty on finding jobs.

Graduating early means that a student have master they're learning. They have the opportunity to start there career that they enjoy and have the requirement. Pre-AP classes, also advance learning can give students scholarship. Pre-AP classes means learning College while in High School.

Recommendation also falls on the same place as graduating early and career experience. When a student have master there learning they get to go to a special school that is more advance than regular school. They have reach the point where they succeed in learning.

Career experience, graduating early, and recommendation are all benefit of advance learning. "

Accomplishing more if we are always doing something is a huge motivation for people because; it helps the person in many ways, they get benfits , and it helps them be productive. This is why each day we see more and more people becoming greater then what they already are in life.

When accomplishing more things if we always doing something, people seem to get or fine benefits by doing by doing this task. People are being able to gain more knowledge from this because, they're simply putting in lots of detication and time into always doing tasks.

Because in this world that we are living you will not go a week without somebody having to mess your day up.

Having a positive attitude, can sometimes be hard for some people it depends on how that day begins in how it ends. Life has a lot of choices and a lot of path you have the make you own choice im make your path with a negative attitude you can never accomplish anything. If you don't know how to treat people; you don't know how to act than you won't get anything possitive out of that.

472,239A72DE1E35,"Saving energy and resources

Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. Yes the school should follow the model by extending the school day two hours. It will save money for the schools. Students can have more time with teachers. Students can have a time to work at a job. Teachers get to have more time grading.

It will save money for schools. The reason I said that is because the transportations cost money and in four-days the school can save transportation money rather then five-days a week. The school can also save money on electricity on a four-days school week. Schools can save the money to help students to pay for their colleges. Schools can save the food to give it to homeless people.

Student have more time with teachers. Students can have more then 90 munites in class since is two hours extended. They get to have more time with teachers. They gonna learn more in class with more time added. They can really be organize, since they have four-day school and more time with teachers. That can help them learn about life even more.

Student can have a time to work at a job. I said that because most of the time when we have five days school. we can't work because we scared to fail our grade. if there is four days school and more time with teachers we can keep a good grade. And we can work two day and leave one day for study and family, since their's gonna be three days off.

Teachers get to have more time with grading. Their's alots of grading that teachers do so with three days off it can really help them with grading. Teachers can have enough to time to teach the class. They can have time to see every each student about their grade and see if they need help with any class works. It is great because teachers can have time with students and that's very important.

It is the best to follow the four-day school and extend two hours of the school day. It helps school with saving money. Student can have more time with teachers. Student have time to work at a job .Teachers have more time with gradings. It has so much benefits if we follow the four-day school and extended two hours of the school day. we should start writing to congress to change school into four-day work week.            "
3179,DF785B00E2A2,"I think to working in group will be more beneficial for me, Some reason the

I prefer to work in a group is becouse will can share ideas and opinions that way will be get better grade, Another examples will be, every one in the group will found diferent information and that way we can pick the better information before to proceeding to writng and finich the work.

And another hand my central opinion to work in group will give you the best beneficial because if one of the student get sick the other student can continued to work, that way we can not stop working. And alway work together will supported the idea with the specific information,

Another importan examples is if you working in group you can asked to you group for help, you can shere the work, either one in the group can provide the better ideas and following information in order,

that way all together we can planned the work before writing.

Athoner reason for work in group in my personal opinion is feel more beneficial because you not work alone, that way is less stresfull for each student because every one share the work.

And some time for one reason one of the student has a emergency and the position the best option is work in group because will be more beneficial for each student and the way all the rest of the group can countinued wokt.

and still whole group will be get same grade, however they work together in the group.

In conclusion working with a group is the best, in my personal opinion, I prefer to work in group because the way I improve my work,

working in group is the better way to work because we has many benefits like share ideas, imformation, etc,

and the end I hope you prefer aech student has to keeping work in group.

If we have confidence your own because we face with different kind of stutionan that we have to fight and difficult staff in life never give back keep working hard encourage find way that take of your stutional.

For example: If we start something new that took long time to resive that result we have to be patient for that greatest thing never get quickly every beginning took time for that accomplishment we are face diffcualte time like might field are might be win for first chance never lost our hope keep working hard.

don't depended to other people never improve in life because depended to other. In the world indefinite multitude or great quantity or distance make a difference a way. For all the world in every way ex acuity copies which look for all the world like the original. You should trying to become succeed in life to get of the way from problem find solution how to succeed in you're life.

First, trying as mach could doing make more successful this new world sometimes is life easy but, sometimes is not because life complicate and busy. If continue this way your life totally change working hard more successful and, more achievements.

3743,F90A25704212,"Have you ever been in class unsure about what your learning even though you have been paying attention? I'm sure that would be majority of upper classmen students. I can admit I've have been several of times, In my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. Students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class.

School can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. Then when the teacher explains it to you , If you don't understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. This can be avoided by the power of distance learning you'll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. You wouldn't have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. Also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you.

However some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. Working in a group at times might not always be the best option. When reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you're struggling with. Those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. If you're a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you.

Last but not least , Are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? You would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. In class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. When your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you're not told what time your suppose to start at. If your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. In my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to.

To sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. If your school is offering this to you I highly recommend it. It can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don't fall behind in class. You can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. And lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. This is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.             "
2255,A8F321EBF782,"Small acts of kindness can come for yourself and others. for example when you see someone that is siting alone at lunch you should invite them to sit white you. like this one time my fried and I were siting at a tad at lunch, then we sow a boy siting alone at a tad. So we desisted to ask him if he wanted to sit withe us and he side ""alright I wold love to."" after that we found out we have simpler classes as him. We all became good friends and weer still friends to this day so an act of kindness can make a friendship.

Moving to a new school can be herd. Because your living your friends that you had for a way you can make the new kid feel confab in school, by showing then were their classes are explaining some thing they don't understand and asking hem to sit with you at lunch and you and can help each other with homework you don't get. And show their around town and make them feel like there wanted in school, and you can show he or she the clubs after school and if you to have similarity showing some one you care makes them feel like their going to be okay at their new school and will proudly makes them feel more confident.

A nether way of showing an act of kindness is by listing to peoples and friends. pronouns beaus some times you fell down and have no one to talk to,so you can be that some one, listen, give advise and confert you have to let then know your their for them. And will listen to anything they say and they might feel cuffed talking to you.

234,112AA24D20BC,"Some years ago before my uncle became a doctor, I saw how he was struggling with anxiety attacks of too much studying time at medical school, but he noticed that he needed to do different activities to get distracted a little bit and at the same time get rid of all the stress. Every student participating at least in one extracurricular activity is a really good idea because they could do sports, get in book clubs or help around doing community service. If all the students would do extra activities , they're lives could be really different and better in many ways with variations of experiences and less stress.

Students doing any sports would be really helpful for their health. Mostly every student at school is seating on a chair for hours and at home they are probably just also seating on the couch for more hours . A human body needs to move and do some exercise to have a good health. Sports are really a good ting that makes your body feel or have some changes just like on teens they're metabolism makes them get taller or develop their bodies. Even if the students do just 20 minutes a day stills helpful for them.

Book clubs are something really interesting and fun for students to do. Do you ever just feel like your mind needs a break? Well books are the best option as a break , they take you to many different places around the world even places that dont even exist without moving from anywhere you are at. You can find new adventures, drama, romance and some things you never experienced; just like transferring your mind to another world, and distracting you from your regular life. Making you have and enjoy some good time without going somewhere. In the book clubs you can discuss with people about all those thoughts you have about what you just read, and could also find someone that thinks the exact same things as you.

Doing community service not only helps others, it also helps you! You might be asking yourself right now how? Well, helping your community it's teaching you as a student how important cooperation is , helping others brings you happiness, and that feeling of how responsible you are becoming. Also, community service helps students a lot with credits for an advanced diploma or even a scholarship for college. If you never have helped your community thinking is nothing fun, you should consider it as a extracurricular activity that you can do.

Every student should do an extracurricular activity after schools so theyre body and mind can have an productive break. Any type of activity helps you and relax's you when need a break. Choose something to do that you like and after school finishes then do everything you can in that time."
36,037ED3EA2982,"Do you think positive attitude is the key to success in life. I think it is because if you ain't positive you won't get no where in life. Think about it if your positive somethings in life will be easier then other things. I believe theres good karma and bad karma if your positive to people and help people out good stuff will happen to you that's called good karma. but if you bully kids, cuss at elderly and don't help people out karma is going to bite you in the butt. That's why it's always good to be nice to people you don't know even if they aren't good to you still be nice because at the end of the day good karma is coming to you.

Look at these famous people they made it out of the struggles because they worked hard and they helped people out. Some people don't get chances to show other people they talent if you keep working hard and get your mindset in the right place you will have a chance to make out the struggles. it's hard to make it out of struggles some people are working hard busting they butts and they barley get money to pay off the bills. Most likely the people that work hard are the people that have positive attitude not all the people that work hard because some people that work hard are rude and helpless. For the people that are helpless and rude won't get as far from the people that have positive attitude.

Positive attitude can get you a lot of good stuff in the future. As long as you stay positive and work hard you will be successful in life. Positive attitude will get you places in the future that you couldn't imagine when you was little. Although it's not going to be a easy road to get where you want to be you always got to try. See if your positive in your job and you help people out a lot people are going to start to like you that's one way to be noticed. I'd rather work hard with people I know are positive and helpful then working with rude helpless people.

Look at the people with negative attitude are they getting anywhere?. They ain't getting nowhere with negative attitudes. Usually the people with the negative attitudes are the ones that get bullied, ain't raised right, or they just won't listen no matter what you tell them. If they change they life around and start listening and respecting people they will get respect back. If you start switching your life up people will start noticing and they will be happy you. But some people won't change and they will get sent away to prison if they keep up what they do.

In the future always remember that positive attitude is the key to success in life. No matter what people say about you always stay positive don't let the negative people take you down because they said a bunch of nonsense about you that wasn't truth. Don't tolerate bullying either if you see someone getting bullied stand up for them having a positive attitude ain't only about yourself it's about helping people that needs help. I've seen videos of people sitting down on the bus and not move for a lady that can barley walk it shows you how people are now it's pathetic. I'd rather help people out and get known for it then get known for not helping out people.      "
3826,FC831CB27E25,"Although some people might say, if the students choosed a specific career at a young age it will help them to focus on their future. Choosing career at young age would make the student stressful, because the student will feel scare of failing in what he choosed, he dont have close people are supporting him for what he want, he choosed a career he doesn't want it because of few members of his family want him to be what they want not like as he want to choose. Having a specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, because in growing up more hard decisions the student will have so he has to choose the right decision, being creative at his career will let the student get a big succeed, and being already chosen a career is enough by itself to stay away of the people who failed in their life because they dont have a goal or career they can get.

In conclusion, choosing career at young age would make the student stressful, having specific career while being young student would make the student more responsible and creative of what he is going to do for his life with full of confidence, the student won't be worry if he is going to choose his passion, let the student take what he think its good for hisself."
3776,FA43581AD6D1,"Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""determine never be idle, it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."". I completely agree with this statement because if you do not want to do anything then how are you sure it will happen. If I want money and I do not have a job then how will I ever get money.

If you want a job and you only sit on your couch how will you get a job? The anwser to that question is you wont because you are not going out and applying for a job. You have to be active and you have to always keep looking until you have the job you want. Nobody will come to you and tell you

""Do you want this job?"". You have to get it and if you are not doing anything to get it nobody will. In todays society people do not want to be active in what they want to get, they want everying to be givin to them. How can we give people something they did not work for they need to be active and search for what they want to get it.

People may disagree with my statement and say ""You do not need to be active for things to be done or to get a job."". If you are not active then how do you know things will come your way. Everything you get in life is earned through being active and getting things done nothing comes at a snap of your fingers."
3050,D9B80F897473,"The better way to influence people to have good behavior at school or anywhere is to be a comppassive friend.

Giving advice, try to talk to them, Otherwise people does not have good behavior because sometimes they have a lot of problems at home. For example if i saw someone who is close to me like my best friend or something like that and they have a bad behavior.

I will try to find ways to helping being kind, nice, social and give new perspective to other people. Being good influence for them is very friendly, is good in all of the reason's. The bad influences are the peolpe who had a to much opportunities and they don't care.

Be influence for other people ""it depent's"" what's type of of friends did you have, and how you're parents educate you. Because friends can make you to get trouble at school or at home with parents that the bad influynces make it you. For example people with bad behavior tech you bad things in differents aspect and that people are not you're friends. But is that a life you can have nice friends, people who had a bad influence too, people who are a very good influences for you.

Giving people better influences can help you in your future, basically in everything. For example you can have a Social life, Friendly smile, Nice peronality, Kind and all of the others specialityes. A lot of people had a bad bahavior at school they influid their friends too. The problem is the major of students sometimes they have a bad life a lot of problems at home. That's why their bahavior is like that. Some of the parent""s does not care about their Son's or daugther's how is the behavior at school or anywhere. Because they are awesome kind of persons or parents can't get the control of them.

However, they are true friends who love you, help you to had a normal behavior some of youre're friends not all of them. some of the friends when they saw it that you in trouble they don't talk to you anymore. For example in my own persoanlity i never, ever get suspension or problems from the school. So that is what's fake friends do theyprefer to lose a comunication, but for some reasons are good because it people who are not a nice person with you, bad influence. So that are the reasons why cause not all of your friends be there for your when you need someone can be for you; True friends and good influeces be there anytime that you need help or talk to them that's why you had to select your friends. You have to know who are your real friends and who are not.

For instances, People can have a opportnity to had a better life, future is the kind of people who had a bad behavior. It the type of people who influid the better influence for bad honestly sometimes is sad when you see that.

But, anyways nothing can do about it because a lot of people try to help them. They don'n wanna put their part for be a better person, influenece for give new perspective. So people get tired to help and they continue in the same way. These are all of the reason's why some people had a bad behavior some don't.                "
1319,653620381DB3,"Do you think that high schoool should only be 3 years instead of 4 years. well some might say it would be better having 3 year's of school other then 4 year's. but the way to achieve it is difficult.

I think that school should be only 3 years. beacause some student don't really want to be in school for too long. this can give student's a goal so that they don't have to stay for 4 years. it would give the students a higher chance to focus in school and then head out to college for those who are interested.

I belive that if student's can find a goal of having to be going for 3 years in school instead of 4 year's. it would take them hard work and confident in order to earn it but other's might say that they perfer to be in school longer. because of friend's or liking to learn alot and it no rush toward them for they are interted in learning.

but in the future I hope that evey student can find a way to be seccessful in there time in school."
1934,91B88A23A5E4,"Dear principal,

you are considering of changing school policy so that we the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have at least a grade B average. while many of us have a grade C, i know you are trying to make us bring our grades up by doing this but understand that we like doing sports and activities especially our favorites but you can't do that because it sounds like threat to us. you can do something else but not stopping us from sports and activities without making at least a B, please cancel this policy because we really need sports and activities to keep our body focus and healthy and we also promise to keep the good grades and do our homework's, and try our best to keep up the A' s and B 's.

P. s please don't forget we love sports and activities because we the students really have fun with it.

2367,AFC600D922F6,"I agree because being yourself is very hard sometimes and feel a lonely. Today is in the world nobody like to be all by themselves but some people like to be themselves. If you being yourself you can able to do more work because nothing else to do and feel like board so let study something, work hard. How about your fun time go out with someone, you can't be work hard all the time because that is not a good experience. So I do sometime fun myself and be yourself It's doesn't means you can do any a good stuff. You can do something what is make you feel a happy all your life. don't feel strange yourself and being strong.

1336,66F03584BCA5,"Should people make their own decision, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters ? Some people value self reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves,I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. Their advice help me make better decisions. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I thing It' is important to ask for their guidance in these matters.

Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life. My teacher have worked hard with me to provide me with guidance and the skills I need to be smart in life.

Thatswhy,

I think people should ask for help and guidance from their parents and teacher before making important life decisions. Both my parents and my teachers know my strengths and weaknesses and can help me in making the best decisions."
1267,61445D1ABF16,"One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career.

First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever I'm taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because it's really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling.

Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. It's very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how it's like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life.

Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and I'm mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and it's a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since I've drew so much in my life.

I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life. It could be very hard sometimes but it is still fun to do."
3079,DAE1AA29184B,"Should Generic_School extended school day's by two hours for four day's a week? My opinion about this is we shouldn't let this happen for many reasons for example; Students would be waking up late,People got jobs after school and responsivbles after school, Students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. Having to go to school for four days would be great and all but I would rather go to school for that extra day then just four days for ten hours. Other people would agree with me and my reason why we shouldn't let this happen. I'll give you more detail reasons about why we shouldn't let this happen.

My first reason, Students would be waking up late to school, It's very important to go to school and people waking up late could cause a lot of problems with the government and with parents. The student attendance would drop a lot, Students would be waking up later on in the day, And would be missing a lot of class work in the moring that could be important. That they would have to make up which could be hard because they would have to stay after for school if we would have ten hours of school and it would be hard to do it in class. If we didn't have two hours added to are day then it would be much easier to stay after school, And students would be waking up on time and going to school more often.

Next reason,Some students have jobs after school and responsivbles. If we would have ten hours of school it would be impossibe to take care of those thing. Having a job is important some students could be going through tuff times like family issues,Some students even have kids to take care .Some students got a lot to handle that and school work and going to school. Other students they got other thing to do for example vist people family members,having chores to do around the house.

Now,My last reason would be students wouldn't have time to do homework and actives after school. There are alot of students who stay after for help with there homework, Clubs and sports,some students enjoying staying after and practicing to join the soccer team,foorball team etc. Students even have time to work on there homework when they get out of school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldn't have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers don't want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer. These actives could affect students class work, How tired the students get and sore when they come back from school.

In conclusion, We shouldn't add two more hours to the school day for four days a week it could affect students attendents and how they act with others,People have jobs and responsivbles after school and students actives and homework. That's why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. Student's come to school on time and prepare to learn. They do want they have to do after school and everyone is happy with that,Others will be unhappy if we would add two more hours to are day."
399,1E2B10DC7A53,"In my opinion, they shouldn't let students attend class from home. Students do not attend their classes will most likely to slack off. Although it is a great idea, only the truthful will attend classes from home while the other student will be in school. Students need to be in school to social and get out of their house, students shouldn't be in their bed listening to the teacher and being lazy all day. Student needs to be in school.

From my point of view, students should be in school to socialist and need some fresh air. If a student stay home then they'll feel lonely, decrease their social skills, and be lazy. Due to this, students can develop some type of mental health problems if they stay in their house for a while, also some student who is in home will most likely skip school just to enjoy their day off. Teachers should know their students more. If a teacher knows who wants to learn then they'll most likely will focus on that student but if the student doesn't care then the teacher will try their best to help the student. Therefore all K-12 students should be in school and learn.

Even though you understand my argument however, I think the trustworthy students should attend class at home. If a student shows respect and work really hard, then they would most likely to attend class at home if necessary. Although it is best if they attend in class but if they are sick then they are welcome to attend class in home as long they listen to the teacher and take notes. But if they are really sick or any emergency, than they should email the teacher to let them know. Students should always let the teacher know when they are not in school and ask the teacher's permission to do a video conference.

Without a doubt, students should be in school to socialist and need of fresh air, I do believe that everyone will be good in class and show respect to any adults. All student needs to be healthy in a physical and mental way. Students need to be in school in order to build their social skills because that's part of life, to socialist people if they need some assists or you need some assists as well. However, if there's a trustworthy student who work really hard may attend class in home. But if a student is awfully sick and in crisis then he or she will email the teacher that they are not in school and ask if they can do the work next class or in the morning and lunch break. Whether or not I think all K-12 student should go to school and learn instead learning it from home.                "

Also they can spend more time with their family.

Those who believe that adoption of a midnight weekday curfew for teeagers will be important have their reassons.

It will be unfaily interfer in young people's lives.

Also it breaking the laws because teenagers have freedom to do wethever they want but not bad things for example, don't do drugs or other things.

Others people think that adoption of a 10 P.M weekday curfew for teenager will be important they have their reassons too. For example, it will keep teenagers out of troubles.

One of the reason you should hire me, is I was in varcity swim team at school before so I know how to team work with co-workers, and I could use team work for team for customer servise also, like if I brought wrong order for a customer, I apologize first and bring right order with some extra cutomer servise. Second, I al ways help my mom and do chores for her. Clean living room, kitchen, basement, bathroom, and other rooms. That helps me when customer is complaining about like a table is dirty, or floor is mess, I can go there quickly and clean them fast as I could and go back to my job. Also, my hobby is to playing games. But I limited the time when to stop so I do not over-play and control myself to keep playing and stay up till midnight.

First reason will be the journy. The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody.

As the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow."" You have to still keep on mastering new things in order for you to grow more. Those are my three reasons why i agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. "

Although Thomas Jefferson believes that is always better be doing something that doing nothing, because if you do not try to do things in life you will never get a purpose, actually Thomas Jefferson says that if inactivity also serve a purpose, in my opinion people do not like to do things because they do not want to be someone in life and they are lazy.

Although Thomas Jefferson says if inactivity also serve a purpose in life, in my opinion, when you do not do anything you will never get a result of good things always we have to try to do some effort to be someone in life.

In addition, According to the prompt and ""determine never to be a idle"". I have never been idle in life, because i always do my responsibilities and i try to not be lazy, some times i also help other peoples cause we need to be good with others no matters how they are with us.

1912,9000217714BE,"To. Principal,

My opinion about this change is a good idea. But also many students have a grade of a (C) or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students. For others this policy my be a good idea because that way students that love sport's can start doing much better in school and have better grades. A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.

Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

Instead we should vote to see if we like this policy or not so we wont have to pass thru all this stuff of the policy changing. A fact about students here in SCHOOL_NAME would choose not to accept this new school policy because the old policy is u can't have more than three (F) and i would say the old policy is better than the new one our principal want to change it to. So if i pick my own decision it would be no changing policy and its good as it is and the policy they should really change is having to no wear uniform to school because its such a distraction to me an much others.

1387,6B20E9C115AF,"I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. But there around you are person who can influence you to be a bad attitude peson with others. The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them.

Everyone need to be respected don't matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans. Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them

However, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... . I feel that recieving a bad attitude from a person that you even know is the badest thing that someone can do to you becuase you don't know that person and if you show that reaction from you that means that you're like that with everyone and show that you dont have respect to others. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you don't know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that you're successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them.

Considerating that don't matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that you're always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you. However knowing that you don feel well and you gave the best of you to others before, that will be a great acomplishment for you and from now on you will be and example and will help othres that feel the same as you to continue and leave that bad mood behing and show the best of them.

In conclusion a good attitude is one of the important things to success in life. I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didn't like how that person is. Doesn't matter what you can't act bad with other persons, even if you don't know them and think that you will not see them again but the reality is that in other day you can really need from that person but that person will not be there for you because of how you acted before.

1280,622ECD91DA0C,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. For example, once I had a friend that talked really bad about a girl and I believed everything he said, but when I started talking to her, she was completely different from what this one friend had told me about her.

In conclusion, people are not always what they seem to be and you can't judge them on how they look. I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. That's why I think that you can change first impressions."

All people need to have time for care about the family and be responsable for their child.

Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours.

I desagree because if we have two more hours we can not have hours for study and make the thing that we want."

775,3BFECA0F8470,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives? My opinion is negative for people's lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. If we are in the house, we didn't do any communicate with family. We will get sick. I believe technology is bad for our life. And technology will hurt many people.

First of all, Technology had negative effects on people's lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. Since, I was in Generic_City, I forgot my phone to bring outside. And I was doing nothing that day. I thought I have to focus my life without technology. We can do many things without technology. For example, we can do shopping with friends, we can play board game with people, and we can do talking each others. I believe technology making me more dumb. Also, technology will be my life controller.

Second reason is if we are in the house, we didn't do any communicate with family. When I was in my house our family did not talking and they are doing their own work. I was so sad about this. My mom just watch TV, my dad did a slept, and my sister did play the phone game. At that time I want a talk to my family but they was very busy. I miss my time to talk about my school life with my family. Also we did not know about each family members favorite and what you don't like. So When my birthday party, my family members don't know what I want to get.

want a say, "" You have to do communicate with your family as much as you can."" It will be help your whole life.

Last is we will get sick. For example, your eyes get hurt. Because if you watch video a lot, you will get blind. So you can not see anymore. Your health is very important in your life. Too much technology will dangerous in your life. I love game, but I delete my all games because when I was young, I started the game, but I get sick more and more. I thought ""If I am doing game more I will be die."" So I was delete all my games. Also, You will be overweight.

Because your not moving and you ate a lot, you will be fat. I worry about that. Don't kill yourself.

In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. But my opinion is this will be negative for people's lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. If we are in the house, we didn't do any communicate with family. We will get sick. I think you can do technology. But not that much. Please plan your time and use it. It will be help you. This century is technology century. But use it safe. I believe you can do it. I will try too. "
1140,58567312BDAB,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attent classes from home because: students would not have a social communication with their classmates, students would not ask questions to the teacher for help when they need it, and students would not participate in class activies or projects.

Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there is not a way to meet new friends. For example, in the school students would know different types of people, races,and cultures. Also, students would know each other, share special moments, and have a friendship. Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused or they have some question but they can not ask to the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, it is hard for them to ask about it because there is not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or if they are doing a homework and they get confused, it would be hard for them to finish it because they do not know if they are doing right or wrong their homework. Thirdly, students would not be able to participate in class activities or projects because they are taking classes by themselves at home. For example, in the school, students can work in groups projects, expositions, and activies. Moreover, when students work in groups, they can learn how other students work, the tecniques that they use and skill that they have.

In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students live far away of the school and they do not have transportation. Also, some students have jobs and other responsablities.

In conclusion, some students would not benefit from taking classes online from home becasue, they would not have a social communication, they would not ask question os ask for help, and they would not participate in class activies."
2577,BF5E7CD37E4B,""" Imagination is more important than knowledge ""

Can imagination be more important than knowledge?

I think that imagination can be more important than knowledge. Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie ""Return to the future 2"" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor.

First of all, whiteout imagination the world couldn't be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world.

Also, the imagination can help people work. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments.

Third, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him ""i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day"", he told me he was better.

Finally, I think and many people does is that whit out imagination we couldn live happy and whit a lot of fun, knowledge is a part of the bast world of imagination. People famous and normal people are successful by the imagination they use in theres life."
2866,D001F6D3A0D0,"Everybody would like to be succesful in the life, and that's possible, but is not easy you have to try one time and one more time until you have what you want; it doesn't matter how many times you try for it. In my opinion there are a lot of people that if they fail one time they give up and shouldn't be like that because you will be happy if you complete your goal, you will be a good example to help others to be successful, you can earn more than you expected.

Complete your goal can be really important for you, and will make you happy, for example, my Mom wanted to have a beauty salon, but she knew that it wouldn't be easy; she started with a small room and a few customers, sometimes she didn't have custumers, and that made her think to close the beaty salon, but she never gave up, now she has a big room with a lot of customers; she is happy because she is doing what she likes, and the most important part she never give up. That' is why we have to try many times until we are happy for what we have or what we are doing.

Some people would like to have an example to make their goals, and you can be a good example if you don,t give up at firts time that you fail, for example, I have a cousin, Generic_Name, she was a bad student; she didn't care about her grades, tests, homeworks, and nothing about the schools. when I moved to live with her, she saw my grades and all that things that I do. She stared to ask me how I can have good grades in the tests and be successful, and I said to her,"" you need to have more enthusiasm for the school"" ,and now she has a really good grades and she is going to graduate this year. If we don't stop even if we fail, we can hel others to be successful.

Some people might say that you lost the time trying something many times, however, you can earn more than you expect if you try as much as you can, for example, I saw a video on facebook; there was a man that was loking for a job to support his family; he went to many places, but nobody gave him a job. One time he was walking on the street, and he saw a man trying to fix his car, and without thinking he went to help the other man after that the man was thankful for the help, and he offered a job for the man. The man who was without job; he didn't know that he will get a job on that situation, what would happend if the man would be sleeping in his house; he would never get that job. That is why we never have to lose the enthusiasm to be successful; we never know what is prepared for us.

It is clear that you will feel good if you complete your goals, and you will be a good example of persistence to help others to be successful, you will earn more than you expect if don't give up at the first time that you fail, and maybe is not easy, but you have your whole life to make it happen, and nobody will tell you when to stop; it doesn't matter how many times you try or you fail. The most important part is that you will be successful if you are constant and and what you are doing. "
1236,5F998012DDCD,"The argument related to distance learning has often been a topic of interest to many people. Nowadays, many scholars support the idea of distance learning and it has been getting a great acceptance among many societies. Although some people think distance learning make students careless in doing their work, nevertheless, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it saves the time they would spend by going to school and makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage.

To begin, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it saves the time they would spend by going to school. For example, it can take ten to forty minutes for a student to go to school. This shows that going to school takes students' precious time and makes them unproductive. Clearly, no one wants to waste his/her time on transportation.

Furthermore, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage. For instance, students who spend their time on technological materials know more how to accomplish technology related tasks in a short period of time compared to students with no experience. This proves that taking online classes prepare students for higher education and learning. Obviously, the use of technology is growing fast in this age.

Overall, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This is because distance learning saves the time they would spend by going to school and makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage. In conclusion, schools have to offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home."
3818,FC2D44D20533,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four- day work week, with each day coasting of ten hours. l feel is better conserve energy because help your resources and has a good businesses. But the same time is better because have more opportunity, with the money you help your family and others people with the person that no has money or houses.

Firstly. for the people is difficult working four day in the week because no accustomed a job strong. Sometime person he like a job strong and pay good, and to buy more money for that her children study and has better life and good future and can has a carrier. Some people do easy working everyday and working ten hours, Many people no has a good life but they struggle for that her sons has food , clothing and other things although even working large for give better, some parents no has energy for working more and the children have that has a job for helped.

Secondly. Some parents no has more energy for working. Some sons are bad with her parents because, when they are young abandoned and no help an her parents leave lonely. Many teenagers grind that parents no can give good things or no can buy clothing the mark or shoes Nike. They only want give one opportunity for that have a good future and a job better.

Thirdly. Some people working strong for give better an her children. But no all time is good pleasure an teenagers some young help an her parents but others, no and no are grateful that, How struggle parents for that they have better and can study, and one day to be better person and good son. We stay in the school and complaining because come to school, and own parents that working everyday though day that they no can more and no have energy but they so follow present in her work.

In conclusion. I believe that many parents want the better for her sons a lot time that people no appreciate her effort that do the parents many teenagers in day now lacking the respect. When they are old man they to be tired and is more difficult working and more so is job strong. Also they working for have a good business , and for they is more difficult that her bodies adopted an job that working every day and does ten hours all day.

1581,78E692CD7085,"Students should have to commit career at a young age bacuse they can trust what their are doing. Studrents can reach their goals.

Students who commit to a career at a young age always doing better things in them life, and when students get a old age he or her always know what they have to do because they trust their work when they was young.

Ex: Generic_Name said, when she was a young, she was trust her things and it was always teaching her many thing and shows her what to do and how to be, and many people was care about her, they was not doing them things without her, when they want to do their things, they was waiting her because she was help them and teaching their, and she get an achievement in her life, and reach her goal.

Students having to commit to a career at a young age to get an achiever in future, they doing what their trust, and they always doing what they know because they believe that whatever they trust puting them in a good way to reach them goals.

Ex: Generic_Name said,When she was young, to commit to a career was the best thing that put her in the best way, and believe her thing, when she belive her things, always she was in a good way and it always protect her life, and many people get to respect her, because there are people who was not having an respect to her, and it's shows her what kind of something she have to do that can give her the way to reach her goal.

Coulcaim:Many people said, Students should not having to commit to a career at a young age because it's not important in their life,it cannot help them anything at all.

Therefore: to commit to a career can teaching students nothing in their life, they cannot trust or believe them work or what they are doing.

Coclusion: To commit to a career in life makes students to understand many things, and if students trust them things they can get good safe in their life, they can teach others and protect their life, and students having to trust them things in lives, students cannot lives without trust what they are doing and reach their goals."

If you are working with a group you can get more frends they can get more friends by talking to them. Second by doing things for them like helping them with their homework. You also ge more friends by making them laugh and giving them things.

I know it is hard getting to know people more getting to know people can be hard because some people are shy like me. It might take them a while to met new poeple. Some people just do not like talking because they can be really shy and get nervous their hands can get really sweaty.

I chose working wih a group because the benefis can help out a lot of people like me that are really shy and onse I get to know them I won't get shy as much like I use to be. Finally people are fun to hang out with like my English teacher Generic_Name she is a really good teacher and makes everyone smile and laugh.

263,130CA439835B,"I think is good idea, because the students have more opportunity to graduate early. some school districts offer programs the allow school, student to graduate in three years. most students follow this plan, must take courses during the summers,or in the evenings or may not be able to take electives course. but if you finish,

the school in three year you need to study very hard to pass all the class.

is good to finish the school early too because you go to the college early and you have more time find a good job. but you need bring more focus in one class but not in other because the graduation, can be going down. but they need break too because most students going to sleep during the class because they study in the night i would like to thank all, the teachers give homework and they not finish because they, dont have time to complete. what can they do during the night they need to get energy, to continue study for the class.

some students are very smart but other students work during the night and they dont have time to do the homework because they came tire for the work, and they dont focus in the class and they no pay attention to the class because some students came from other countries they need to pay house need get foot, clothes and other thing to school but, they need to learn English first because they need to pass all the class for enter in the college,

and they can get good jab to save the money for the future ,they can buy his own house, and get a family they need more important thing the education is very important because they look good person no body say bad thing of he.

I think is good idea because you focus only in one thing. then you can study , just in the school but if you trying to graduate for bettor life if you graduate your parents be happy. because you comply your goals if you have a dream follow you can comply, but you need to focus in the school dont slept during the class, did the homework get good grade dont forget you need to graduate in three years. must students who follow this plan must take courses during the break. to study for the exam you need to be ready for the college, thinking about you life what do you do when you out the school, you getting good job they dont know, yet because we are in the college ,but they have a dream to follow in the college the most important is you get good grade to graduate because if you get good grade they know you are good students.

my opinion is if `you graduate early you have more opportunities to grow up. very first because you are ready for the new life, you can find good opportunities,

but you need to focus in one goals first because you can get good opportunities, away because you graduate for the college ,and school o ready. they families will be happy for his becuase he get good result in the college.                                "

Other thing that you can do is when your see your granma talk about the problem she have and what was the solution she took for that problem and why because when you expiriens the same problem you now what you can't do or see do options you have but is important that you ask before appends to you or someone else that you now is important to you.

You can't do so much if you ask before it appens to you or your family because if happen you now how to confront the problem for your self or whit the people u carres for you and loves you that are some options you can't do to comfront the type of problem you expiriens.

You can't help others if you don't stay in silence and ask if you can't help or do something for the person u is expiriens some problems and what type of problem because some problems cut always be dead.

Experts can show you how valuable its our life and how much we have to appreciate it. We as teenagers are not suficient mature to take a wise decision and mostly we as teenagers take the wrong path for not being wise enough or not having knowledge about how to take an important decision for our life without noticing how damage are our bad decision for us, and how much we can hurt ourself by not knowing how to handle it. Our decisions hurt people we love even though you don't want to hurt them because we let our impulse control us, and because of those decisions we hurt ourself and we hurt others by not realiazing that we push back our family and friends. Your decisions makes you grow as a person, but also make you find yourself, your decision are the ones that makes you be who will you be in the future, so you decide who you are gonna be.

981,4B0F6070B45A,"Every day all the people in the world make a lot decisions and each one have different way to decided. Sometimes you have you have to ask for help, becasue there is a lot of people with experienced for example, parents,teachers and experts. I think decisions can affect your future and also can affect other people. Adults, specially old people have a lot advices for you to be a better person.

First of all, decisions are the key of the one person and can affect the future for the rest of the life. For example,education is one of the most important thing in the life, and that's why your parents always keep saying go to school, and finish the high school that advice is given to you because they want to see a better future for you and you have to listen because is the experienced that is talk is not your parents.

Second, adults have a lot of experience specially old people (grandmother and grandparent).For example, every time when your parents talk for your future, they know about the life because all they have experienced and maybe when they were young, make a bad decisions and that's why the given to you a lot advices because they worried about you.

Finally, most of the time specially (young girls and boys) when they decided something always is wrong because they only care they self but that decisions can affect other people. For expample I from Generic_City and in my country all the time you see young people make the decision to drop out of school and get to the gangs. As a result, they get to the jail or they died and the only people who cry is your family bacuse they want all the best for you.

In conclusion make decisions is not easy for each one because some are easily and some are hard, but I think you shoot ask all the time first for help with your parents and with experts because they have a lot experienced.        "
3475,ED9C6EDC5601,"Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes.

First of all I don't think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers don't even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time.

Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they won't be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughing stock.

Adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. There would be more trouble then there is now and students wouldn't get motivated. Grade levels would go down and students won't focus. Teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours. Family time would be shortened as well."

This is why I want to visit France and what I want to see and do when if I visit France."
1386,6ACB38C6577C,"Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them.

A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they'll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired.

In conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person."
3772,FA2DE7E82907,"It's has been saying people learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish a goal. Keep those mistakes out make them less likely to build self-esteem. True self-esteem come from achievement because is better point the mistakes in order to success.

Point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the SAT exam ; he decide to practice math problems .His math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. I could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam.

Lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. Like in my sophomore year I had a English teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite I felt like I was going backward instead of forward. I found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for.

Student learn for their mistakes it's much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. Eventually student that don't show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because it's better clear the doubt. Like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. It would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. Praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn.

while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and it's better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesn't mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem."
2263,A975CBC4A7E8,"Great opportunities for students to attend to classes from home by online way,

Well, Now a day with the new technology. Thinks get easy every day, Long time ago you had to attend to a regular school because there was no other way to attend to school and accomplish your career dream, But now we have new technologies that allow some school to give online classes from home, If you live far away from school and theres no way you can get to school faster and easily. You don't have to worry at all, Because now there are a lot of online web site that can give you an opportunities to you to accomplish your goal or your professional career, so I think this is a great opportunity for all of those people who never went to school and think is too late, Well is not, Online classes allow to accomplish their goals to every one, No matter what age if they are old or young they can do it whenever they want, And at the time they are available,

However, Some parents decided to enroll their children in a online school, Because they think thats better then to sent they to a regular school, In one point those parent are right because in a regular school you are not looking out their children, And they dont know what they are doing, Or even if they are in school or not, And also you dont know what class of friend does your child is hanging out with, Or if other children are bulling to your children,

In regular school you don't know whats going on,

But. by the other head in home school you can be with them during that time they dedicate to study, or even better if your schedule don't fit with the time they need to study, you can hire someone you have confidence with, To help you, In home school your child is not surround of bad children that can make your child feel depressed, So in this way you can see how your child is going in progress,

And I think this is one of the best decision you can take to enroll your child in a online school, Or even your self if you want to get your education higher, I think this is a big opportunity not just for child but for adults too, This schools online bright us a lot of benefices, For example those people who didn't finished their studies is not too late to continued, This benefices them because they can do it at the time they are available, And in a comfortable place, In my position I'd rather enroll in myself in online classes. Then to come every day to regular school,       "
553,2A60299D5D14,"I agree with honesty because it can end so many problems. So they don't have to build up and cause a lot of damage. Another reason why i agree is that you don't have to lie even more to cover what you already lied about. And it its hard to catch up with Ur lying it can also get confusing and you can get caught lying to there face. The last thing is if you get caught lying it can cause more problems with the person and can lead to more issues. It can also help the other person to trust you. If the person trust you you dont have to lie to them so it wont hurt there feeling. Also you can lose someone trust or lose the realashinship you have with them. It can also hurt a lot of other people that u care about. lying can cause you to look bad in front of people. And id it hurts there feeling you can solve them because you told the truth.

Also it can help you to stop lying and get better at telling the truth so everyone can trust you. and thats the reason why i think honesty id the best policy "
2482,B8656754E9EB,"Do you believe failure could lead up to a better person? Shortly, I am going to discuss as to why making mistakes is necessary for a person to become a better human being. When a person makes mistake he's/she's is more likely to learn from its mistake. However, not all person learn from their mistakes in the first time, some take longer than others. Therefore, you should always look back at what you did wrong and always fix your mistakes. Making right decisions should help you become a better human being for its future community, country, and even the world.

I personally strongly agree with Churchill's statement. A person should not always be right, some people think that by doing what pleases them they are doing good. However, little do they know they're hurting people because they decide whats good for them and whats not good for them. That leads up to a person who is selfish, mean, and has a cold heart. Mistakes are a problem, and problems can always be fixed.

Once upon a time my friend Generic_Name had a girlfriend, Generic_Name. He was a good kid with a good heart, therefore, that led to people takeover him easily. Generic_Name's girlfriend or friend would always takeover Generic_Name. She would tell him what to do and how to do it, she was the man in the relationship. Thats how good my friend's heart was. She knew she could trust Generic_Name because Generic_Name loved her like he never loved anyone else. Till the day came, sooner than what we expected. The day that he will never forget. It was a Thursday and Me and my friend Generic_Name were on our way to work, I was driving when all of the sudden he starts screaming like if he was having some sort of a seizure. "" NO how could you do this to me"" he said. ""What happened?"" I asked. He tells me that he was on snap chat just chatting and looking at snaps when all of the sudden he sees his ""girlfriend' kissing another man. I tell him to relax and to let it go that she was not worth his time. He calms down, breaks up with her and moves on. Years passed, I noticed that he has changed. He is not the sweet boy with the good heart anymore. He now learned from the mistake he did, which was to let his girlfriend controlled him. He now knows when to say NO and when to say YES. People make mistakes all of the time in their lives. However, that does not mean you cannot change it or fix the mistake you did.

Mistakes are mistakes. You cannot go back in time, but you can move on and make a change in your life. In conclusion, a better person makes a better future for its world. People can change,and we all make mistakes. However, we shall learn for the better.

In Conclusion, I would like to give an advice to all people to never give up. You made a mistake? You all shall learn from it. Fix it. Make of yourself a better self being and be and example for all others. We are not perfect, but we could try or at least act like we can be. Learn from what you did wrong an improve yourself. Love everyone because you only live once in this life."
1869,8CD4C142DCEF,"Why should you accomplish anything in your live? In another words, why should you finish anything in your live? You need to accomplishment to get your purpose. When you done something in your life you will be successful, not boring, and proud of yourself. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that, we have to accomplish in our life because when we will accomplish in our life we will get our goal, however, people might disagree with me, and they think that inactivity serve a purpose and that's not true.

It's a great thing to be successful in your live. "" Don't work hard but work smart"". In another words, you have to keep yourself working all the time. When you success in anything you feel comfortable. For example, In our school you have to do your work so you can success. when you let yourself finish the work you will be successful. Let yourself to be accomplishment in anything and you will be successful for ever.

When you keep yourself busy, you will never get board in your life. Being active all the time is healthy. Keep yourself working out, study, driving, eating, so you don't get board of your life. Always do anything to until you accomplished and do not leave it until you finished. For example, I go play soccer so I wouldn't get board in my life. If you don't want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world. Do not get lazy anytime because if you got idle you will not be an accomplish person in live.

Everyone will be proud of you when you accomplish something. You will be proud of yourself too that you accomplished something in your life. Always work hard so you can get a good grade and you will be proud of yourself. For example, I worked hard last year in World history and Geography and I passed the SOL, my dad and my mom both of them were proud of me and the whole family were proud of me, so you have to being working all the time.

In my opinion people accomplish when they always doing something . Always do your work and finished so you can success. Always work hard and keep yourself busy so you couldn't get boring. I know that some people will degree with me, but that's okay because everyone have different opinions, and my opinion was if you didn't work hard you will not get what you want. Let yourself work hard, so you can accomplish you work and success in your life. The best thing in life that you done work and proud of your work. Always accomplish your work and get it done so you can be a successful person.        "
896,44E2726DA1B3,"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college.

one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport.

Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.

Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.

In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret . Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships."
1564,77D5466305CB,"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person.

Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didn't know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know.

People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldn't learn english and that I wouldn't have friends, but then I thought ""If I don't start practicing or trying to learn I won't be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldn't understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadn't try.

My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didn't know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesn't know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doens't mean that's all she can do.

Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didn't know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesn't mean you can't do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doens't mean it didn't work, it mean something went bad and you don't need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want. "
1341,674F5DA988D2,"The city is debating doing a curfew of 10 P.M. week day, and a midnigth weekend curfew,

this a good council because if the city do curfew all teenager can be safe and they can have resposabilidad with dont breaking the law, with a curfew the city can try to keep safe all citizen and the young people can keep out of troubles.

My first reason why is important to try to make a curfew in the city is because in the nigth is too dangerous for the citizen and especially is more dangerous for young people,if we have a curfew we can keep all citizen and the most important the teenagers safe.

My second reason is because the parents do not have to worry about the teenagers because if the city do a curfew, we can keep the teenager out of troubles, and the parents can feelling good because everybody wiil be in home safe.

My third reason is because if the city do curfew we can keep the teenagers out of drugs and alcholismo, because the young people is the first coustomer of drugs, if we have a curfew we can take away of the jail at a lot teenagers. A curfew can keep safe at all teenager and all citizen.

My conclusion is do a curfew is a good opcion to keep all the teenager out of troubles, if the city council do curfew can being safe all the citizen."
2294,AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who don't have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school 's should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible,

second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success.

In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you don't fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and don't waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that don't know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you don't depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own.

In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats.

In conclusion

I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

3758,F9C298BF7CE5,"I agree with this prompt that positive attitude is the key to success because, with positive attitude it gets a person where they want to be in life. However with negative attitude you will never get anywhere at all, it will make a person lose confident, also would make you give up right there on the spot which means you gave up your a quitter. Then soon turn into a really bad habit that can't be stopped. Attitude is very important, and the way you use it can really affect the success that your trying to reach and to others ,its also very easy to just lose it all in less than a heart beat. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect.

How can positive attitude motivate you to do good? well ya see when your having that energy that makes you believe you can do anything, or that anything is possible that's motivation for you to keep trying and embracing that positively well make a person stand out. By doing that it makes a person feel good about themselfs and motivates us to keeping that same energy. This is why it's important just by your attitude can have a huge impact on your success and how you use it is very important. By motivating your self, and others themselves will be motivated which is a really good thing. It's like your helping others out one of the first things to do to become successful , to help each other out and having a lot of patients is all in that positive attuide. This plays many key roles in the real world and will make a huge difference as well. An example, walking in for an interview being positive at all costs and respectful shows signs that your interested therefore you would have a possibility of getting hired and can go from there you will be a very successful person. I know everyone is successful in there own ways but there are limits and attitude plays a huge role in that.

spreading positively to others is another important topic because these people might not be doing so well but you can always help change that for a person. By boosting their confident to make them happy comes from positive attuide because in life, theres no time to be playing games there's very little time to accomplish your success before it's over and soon to be regretted. Also in encouraging others will make you extremely happy that right there will get you somewhere in the future and it will be good. most jobs in this life style today sometimes go based of skills and etc. But Mostly look into a great positive attitude, there are a lot of benefits to this in reality being skillful and useful. When something doesn't go as planned, keep trying bring that positive attitude forward never give up it's not too late to change. Taking a test and having it being extremely hard when given negative attuide you will fail and face the consequences but doing the opposite you would be much more relaxed,and will boost that confident up into keep trying because life is full of mistakes you have to push and keep trying now that's what being successful is almost about. Albert enstin did he give up? No right? and look at where hes at he became one of the most successful person ever same with Bill Gates and Mark Zurkrbuirg when you keep going you will see the results so keep pushing and one day I guarantee you will be a great role model or even better. Just remember always keep that positive attuide and keep trying think about the good and not bad and you will have the key to success.

learning from your mistakes is another key attuide to have, people have to understand that when you learn its OK to fail and get back up from it thats why you learn from them for a reason. Having positive attitude in life helps you grow as person to understand, and in the long run it will important. When doing so, you will just keep growing,and having good support from yourself or others. think about businesses to be in a business its all about that positive attuide and character that's what makes you learn from your mistakes and to keep growing. In a business there's a lot of up's and down's with negative attuide it will only make it worst but when your in the right state of mind there are choices to make that you might not like but it is part of life,in a business you need to support one another.

In conclusion having a positive attitude is the key success in life, without it how will you know what you've accomplished along the way. There are many ways to have a key to success but the most important one is having positive attitude. And this will benefit your life even more,attitude is energy and showing off the wrong kind of energy will be consequences and will not get anyone anywhere in life. This is very important for each an other it's not very hard to be positive you just have to be in the right state of mind. This shows how much attitude can really change things it shows how important this is. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect.

299,16005A45A20A,"There's 90% of people in the world that wants to be someone in life, but some people never had the chance or some people just gave up on school,and now they regret it. In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that that's not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we don't do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if it's really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in.

I want to be able to see if the career I want to take it's really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldn't just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasn't really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldn't do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever there's a problem with my mom's car or my dad's car, we go to him. This is what I'm talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I don't want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me.

If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career I'm interested in. It does not only help me to see if It's really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didn't know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, I'm attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because I've heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because that's what he is, but I told him that wasn't really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldn't be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since he's the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friend's house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me.

There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so I'll just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you don't like the job you are doing everyday, then you won't ever be happy with what you are doing. That's why you have to find a job that's really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people that's going to need your help. This is why it's important to know what you really want for yourself.

I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision. Like I said before, if It's not what I want, then that's okay because I've learned new things that will always help me in life. If it's not for me, then there's always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know there's more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. It's not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out. I want an opportunity to see what I really want.                                                                                                           "
1754,84CE7281265F,"My uncle has in his wallet 100 dollars, he give to me 10 and stay with the rest,I tell him to save the money for tomorrow he well need it, but he spend all the money to buy shirt pants and hats, and the next day he was asking for money for the gas for the car. My unclewas happy for the money and to buy things with the money and fro not listen we was need it for tomorrow. He spend all the money in things that are good for him but he knowing he will need it, for tomorrow he spended it, are all.

Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choise. Once of my friend was having money on his paket he says,""lets go whatch a movie on the cinema"". but all the rest of my friend we tell him to ""NO"", Because the movie was aready in CD and was much less money than go whatch it in the cinema. When my friend recibe ours opinions we see the situation in other perspective of the he was thinking. Even my friend want to whatch the movie on the cinema, should be a to spend a lot of money to pay. and that how we tell him to buy it.

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. My Dad give to be money to buy anything that i want, knowing that tomorrow I will need a white shirt, I buy a game and my dad tell me about the place that we need to go and will need the shirt and for my obsession for the game the nezt day was asking if they can give me money to buy the shirt, and my dad tell me yesterday,""I tell you to buy it, but you don't listen to me"". Even I was knowing about the shirt, this happen because i did't listen, In adition, all the talk and learning, and that day after the money I save it for this type of case.

The case that happen in resume, all talk about how important is that to listen to the people around you, All this situation happens because there were listen to the person next to it.

and you, In sometimes is okay to that more than one person talk to you?"
195,0EC7D67618F4,"Although some say students should use cell phone in classroom because, they used for internate acsses to do in class works actually, students shouldn't use cell phone in classroom because they are trouble in the class room and they are doing chat when the teacher is teaching.

First, students shouldn't use cell phone in classroom because, they are trouble in the class room. That mean when the teacher is teaching the students may be listing music so that makes trouble the other students, They didn't do any thing for classwork. They only doing listing music and watch a movie so on that happen it's very disturb. Also, If the student want listen music and teacher never want to listen music so that make fight with teacher. In the class room students usually don't use cell phone so one students use every time cellphone in class he/she always trouble in class maybe that happen again and again in class the school decide and rejected him/her for didn't come to school.

Socond, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, they are doing chat when the teacher is teaching For example, When the teacher is teach on the classroom and students doing on the chat there is no attention what the teacher says. Their is no attenition to learn. Their is only play with their friends in the class .Their is show a bad image with their friends. It mean one student want to joke for other student girls or boys so he gonna show for that person bad and rude picture then student lough in bad situation. Also, the one students lough for him picture his/her moral is not good so they don't want to come again school by confidently. He/ She is scared and afraid.

Third, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, they are cheating on the test. For example, If the teacher gave for students a test and he sat down in the chair then one students have a cellphone he/she can cheat on their phone so they got a good grade for that test that makes bad for the other students score. It means students they dont have confidence do their own test. Every time they don't want to study for test and they always think doing cheat on the test but that is bad for his/her kownleage.

Fourth, students shouldn't have a cellphone in classroom because, there is no any particpate and activites when the teacher ask question for students. Their is more time waste and spend their time with their cell phone all the days. There is bad for health because when every time watch movie and listen music that is no good for brain and eyes. It means every time stay with their phone and the brain control one thing just the movie or the music so we can't handle or participate other thing even didnt look the people what their saying.

In conclusion, students shouldn't use cell phone in classroom because they are trouble in the class room and they are doing chat when the teacher is teaching."

First reason, for saying the the tecnology have good effects on the human's life is it helps to do many activity fast and easy. For example, many years ago we had to go the store and we watched the stuffed we need. now with the new technology, we do not need to move. we can bay only.

Second reason, tecnology gives support to the knowledge with the creation of new tools and more precision.

For example, before we used the telescopes for treated to understand the universo, now the technology us helps with the creation of new satellite .

Thrid reason, that support the tnechnology have good effects in our economy. For example on market every people want to down the price of production, the new technology helps on this.

5,004AC288D833,"Dear Principal,

Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.

Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!

Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.

some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.

so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
3029,D8FCB1AB9867,"Student should commit to a career at young age they will save more money, and they will independet at young age also they can work and study at the same time when they get out from High School it would to be more easier that career they want to take and you have that help of the teachers during freshman year until you finish high school. When you want to become someone on this life you got to do whatever you have to do no matter if you need to work and study at the sametime. But if you want a good career you need to start at young age some people leave their family right after they finish High school. However for people who was independet during high school they already know how life is and it would be more easier to to leave their family,sometimes parents they don't allow you to live in another state or country because they say that you are the only daughter or son but what i said you got to do whatever you got to do to do someone on this life. For example some parents are immingrant on this country and they did not have the opportunity that you have now so,they need to undesrtand that you want to make them pround and let you be who you want to be on this life.

Also you always have the support of the teachers during High school they will always going to push you foward it would make your future more easy because they will give you choices of that career that you want to take and help you on your classes if you are not passing a class they will give you homework to get your grades up at the end of the year you ready to the next step. School is your second home becuase school will take you to your goal, teachers are you support if you don't have support from your family, but you got support from your good friends,and teacher. Otherwise if you don't have support from your family do never stop looking for your goals because than they will be proud of you,sometimes family give you their back when you most need a support from your own blood,but sometimes you don't have any support from them and makes you sad,depresed. But at end of the day you have your teacher that they will never let you make you stop from who you want to be. That's why is a good idea to to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

In conclusion,age doesn't matter to make a dream,there's many reasons to stop your goals but do never let anything or any person stop your goal but you always going to have a support of your teacher and family,sometime you might not have any support but never stop doing what you want to be because at the end of the day you will be proud of yourself."

2692,C66B4F537548,"I Believe people who have positive attitude's towards life, are one of the biggest keys to success in life. You will see your life in a different perspective, than people with negative attitudes. They doubt them selfs threw life and never reach there goal's because they dont have a positive attitude. You'll never give up easily or at all, because you see that it will help by making you fill more accumplished with yourself by having a positive attitude.

Having a positive attitude will also make you a good person. You'll show yourself and others how to change there attitude towards life. As you are accumplishing your own goal's in life, you could be helping others do the same. So by helping people out with the way you see your life, you could help others reach the same goal on positive attitude with there lives. life its self, is the biggest challenge anyone can go threw. Where put threw challenges everyday with out even knowing, and get threw them no matter how hard it may be. By helping others it could make' not just you seced in life but others as well.

Even my family and I have been threw the worse. From living in room's, basement's, and being envicted from apartment's because my parents would'nt make enough money to keep us in one place. They were losing alot of hope with life and from ever being stable for there family, but me as the only boy in the family I had to keep my positive attitude in life for our family goal in reaching stablebility for my older and younger sibling and I. I would wake up on top of some folded blankets the hard wooden floor with my mom and dad aside me but I would'nt care cause as long as I knew my little siblings were on the bed comfortbly sleeping it would make me feel good because I knew one day it was all going to change.

Keeping my positive attitude with my life really helped me alot, because once I turned 16. I started to work at Mcdonald's everday after school from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for five days a week. Everytime I got payed I would save up my checks because I knew my parents never had good cars. We would always buy junky cars off the road, because we could never afford new cars. So I set my self a goal on buying my parents a new car, because I knew it could help them out. By not spending on old cars, I also knew they could never save up from all the stuff they had to pay and such. There were many days at work where I wanted to quit, but I would always look on how my family and I lived. Also on how much my parents struggled just to give us hot food on the table. So I always kept my positive attitude with me for my family.

The day came after 1 year of working I had saved up over 10k for a new car for my parents and the family. My mom and my dad where so proud of me and told me they could never thank me enough for all the hard work I had put in everyday at work for the family. Me and my family started to gain hope on our family after they saw what a big change I had made to the family just by having a positive attitude. So my two oldest sister's and I where starting to save up for a home for the family and that too, we had accomplished. Now we have a home that we have been living in for 5 years now, everyone has there room I bought my self a car too. Life is good and I feel super successful with my life already. So yes, I do believe having a positive attitude is the key to a successful life. "

, Should or should not the student commit a career at a young age ?

Reason 1:

I think student should to select a career when they enter a high school with a young age.

EX : Some sudent want to learn more about what different career they can choice.

Reason 2 :

The student can identifty a career in a young age to be prepared and know more about the career that they select .

EX: If the student select a career the they have to know if they like or not because the career that select is something that they have to put a lot atencion and preparation .

Reason 3 :

Take a career in a young age can be good for the student because can learn more about the career and finish it when they don't have a lot responsabilities .

The student that wanted to take a career with 16 or 17 old age , in the future can be beneficial for him and her family because they don't spend her young time with other thing like vice of the negative people in the society.

EX:

The student that take and finish her career can have a lot oportunities en her life.

1692,80C2ED8BE6A6,"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of student's struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff you're interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home.

I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so it's more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When student's get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if you're sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop you'll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades.

However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eye's. Also that it's easier to cheat on test's and quiz's in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosen't know what your doing on.

That is my reasoning on why taking online classes is more beneficial then going to school.  "

"
3532,F05D3802BC94,"Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time.

Initially, cellphones would draw too much of student's attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn't happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online.

Secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they've learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn't really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop.

However, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time.

The student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because he'd rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Cellular devices draw too much of teenager's attention and can also encourage cheating. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help."
2876,D06EDF336392,"A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble.

In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. Because sometime we have a parent suffering from high blood pressure and don't know where their children are can affect them. In this case, parents are the main piece of the education of children. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. If this case, parents can have a few control into the life of their children. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. Because we have a french proverb what said ""Tell me who do you walking with and I will tell you who are you?"" And the best people for approve your friend and answers us the fabulous question ""Who are you?"" Is our parents.

Furthermore, this law would reduce work of 911. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. Because we never know what can happen in a teenagers party, they can do a prank call challenge, they can have a fire in party, or they can fight. In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. We do not know who the people who walk in our street and their mentality. We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable.

In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. that can help teenager to study. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. To have a fantastic performance in everything we doing, we need to have our eight hours of sleeping that is also the case of school. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. In this case, teenagers can learn to be organize and responsible. Because the curfew can sharpen their sense of priority what is actually to back home before 10 P.M. And this sense of priority can help them to be a wonderful adult.

Finally,to sum up the situation, we saying our vision about the beneficial effect of the curfew in our marvelous city. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe. The curfew can assure the best future for the children in our city and

3143,DDC3C4A828DA,"It has been said that first imperssions are almost impossible to change, do you agree or disagree? In my past experience, I would highly disagree with this statement. When first meeting somebody, you don't always get the right thoughts about that specific person. Once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking ""What should I think about this person?"". Due to my past experience I always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not very kind. After, they're opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind I am. My friends were very suprised.

Second, I would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said.

Second impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones.

Third,

I would like to speak on my past experiences with this statement on why I disagree with this reasoning. When I was a couple years younger I had some very means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of very mean people. Due to those sayings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. People thought they already know me through thick and thin but in reality they really didn't. Once, I wanted to meet new people they never actually really wanted to speak to me or actually meet me because they already had there first impression because of the sayings. Later on, years started passing by and a few people started meeting me more and started speaking to me and once they did they noticed that I was very different person then what people would say about me.

In Conclusion, In my past experience I would highly think in my beliefs I would defiendely not based my first impression on somebody I'm just meeting. I like to get treated on how I treat others. First impressions are never good that's why it's never good to get based off that. You've read my about my past and now know why I don't go off that. If you ever decided to go off first imperssions and not change your mind about your first impression then good luck to you."
799,3E156DCB07C7,"We accomplish more when we are always doing something not when we are being inactive. There are many people out there who are most of the time through out their day are being idle and never doing anything, they're always sitting around and won't do what's the best for them by trying to at least accomplish something in there daily life. Although some say being idle does not serve a purpose, actually being idle does serve a purpose, rather you should go out and accomplish something better for yourself.

You might say being idle is not the good for you, but being inactive can sometimes be the best for you. Thomas Jefferson said that ""Determine never to be idle."" Thomas Jefferson doesn't realize that the reason being idle can sometimes be good is because you might not notice this, but in your daily life you can be doing to much for yourself to the point where you won't even realize how much you have accomplished. Once in a while you should think to yourself what you have done and accomplished during the week or day, it makes you think that you may need to be idle and put some time away from things that you usually be doing. What myself believes in is that you aren't always going to be doing so much for yourself in your daily life on what you want to accomplish in. Sometimes you need to put it all away for a short amount of time and give yourself a break and just be idle for once not for such a long period of time, but make time to do your own things. One thing that is true about being idle is that it serves a purpose for being inactive, but the reason why that is good because you can always go accomplish it another time and you can come up with thoughts or ideas, for later on when you want to accomplish it.

However, in my thoughts always being idle isn't good for you because you may have time to be idle, but you don't have all the time in the world to be idle. It would then just keep you away from doing things that you want to accomplish on, Which will then make your mind not want you to do things in anymore. In my perspective what myself believes in is that being idle for to long is such an impact on your life because when you take your time away from the things that you usually are always doing and have a daily schedule for it makes you forget what you had going on and what you were trying to accomplish in. Thomas Jefferson said that ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Which is true because you can get so much done if you are always doing, and it is wonderful like Thomas Jefferson said. You're doing a lot of work and accomplishing it all by succeeding in the things that you need to get done, and it's an amazing thing to do because you rather do it now then doing it at another time and put so much stress to yourself. In my opinion, accomplishing it at the right time is better than accomplishing it at a different time. To explain what my opinion said is, do it at the right time when you have the chance to do it rather than doing it at a different moment of the day. It will makes things much better for you because it's better to get things over with now. You would't want to worry about it later on it would then just make things much more of a problem.

Additionally, in my thoughts being idle keeps you away from doing the things you want to get done, it makes an impact on yourself on what you're trying to get done and it can distract you from your work. Something that is true is when you're are being idle, it keeps your focus on staying in the moment that are in which is doing nothing. An example of being idle is staying in bed all day on your phone. Why would somebody want to be doing that when you can be out accomplishing your goal and succeeding on what you want to become in life. Thomas Jefferson also stated that ""Determine never to be idle"" if you were to never be idle you can accomplish so much and keep on doing what you always do. People shouldn't let themselves get distracted by being inactive, they should take an advantage of all that and think rather than being idle they can be out accomplishing there goal and reaching for somewhere better. In my opinion, people should do more to get to where they want to be in their life because if people are doing that then you're definitely accomplishing something better for yourself.

In conclusion, although some say idle does serve a purpose and should be accomplishing their goal rather than being idle. In my conclusion people shouldn't be idle because it will easily distract them from doing better things and accomplishing their goal, and it wouldn't be great for everyone. Once in a while people would get inactive way to much and just forget about what they have to do or accomplish in. Many believe being idle is good for you, but it can lead to a bad habit of you always being inactive and no want to achieve in your goal. In my statement idle does serve a major purpose in peoples daily life and can just keep them away from doing what they do. Some say people should accomplish more on always doing something and shouldn't get inactive."

2476,B83897288B43,"As human beings, our character traits are important in our lives, because they are what determine who we are, and how we are going to develop with the people around us. But those traits, do we really aquire them ? Or they are formed by little and dieferent pieces of things that trough the our lives they influeced us ? In this essay I will argue my point of view and why do I think.

Our parents, they were our firts teachers, and also the firts influence on us. I'm lucky for having really good parents, but not just becuse how they treated me, but also for what they teached me; being respectful, responsible, having manners, the good things. Those are traits that not everybody have, but the ones who do, it's because they acquired that influence from somebdy. When we are growing some other factors influed on us, I remember that in my firts group of friends everything we did was play with those Hotwheels cars and everything I wanted during my five trough nine years old were Hotwheels cars, it was in my personality the fact that I liked them, but if it wasn't for those ads on TV, those external influnces I wouldn't realize that I liked them, same with LEGOS when I was twelve, and videogames nowdays, and during that time and even now, those friendships became another influence on our lives, we play or talk about same things and when we are doing that they become a influence for me on the same way I become a influence for them.

We share and receive those little traits for outside and we forge them into a unique trait by mixing them with ours, making it part of our personality. Someone who says the opposite may have their point, because in this world there is a lot of people who came from the worst places, when you could see the worst influences for then. becoming an admiable and respetable person, but then were you listen their story, it was something, even a little influence, but for them was bigger than any other, even the ones that were in front of that people, so they wanted to reach it and they did it. People is really suseptible, specially kids, so lets try to keep those bad influnces on them, because as the same way a great person can come from a bad place, a bad person can also come from a rich place just because they were under some bad influence, teach them good things so they can avoid the bad ones. "
713,36BBFBB5EA41,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life; I agree with this statement about the importance of having a positive attitude. In life you live and learn lessons, dealing with stress after stress, or learning that every struggle you faced at the end it will pay off.

The key to success in life is having a positive attitude: never envy what others have, nor wish bad upon a person for their success. Trust the process, life will knock you down, get you at your lowest but having that positive attitude towards every struggle and having that positive mindset to others will get you further than you think, having that negative attitude towards everything wont get you far in life: hatred, jealousy, and hard headed wont take you nowhere: in life you are going to face the fact that not everything will go right, and not everything is going to be how you want it.

This statement about having a positive attitude is the key to success in life is true, nothing will get you far if you have a negative attitude towards everything that comes your way. If something didnt work out there's always a reason why it didnt went how you expected it, either you decide to work harder to get where you want to get or just give up and not do anything to get you closer where you want to be.

I agree with this statement, no matter how hard it gets having that positive attitude towards your losses, other peoples successes, and working extra hard will get you further. The key in life is to have a positive attitude."
2962,D464E294DDB4,"Our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. For example family has a very huge impact on who you become as A person because you are with them every day. Another big impact on our life is the community we grow up in.

We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them.

We can't choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become.

Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

In conclusion the person we become is built by influences beyond our control and we can not just change when we want to.          "
1370,696B864AED8C,"Most of the people thinks that having a positive attitude is the key to success. It has been said that a good attitude is the best way to reach the goals. I totally agree that is important to have a positive attitude to success in life.

Having a good attitude can helps people to get a job. For example, if there is two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are.

Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Other wise, if a person show a bad attitude and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didn't gave him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had teach you to respect the people.

A nicely attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demostrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you desmostrete the techer how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life.

Other people thing that is not important to have a good attidute to succes in life. Because, sometime you can be in a bad moon and attitude is something that you can't control. So, attidute is something is simething that can you hold.

In conclucion, having a positive attitude can help you reach your goals because a good attitude demostrete personality, education, and how careful you are with other people. Having a positive attitude can tell how your parents grothw you up and how you really care to learn a high education.    "
361,1B981E7E59C5,"some people believe that students will be required to take a music,drama,or an art class.

The students required of many classes to accomplish their knowledge, but some people think that students need to take a music, drama,or an art class because:

I think that students will need those classes to graduate. To get school diploma students will have to accomplish some classes like music,drama,or an art class. they should use those classes for distraction their mind to the other classes for examples math, history and science class then, they will get relaxation. Also, I think that some people wants the students take those classes because those classes represent happiness, peace and an individual talent that every person have. but some people get frustrated that they don not have any talent like sing, act or draw. Some people want that the students take those classes because they need to develop their mind in something productive for the society and for them. No think in bad things or bad actions.

Also,I think that some people think that students should be take a music,drama,or art class because students have the potential to protrude in the great music,drama and art world. To prove to the society the capacity that they may have and that they are the future. They will replace the people that do music drama and art in our present for example artists,painters and others.

I think that some people believe that students should be take music,drama and art classes because is the only way to develop their mind,knowledge and to learn new things that help them for the future. Those classes help the students to get a mental and physical develop because the music make us to express feelings,emotions,or give to the audience a message that we want that they know and understand. The drama help us to develop our mind,but also,help us to use our body to express something that we want that people will know. The art class help us to represent,express and get abilities that students will do not know that they have. With those classes students will be exactly what they are and feel because they will express anything that they may want without get frustrated.

In conclusion some people believes that students should be take music,drama,an art class because they need new persons that express and give to them that knowledge that represent those classes because those students that will learn are the future and are the new generation. Also, because students need express feelings,emotions and develop their knowledge. Because they think that the students are interesting in others things that is not productive and they need to learn those important topic to not be loss and continue with the music, drama and art in our world.

Today Mr. can help me to learn more to help others, to help who needs. It's necessary start to think in the future doctors, start to pass the learning to the next generation, the theories, and the grow of the modern medicine.

This partnership can teach me what the doctor learn all this years. The learn of the doctors can help me to learn why the things are doing this way, for example em de patient stop to breathe the doctor has to put a tub to the patient start to breathe; and if this don't work the doctor has to do a mini-surgery. The reason why when some one brake a leg the time of the recuperation is different; the reason why when a car chars happen the patient has to went to a T.C. The reason why cancer happen, if it is in our DNA or can happen with anyone.

This partnership can help me to learn the theories. The theories of the causes for the repenting blinding, or way some patients wake up to the coma and other don't. How will be possible in the future faith with the cancer and the autism to help the people that have it; how its possible someone o broke the cervical walk again. If it's possible create a substitute to the glasses, what will be the percentage of people who have obesity in the future.

779,3C693CBFEFB5,"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation They're in right now.

Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts i've watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk.

One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""

because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer.

Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others.

Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.

Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again.

The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others. "
2193,A39660CA003E,"Imagine that you like photography but they required you to get music, art, and drama instead of photography they will be upset. Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because it's their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes.

If you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they won't do any classes that are forced them to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you won't pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. Say one student who doesn't like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. If they say it's required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if it's for whole year I will choose they aren't required.

I think they aren't required to take those classes, because those classes aren't meant for them. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesn't need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they won't do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesn't like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective aren't mandatory to take. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class.

In conclusion that, if they choose it's required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take. So I think that those classes aren't required to take unless they want to take.                                                                                                     "
1101,54AC60510DC3,"Dear Districts School:

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to require that students can finish high school in three years. I am in favor of this proposal for two reasons.

One reason I am in favor that students can finish high school in three years is because some students they don't be able to take elective class and they don't have to waste their time to take another class. Most students can have more time to think and choose what career they want to continue to study. Since, they would like to go to the college and finish their career and get better job in their future.

Another reason I am in favor of this offer is because students can have their opportunity to start to work more and save their money to continue to study. However, some students they don't have family or helper that can help to them to continue to study. Although, students need to work hard to graduate more early, but they have to keep this opportunity that this programs offer for them.

Therefore, because this programs offer opportunity for students that want to finish their high school more early and if they want to continue to study they can take their time to work. I am agree with this proposal of this programs that students can finish their high school in three years. Thank you for taking my support.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name    "

Company that going to select one person to visit and show how they works. Since I was six years old I was secured that the Assets was going to be my job.

That's why this opportunity is so important for me. My whole life dreaming and wishing about be in a company and now my dreams comes true.

I've have been learning a lot by myself about the business and assets my whole life.

351,1A469EB86263,"We can always accomplish if we have a time and also if we try to do more than do anything. Accomplish don't have to be all the time just when you can. For me to do accomplish more is better than don't do inactivity. I have 3 reason why I think do more accomplish. First reason is, to be better. Second reason is, do more. Third reason is, feelings. There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they don't have to much time.

First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We don't wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We don't have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we don't have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I don't have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing.

Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we don't have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time

Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good. When I know is good

I say ""yes I finishing"" and I feel so proud of me. when we do something we have to be positive for every will be okay.

In conclusion, to do accomplish will be the best idea for to better extra work. The reason why the accomplish is the idea is, to be better, to do more, and the last one is feeling. what Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we always doing""

that is most be true for all kind of people around the world. do more is always help and always do accomplish is the best idea.         "
3333,E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.                 "
2914,D250DB9080E0,"I agree with this prompt about the first impression, based on my own experience and for what I've seen in myself is related or better said similar on my every day life, and what I really mean by that is: First impression that we show it won't change that easy as many people expect to change between one month to a year, not because we couldn't change it but because this is who we are, also because this is how we act and it won't change because is part of ourselves.

In addition to this prompt i think it might be impossible to change our first impression not because we can't change it, but it'll be because is part of our personalities, in my case should I say is part of how I really am, how my culture distinguish me, that's what makes me unic and by trying to change a part of me it would make me feel empty, because first impression means a lot to me and is all thanks to my past experiences that I've been through.

In conclusion to this paragraph i think that first impression is important, it helps you to understand how a person is, also it helps you to analyze that one person, and most of all i think it helps a lot when you're patient when trying to understand others at the first time, sometimes or most of the time people would judge others by their first impression without seeing what's really their intention, this is what I think about it, we shouldn't judge just by the first time you meet someone even if you think that person is an stranger, just give them a change to prove you're wrong with their actions and their way to treat people, thank you."
3144,DDCB2CC96EA7,"I am strongly agree the failures in our lifes means to keep going and be a successful person. Although some say success not consists of going from failure because people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes, actually success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes and get experiences to teach other people.

Those who believe success not consists of going from failure have they reasons. One reason people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes. But doing the same mistakes many times does not help people to be successful; makes the person wake in front of others. People that are better to them can make bullying at them because they feel that they are perfect than others .Many of the people that keep thinking that they are a loser think about diying is the better thing to get out of the failures. Did you know is that 90% 0f the teenagers kill them self instated of find help to keep going with their lifes. It is very scary and make me sad at the same time. If we use social medias we can see people talking about their lifes or using drugs and drugs makes the person to lose more their mind.

However, success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes. Learning from failure to failure is better for all the people. Having the enthusiasm in our mind can be the better word to start our life every day. We are capable of doing many things it does not matter how many times we have to do the same things to be better in our feature but we have to keep going not matter what. In my position I have a experience; when I was in my country I did not what to do with my life; I just was trying to finish my middle school, get a job and then have a family and now here I am making better things for my life; now I am tinking about to have a better life. when I came to USA I was tinking about how am I going to do if I do not nothing about the language but now I feel more conformist knowing the language because makes me keep going studying. I though that learning another language was a new obstacle for me to keep going we my life.

Also, success consists of going from failure because people get experiences to teach people. There are many people that think that they are failure and they are not; I think that every people are genius. The things is that people don not let the talents get out and that can be because they think about others people opinions about them. I have many experiences keep seeing people about failure. Had you ever try to help others? I have it done many times. When I was in my country I saw this person trying to be better but at the same time this person was with many problems that did not let to keep going. In many occasion I help the person to be better like getting solutions with the problems and it is very difficul to teach others with the problems and try to make them better.

Seeing our life in a failure can be the worst thing, but keeping trying to do better things each day is going to be the better effort in our life and that is going to help us to get more enthusiastic every day. It is very helpful to find ways to be better in the world because every person had to have new things to do the life better for themselves and help others if they are struggling with their life.

57,0484BCFC725D,"Do you think fail is good? in this paper i will argue failure and success in life. Some people get sad when they fail something, they try to not loss the enthusiasm, sometimes people get mad by them self.

First, people get sad when they fail something, because they try the best so they can get everything right as they doe, and maybe they never image that they gonna fail, and sometimes some persons cry because they fail.

Second, some people try to not loss the enthusiasm when they fail at the first time, because maybe they have a good positive and they said that the next time they do not going to fail, so its mean that they not loss the enthusiasm at the first time they fail.

Last one, person get mad by his or her self, cause they think they don't do well, and they get really mad when they fail for a little error they have, but that get that they are learning because the errors that person have made them learn.

Some people said that failure is a bad idea for success. but some people don't loss the enthusiasm as they been falling and that made the person won for those who said that failure is a bad a idea because the person that don't loss the enthusiasm is keep going until they make sure to not fail anymore, and as they been falling they been learning.

In conclusion, for some people failure is a bad idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
3620,F44AE6192EA9,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond What you already mastered, you will never grow.""

I agree with author Ralph Waldo Emerson because base on each experience of every people that they had mastered, i think that what you already mastered in life it can make you be more stronger base on the experience that you had.

I agree with the quote because unless you try to something you need to have pasion and focused in things that you can grow in life over things that you already mastered. You can grow beyond and over things that you already master and learn new things to keep growing not just staying in the same spot.

Experince new things in life are going to make you feel more stronger and make you think that you can do things that you maybe never thought about that you were going to do beyond what you already mastered.

Unless that you need to reach and make new goals to grow you need to make an efort no matter how hard it can be for you, you need to focus in that goals that you want to grow more and have more experience just for keep practecing.

Base on my experiences, i could do something beyond what i already mastered because i want to learn new things and try to make good things and that's going to make me grow more and experiences new things that i never thought that i can do. To grow exterior and interion i need to be confident with my self and letting me know thing that i can do better thing that i already mastered and be more suscescfull.

I agree with author Emerson's statement because of what he wrote it make me feel confident with me and keep trying beyond what i already know and already master you need to push your thought to make your goals come true.

686,34C829F3DC6A,"Going to parks can be exiting for people because they get to have fun by playing tag, hide and seek, or maybe look at insects. I like going to parks because i get to ride my BMX bike around with my friends. some adults go to parks to exercise, others like kids get to play and have fun by swinging or playing on the slides.

Some kids go outside in front of their house and play other games like hopscotch, jump rope, or like other people they can do other activities outside and ride bikes around or go to a skate park. there are endless amounts of activities for people to do outside, playing on the swings at the park can be fun because when i go there i like to see who can go the highest and sometimes i just do it for fun when im bored

People that like to find and inspect bugs can go at the park, the park has lots of bugs including butterflies, ladybugs, caterpillar, and fireflies. some people find bugs interesting for some reason. theres also a park called a dog park. but you would normally see kids having fun, Other people at the park like to play tag, tag is a very fun game and i think that kids would have fun playing it, hide and seek is also an option. theres no point of going to the park if you can't have any fun. My favorite thing to do at the park is play on the swings, when i get bored i start to ride my BMX bike around my neighborhood. Spending time outdoors is good for you. The park has a lot of things you can explore there,but playing is my favorite.

There can also be some animals at the park like birds and ducks, there is also a place called a dog park where dogs go to play and have fun, dogs need fun too! at the dog park you can teach your dog tricks there or just let him/her have fun, maybe even let them meet new dogs! but in my opinion a normal playground is better. Taking your dog for a walk is an activity you can do outside but you can do anything outside or in a park as long as you have FUN."
2523,BB5D6C14712D,"I agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because, the more the try the more experiance they will get, they will get more power, they can cortrol people, and they will get freedom and respect.

Most of people are scared of losing or failing. They think failure is the end of the carrer. For example most people when they fail in business they give up, or some people don't try things because they are scared of the unknown.

One of my mintor alwasy telling me the more you try the more experiance you will get. For example i tried many types of business and i failed on some of them like i tried to do real estate i brought a house and i lost $50,000 because i didn't know how much the house worth. Also i tried Bitcoins and because i joined late i lose $7,000. But i never said i'll quit, what i did is i got a mintor his name is Generic_Name, he is doing real estate and i leanred a lot of things from him and one of my friends is good on bitcoins so i asked him to teach me and he became my mintor.

After you get the experiance you will get power and what i mean by that is it will be hard to fail. For example Bill Gates is a powerful man in business do you think he will be in debt? the answer is no it will never happend because if he lost everything he made other people will help him to success again and everybody want to work with him.

Then, you have to have a control because you don't want other people to tell you what to do. for example who has the cotrol in the hosptal? the doctors or who has the control on companys? the ceos. The reson why they have the control is they are more succesful, or more educated, or they are powerful. Another exapmle if someone has a company he will have the most cotrol because he'll be the most powerful person in the company.

The last thing you will get is the freedom and respect. As a business man what i mean by freedom is you can go where ever you want when ever you want, and what i mean by getting recpect from people are two ways the first one is when you are more educated than them and when you make more money than them.

At the end success is like the marathone, you don't want to be the first preson who get it but you want to enjoy it. "
725,3814F9116CD1,"Well the business that I want to visit is about hospital or pharmacy,and now I will try to convince to get the permission the manager of the business.

Hello sr , how are you? I hope that you are good , the reason why I am writing this letter is because I want to tell you or ask you or get the permission of you , if I can visit your business? Well I have some reason ,why I want to visit your business :

First I wanna visit your business because

I am interest and I wanna learn more of your business, because I want to work or have a career in my High School , probabily may you ask why I am so interesting of your business , but the answer is this is because one day I was at my hause playing soccer with my friends, and after we done to play, my mom call me that was a mergency at my sister hause, so I drived so fast that I can , when I was there , my sister had a heart attack , so we took her to the hospital , so after the thirty minute was nobody there who can attend us and the more time that we was spanding more bad was my sister , so I was so angry with the hospital service, so we didn't want to continue weating in the same hospital , so we went to another hospital that people said that is good hospital , but real was that there was the same thing , so my question was where are the doctors? why nobody attend us? my sister is almost die after 30 minutes a doctor came to us to attend my sister , now my sister is good she has no problems with her heart , but when the doctor done to attend us , I asked him a question , I said why all the hospitals take to long for attend the people?

and he said It's becuase we don't have many medicament to attend all people who enter sick or with serious problems also he said we don't have a good suply for attend the people who came very sick or almost dieing, also we don't have many doctors in here, that why we are slow to attend the people.

well I was thinking about all people who die because in many hospital don't attend them, but sometime the people don't see the problems that happenning in the hospitals ,also many doctors don't get a pay , but they still working because they see the needs the people have.

well I thought that may be I can be a doctor who save life and help people who need it , that is why I am interest in this business or job.

Second reason why I wanna convince you to let me visit your business it's because I wanna be a doctor, and learn how talk to sick people , and see what things you use to emergency , also I want to have a good aventure , also I wanna meat people to make new friends , my second point is a little be friendly , because in your business you have to make friends to help or you can help them, like sometime we don't know something how do it , and may be your partner know how do it, that I am trying to explaim is that if make friends in job or business is to work problems that you don't know together, but if I make friends in the business it's to work , not for play during the work..

Third reason I want to convince you is that many people or students wanna explore certian occupations , I select this one because I wanna learn about your business, how they work ? what type the rules is in your business, and how much you pay , what days we have free, all the normal things that we know that I have to learn , and also I want to know, how many days we work by week? .

Fourth reason that I want to convince you maneger is that your business is the best one and I wanna learn everything of your business and know more everyday and , you know what? when I was little my mom asked me that what I wanna be when I have more age or what are my dreams , everyday my mom asked me the same questions and I said I wanna be doctor the person who save life who help people and my mom told that if I put all the me , also I tell you a short story , One day when I had five years old , I was in the school , and some bad people that they only like to play around and make people angry , one day I was studying and one of those kids started to annoying me and teld me bad words , but he told me one thing that I never I will forget is that he told me that never I will have my dreams in my life, that I will looking for but never will be real, and I started to think about it and I was like sad because I thought that if that he told is real, if I never find my dream, what will happen with me ? what will be my life? and one day I was thinking in room I said I never give up , I will fight for my dreams , and nobody teld me what to do , I just will follow my heart for everything , the point of this short story is that never give up if have a dream looking for ,don't let people who make you feel bad , don't listen negative people , just do it wherever you want to be or what want you that the people says when you die or something like that...

fiveth reason that I want to convince you that let me visit your business, is that many people have the chance to explore or visit a business but some people just don't care or they try but , if they can't make real , they give up or they just move to another job or another dreams, but it's not how many time you go down , if no how many you get up, for example: I want to visit you business because that interest me and that why I am writing this and give you many examples of me and another people is because I want to learn if you give me the permission, I think that if let me visit your business, I will have more interest and I will have more emotion to be a doctor that is the work that interest and I will be honest with you all this that I wrote is for have your permission for I can visit your business and can know things that I want to know or see things that I never see before , also I want to tell you that , if you give me the opporttunity to visit your business , and hope that you can let me visit your business if is like that , thank you for take a little of your time to read this , I hope that you have a great day."
935,4758405809B3,"Is it hard to be yourself on a world that is trying to make you something else?, think about it?, we live on this world, trying to be like everyone else, instead of just being yourself and live happy. In this paper i will argue of how the world is trying to change us day by day, how we get influence by it and end up changing, and how every year that goes by our generation gets worst and worst.

The world is everyday is trying to find a way to make us change, we as humans have stop, and think, what we want for our future? why would i want to be like everyone else? Do i want to be a wealthy person in this society? Do i want to accomplish all my goals?, those are the types of question that we should ask our self, and think deeply, were will we end up on the future following the steps of the rest of the world?, because in this world, if you want successful, you have to be yourself, the world is not going to do it for you.

We get very influence by world, on activities, the way we talk, the way that we dress, the clothes that we use, our religion, and a lot of stuff that if we dont like, or we dont do, we are not cool for the world. A good example is the clothes that we use, if we dont us the clothes and shoes that are trending or popular right now we are not cool for the society, and maybe the reason why we dont use it because, you dont have money, or you dont have time or access to buy or simply you just dont like it, and for the world that means your not cool or cute, because, you dont us a certain clothes, and is shouldnt be like that, because, some people get bully by that and some even get to a depression because they cant afford any of that and is very sad to know that this world is like this.

Sadly, by every year that goes by, our generation get worst and worst, and the reason of that is the world. The world has influence us, in such a bad way that is sad, all the new drugs that are killing people, the war between countries, the new artist that are coming out that just sing about drugs, killing people and sex is of a very bad influence for our generation and sadly if we dont start being our own selves, and start the right stuff, eventually we are going to end up really bad.

some people say that this world is bad, and just gives us bad influence, but they are not right, because is not neccesarly the world, it could be us, letting ourselves get involved or influence in bad stuff,and then say that is the world fault, when is really your fault, for getting involved on bad stuff overall, in the future, i hope that this world changes, because we still have time to do it and is not impossible, i just hope that this generation that is coming up, have the courage to change the world and make it a good friendly world."
2803,CCC05B237877,"Your attitude is the best way to achieve your goals or just a plus to get everything easily. In life if your attitude is pleasant you will have a lot of opportunities, and also be succesful in work, love, and friends. For example if you help your partners in work, and do your work well probable your boss prometed you in a better stand for all your effort and devotion. Another example can be in love if you are affectionate, charismatic, and loving probably you gonna find someone love you and give you the same love, and actitud you have with her.

To begin with, the best way to get a best position in your work is to show a good attitude. The majority of contrators like someone everyone loves too, because is more effective to everyone and effective for the company. For example last year in my uncle work someone will be ascent, 3 workers inclued my uncle, the most part vote for him because they said is the most friendly, and the most appropiate for the jod. To conclude this if your attitude like the others everyone wiil be agree with you and they going to follow you because they trust you.

Secondly, the best manner to be in love with your partner is havening a great attitude, and communication. The most part of relationship work, because both respect each other, and have a great communication. For example my Mom and my Dad never fighting they prefer talk and solve them problems and teach me how is not necessary have a load attitude to solve a problem. This show how have a good attitude is the best way to prevent the love gone and preven divorces.

Some people say, is not always neccesary have a good actitud to be succesful in life. A lot porcent of people think have a bad attitude is a caracteristic to be succesful and is not a obstacle to have a great career in the future. For example the president of my country his attitude is disagreeable but he has a faultless career and although he is likeable is the president of El Salvador. However everyday people say ''he is the president because we need him no because we want he lider us''. This demostrate how you can have a good career or power, but if your attitude is unpleasant although they need it never gonna like you.

People with good personality and good attitude have the benefit to get everything more easy for how you expresed to others. And people who have a weird attitude no matter what they said if they sttil have that attitude and don't chance people never gonna try have a friendship with them for this reasons. In conclusion be a person charismatic a great friendship with the most part of the people your life will be benefit and different just to have a good attitude. "
211,0FD73E4EED03,"People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters because the people that wants make their own decisions they could not to know anything, just they are following their instincts and ideas so that mean they will believe that what they are doing is correct when it does not and it is against the rules.

Laws; the consumption of drugs and alcohol, to carry of guns, and to drive; the consumption of drugs is unlawful in too many states and you need a permission that you can buy it and the alcohol is legal but you need to be 21 years old or more to buy it, to carry of guns; is legal but is same to drugs and alcohol you need a permission to buy one and be older, and to drive to get a license need to be 16 or older that its up to you, but if you decided to get your license when you are 16 years old, you have to drive with someone also as copilot; the copilot need be more older than you, you need to do this because they want be sure you have the experience to drive alone.

Work; when you have a job you have rules that you need to follow as a schedule, duties; you have a specific schedule that tell you when you have to come to the work and when you have go to home this help to your job keep everything organize to the employers because if the employers come to the work whenever they want to, can this affect the company, like if you are an accountant and the company needs you in the morning but how you make your own decision to do not go in the morning you go in the afternoon, so as you skip your specific schedule the company have a problem with the accounts and its your fault for not follow the schedule, duties well you have specific duties for you by your skills, so that mean you can not make a decision do something also because you can be fire.

Society; well you do not have the decision to do every thing you want outside, like you can not to burn a library because you had the idea brilliant to do it, you can not kick or hit to everyone to see outside just because you have a idea make laugh your friends, and you can not into a private property to get a flower that you see and liked , you can not make that decision in your life

In conclusion, we can not let the people make their own decisions, I am not saying that people can not have rights to do or be something, I am saying that people can not do everything they want, they need guidance from experts and authorities to help them more to the minors they do not have the conscience to know what is right or no."

My teammates was in a bad attitudes try to cheer them up and I said ''at least we went though to the semi finals it was quite hard for us.'' Then my teammate was quite happy because going to the the finals is hard. That my experience how good attitude changed my teamates in diffcult times.

We have great time even if it was raining long time ago we have good attitude in diffcult time. For me good attitude in diffcult time feels like heaven only if you do it right, but bad attitude in dfficult time is the devil. This is why good attitude in difficult time will be the best and help you succed in life.    "

It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them.

One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society.

Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it. For example, schools can provide vital information about the career students may select, depending on the course they like. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals.

In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age.

In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career."
3480,EDE0A58B0B47,"Who wants to work alone when you have a chance to work with a group like common! Working in a group is so much beneficial because within a group your able to get your work done quicker and efficient. ""who doesn't want that? I know I do"". With a group you can also interact and descuse with your peers about your work and get feed back.

Weather or not you agree or disagree with this position. One good thing about working alone is that there are no group distractions. Example you might have that one person in your group that does nothing and just fools around the whole time. Never...

One of the benefits in working in a group is being able to get your work done quicker rather than working by yourself. For example what if you have an SA due in a week and a slideshow to go with it? But you had a choice to to work by yourself or within a group,''I wouldn't think twice about it, I would go with a group"".

Also In groups you can discuse and interact with your peers. Groups can also help one another and give eachother feed back depending on what your working one.

Another benefit working within a group is being able to have multiple ideas, thoughts rather than just you having to think and work on everything by yourself. This is the best thing there is to working in a group is that all of you have ideas weather there the same or diffrent,groups can combine eachothers thoughts and ideas to make somthing incredible.

Weather its working in a group project at school or your partisipating in a high end business group its all set to say that working in a group is way benificial than working alone.                        "

3766,FA08CD5A2E48,"Sometimes when you are not doing anything or just do not do something physical, some good or great things could happen surrounding you and the world.

My first idea that makes inactivity a ""self work"" in progress. Meaing letting people around help you instead of you doing everything yourself. A movie called ""Christopher Robin"" shows that as a child, Christopher did things before but he had imaginary animals helping him.

The purpose of the movie, is to give the auidience the understanding of what it means to be always doing something, always occupy yourself with the simplest things that you do not really have to do. And adding pressure on yourself. Than letting others help you, can create good things surrounding you and you can have good thoughts. Because when you are stressed you are worried about how things will be in the future. Having people help you can still have great success that can be accomplished.

The example or message in this movie shows when Christopher is an adult and he pre-occupys himself a lot, the more problems is caused with his life. He almost lost his wife and daughter because he was always occupied doing his business job. Later when he realizes he was on the wrong track, his friend, pooh was telling him he is not the same as himself before. He told himself the only way he'll be less stressed and worried is to become the child inside him and bloom once more. Letting your inside child out, he needs to find himself doing absolutely nothing, no stress, and just spend time with the life he has been given and his family. After doing that, he was more gifted than before, like this idea he had for how to make his business better but had never presented because he was always doing something

Like the thesis was talking about not doing something physical could lead to some good or great things, Christopher found himself at the end. He is happy and relaxed with what he accomplished when he let go and did nothing. Now he realizes the result of doing nothing and how different it would have been if he kept on occupying himself in things he should not be worried about rather than enjoying what he has to thank for. So the key is that if Christopher Robin can accomplish great or good things by doing nothing rather than doing something, then that means everybody else can learn as well the understanding to find success and move ahead."
940,480C577BC8C9,"There is some schools that let the students use their cell phones to do classwork or any other educational purposes, and that follows some advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages are, you will be able to finish your work in class and not having work left to do for homework. This was very helpful for me, because I had the chance to do my classwork or my homework using my cell phone or the other devices to finish as much as I can of work before I get home. Some of the disadvantages will be, after the students finish using their cell phones to do the classwork, they will keep using it for things other than the classwork, like checking social media, or texting,

or watching youtube, that what I saw in my classroom, I saw students were watching youtube videos or texting, or some other things that they shouldn't be doing it and wasting their time on it. People sometimes don't realize or think about how are they wasting their time by using the cell phone. Teachers should be stricts about having and using a cell phone in classroom. Students get in trouble because of the cell phone, they don't think before they use the phone, they do what they want without thinkng about the risk that they might get into. Use your cell phone, but you got to use it wisley, so you won't get in trouble and wasting time.       "
3783,FA72E7D170D5,"You never try to do something by yourself unless what you have already mastered, you will not grow all the time. You just will like a child and never grow up. Are you do something without any mastered? Even you are a young child, but you cannot always ask you parents and said "" Mom (Dad) , i don't know how to do this one, i don't know how to do that one."" And let your parents to do all of something for you. You never try, and you will never grow.

You are not a baby, you have to try to do something by yourself. When i was a child, do not understand what is ""do you own thing by yourself ?'' My sister (older than me) ,she always told me '' help me to wash the dishes; help me to hang up the clothes...''

She never will do this a little thing. Have once time , my grandmother saw me and asked me '' what are you doing over here, is too dangerous. Come over here, quickly."" '' Who let you to hang up the clother ?'' My grandmother said. I decrease my noice, and told her : '' is Generic_Name.'' Then my grandmom was angery,and told my sister :'' Why are you is so lazy, you can do al of this thing by yourself.'' Then, my sister, she was cry very lough.

If you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you are not be a success person and grow in your life. You have a big, samrt brain. In my memory, i am a lazy person. I do not know how to do that thing, but i do not want to think about how to do that, i will go to ask my parents or my sister.

The people in the world, they should have a little mastered when they do something else. A little mastered for every things, you will half of success.

No people is very perfect in the world, only when you want to do better than last time.         "
3862,FE459F8CF4CE,"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", this phrase said by the American jazz legend Duke Ellington means that if you have a problem you can use it to improve yourself and I agree with this statement because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger.

Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you don't know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation.

Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again.

Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and in that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem.

In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. So if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you."
1928,91377BE7D4ED,"Imagine if you could do school from home and have time to relax or do more stuff. I would love to be studying from my house because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they don't have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport.

A lot of students get stressed in the morning because they don't know what to wear for school. What if they didn't have to worry about that anymore? I don't like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students don't have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying.

All students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they don't do it on time because it's too stressful for them to finish it all. Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. My friends and I are always stressed because of how much school work we have to do, but if we could do online school, it would all be so easy and less stressful. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work.

Everyone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Maybe it's a sport or a job or it could be both. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse.

Some might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. they don't need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat aren't related to school like sports or jobs. How nice would it be if we didn't have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.             "
1663,7E530A20DA68,"People and students' have some amazing talents and skills. Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time.

When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students' had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin.

Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting.

Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience.

They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy.    "
1918,907FC59841EC,"I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family.

some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students don't have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor.

If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

To sum up I think school should be the some as it is or take sum time of school because is too long to add time to it. All in all school help as to learn."
338,194E86ED4117,"My dad usually told me that failure is the mother of success when i was young. Way to success is not easy, everyone had to face different kinds of problems. It will fell harder and harder every time you failed, and it's hard to keep up the enthusiasm while facing different kind of problems. Yes, i'm fully agree with Mr. Churchill.

Failure lead you to success. Simple example about Elon Musk, one of the richest people on planet Earth. He was the Chairman of PayPal, Tesla. At 2002 he invented SpaceX, first ever self-investment rocket company to reach the Earth's orbit. Also, most amazing thing is they invented the reuse rocket, which is the rocket will land back to earth after launch to the Earth's orbit. SpaceX has accomplished so many that people talk about their success so much without remember their failure. Let me tell you this: The first 2 of their rocket(Falcon 1) launch are all failure due to engine failure. after during a other year of researching, testing, and examine, the 3rd rocket launch still failed to reach the Earth's orbit. At that time everyone think this project is a jock and Elon only have the money to launch the 4th rocket. Without losing hope and years of hard work, their 4th rocket(Falcon Launch 4) was successfully launched and reach the Earth's orbit. Elon and SpaceX made history, SapceX also received a large amount of money by NASA.

Don't ever lose your enthusiasm(Hope). Don't Never Ever Give Up, one of the greatest quote of all time, it lead so many people to success. Like Elon Musk i talked about last paragraph, he is a great example for us. His enthusiasm and passion about Space transpiration in the future and even moving people to space lead him and his company into success. I'm a sports athlete, i play basketball for 5 years already, it's part of my life. Every athlete knows practice is boring but also important. Why so many people still play professional basketball is because they have the passion and enthusiasm about winning. Process is boring and long, however it only take one moment for sports athlete to fell everything is worth it. Still some people failed on their way, beat by the tiredness of the process and slowly lose their enthusiasm for what they are chasing for at the beginning.

Failure complete the adventure, last thing i'm going talk about today. Everyone is emotional, everyone hate losing, everyone wanted to take the short cut. I'm the everyone, you are the everyone too, but without the gaps on the road to success, the adventure just seems not complete. Every failure make the explorer more stronger and smarter. Learn from the mistake, take note from it and you will be step ahead from everyone else. Every person on this planet with big accomplishment also have big mistakes too. No one is perfect, just go do thing what you want or like to do, eventually the journey will become interesting.

All for all, guess you already tired of reading. i support my 3 main points: Failure lead you to success, don't ever lose your enthusiasm, failure complete the adventure. I'm also agree with Mr. Winston:'' success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.'' Failure does play a important role in the pursuit of success."
2873,D044FCEAE0D7,"Based on my experiences

I agree with Emerson's statement when he said, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''. sometimes in life we have to do things that we already have mastered but it never grow. One time when was little child I learned that I can't master the things that I already have done.

For example; My brother took his master degree when he was 22 years, now he wen back to school to take his master degree again .He regret what he already took his master degree in the past and come back to take it again it did't help him it all. another example my friend decided open his old store after the government shut it down. he open store and the government came and shut it down again. I learned in this life somethings that we mastered we should leave it behind and move on to different things. I try do something I dont liked it didn't work it all but when I try work on the stuff and things that I like it works and master it no matter what the thing is. This why in life we should master the things we like and never go back to it .

While, I understand that some people disagree with Emerson's statement when he said, ''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow'' and could be right sometimes we should master all the things we have been done in the past .

These are the reasons and specific examples why I agree with Emerson's statement when he said

''Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow''.  "
719,375ABFC3D6F5,"The school cafeteria plans to change to a new healthier school lunch menu. One reason that I think that is best to change the school lunch menu is that it could eliminate bad eating habits. Students can learn to eat without being tempted to eat junk food at school. Another reason on how you can switch the food is by substituting the schools junk food by exchanging it with something much more tasty and nutritious food that could lead into healthy eating routine to all the students.

Some students say that they disagree on changing the school lunch menu.

If were to eliminate students favorite school lunch meals; it could lead to them not to eat or buying junk food outside of school.

However school lunch teachers are preparing tasty, and nutritious lunch ideas to serve to their students. Eating a nutritional diet could increase focus in class, increase lifespan, and minimize harmful toxins and bacteria to the body. Changing the school cafeteria lunch for healthier menu."

305,1649A2246587,"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people. "
2706,C76DBCE18AF0,"Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people don't get along because they think different about each other.

In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when I'm going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if I'm going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I don't know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, I'm going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions.

I think that if you're trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you can't change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they can't change it, because is a part of their lives. Even the animals have first impressions, because when you are trying to buy a dog, the dog is going to have a first impression because the dog is getting an owner. So that's why First impressions are almost impossible to change."
991,4BF17A253013,"I desagree whit this statement, because some people can change, how people look at them and given a good impression again, for example if the person dirend do well the first time, he would do better the second time, it is like given a second opportunity, second example is that the person who you are given the opportunity to change, is not doint nothing to change it, is better to not give them a second chanse.

For me the first impression is not to much important, because that firt impression can change at any time, and the the one how you diren t give him a second change, cand be better tha the firt one my experience whas one day i have do a poster, and my was ugly when the teacher say that whe have to do other poster in a group and nobody whant to join my group, and i finishet by myselft wen te teacher calify the poster, may whas te best one in the class."
1496,736E8C8444E6,"Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.

However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.

In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.

To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.

That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

Technology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. Furthermore parents have to a limitation on their kids and put a limit on them."

By having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is when they can enjoy their break to do what they want for fun.

First reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is because they can spend time with their family. For example, the whole family can got to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile. By spending more time with their family; consequently, teens can be more closer to their family. Teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip.

another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends. For example, teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym. In addition, teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip.

Lastly, on why students should know that summer vacation, is for them to enjoy, is that they are away from school, by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them. For example, students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning. However, teens can have more time in their hands, instead of having to learn.

In conclusion, these are the three most important opinions, on why teens should know that their summer is for them to enjoy, by having more time for summer vacation, teens can enjoy more time with their family and friends."
1580,78DD2317E359,"What Minister Churchill is trying to say is that going from failure to success is not gonna be easy in life. What could they do to reach their career and have success? People will agree with this statement. Not everyone is gonna succeed in life, we all make mistakes. People just got to try harder even if it takes years to achieve. Failure is not the end of the world, people just got to find what is best for them. Going from failure to success in life is not easy, but they just got to have the potential to reach that goal.

First, some people may tell others that going from failure to success is a good thing. For example, my friends told someone that playing basketball is not a good sport for him, but overtime he has gotten better at basketball. Most people in the world are gonna say ""practice makes perfect."" Another example is that my sister wanted to go to UVA, and she studied hard to get into that college, my family thought they wouldn't accept it, but a few weeks later, they accepted her in UVA. Things aren't gonna be easy, people just got to understand that it is life, we just got to work harder.

On the other hand, most people in the world experience this. There is not one person in the world that didn't have any issues throughout their whole life. Even in school, it is very unlikely to find someone that is not having a hard time with there classes. Everyone was not smart when they were born, people got to work for it to get smarter. Here is another example, my Math and History have good grades, but my English and Science don't have good grades, so not everyone is gonna have good grades, people have strengths and weaknesses, they just got to study and work because not everyone is perfect.

In addition, some others may say that going from failure to success is a waste of time. Others say that it won't help their career in the future. People think that there is a lot of information in school, college, and even a job that they have to go through just to have success in life. They also say that they have to work hard to pay for their house, their bills, health insurance, car insurance, and even for their family. The people in the world that say that it is a waste of time are the people that can be homeless or the people that just have no life at all.

Lastly, the reason why that everyone should always go from failure to success is because it's gonna make people feel good about there selves. Another reason why you should be successful is if people finish everything they need for their career, then they don't have to deal with it in the future than having to deal with it later. Also, it is a good idea if they study and learn the materials they could accomplish. Even if people don't succeed in life it is fine because they still have a chance, all they got to do is to study hard and work hard for it because in the future they will not regret it.          "
1268,61471CA2532D,"In my experiences be disagree with this statement because everybody have different personalitie, The person have one day bad, and the persona change.

however the first impressions can be change, Everybody have different personalitie becuase the people make much caracterist tha see different for example a person can have much cualidad that other people don't have, Also do not always other person have that be yourself.

The person have one day bad becuase something the people in the school can have stressful for example when have so much homework during in class , also the person in the job is possible that have problem for example the other person can cause conflict and making is mad.

However the people change becuase they can have a good expression of a manner that your attitude can be esplendi,

for example no every person have bad comportamient.

In conclusion every one can be different personalitie and not is imposible change our impressions have that be we yourself."
1724,82BA3E4396CC,"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling.

Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.

Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.

Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came.

Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day.      "

The british naturalist is right because people make bad chooice sometime it dosen't mean they are bad. My character will show that how much i can do the right thing. Influence beyond control your mind but it mean you have to strong and kind to other. I control myself to do bad and good things i can only control me and my action that can be a issue. I make misstake and l can learn from my own mistack that are right. This is also supports how i act to other and be truth to myself. Sometime you don't have to be selfish but their many selfish human being that do the wrong things and they know what they doing even that were wrong.

For example i did losed control went i am not thinking postivie and choosing to be nagative that's why people need to know how to be able to control them self. Thinking postivie is't force it's come by influences and the people you around with not always the you round with their know how to control them sefl but it is not them that you can't depond on you have to learn your own and not all people are bad to hanging out with. I believe that one person can change the whold world just by their bravery and thinking postivie to them self i may not be prefact but i know how to control myself just by thinking postivie and think before i said or do anythigs.

1892,8E99E989024A,"We should have after school homework club because, some students need help with their classwork, some students don't pay attention and they could use after school to understand the topic and what they have to do, and they could improve their grade for classwork and homework. For example when I was in Elementary school, I use to stay after school for homework club because I couldn't understand anything so I stayed after and got help from my teacher.

To begin with the homework club is good because for some students that need help could stay after with her/his teacher and do what they have to do with their teacher. Also they could get help by finishing their homework and classwork. Some students go home and ask their parents for help but some parents doesn't remember the question or don't know how to do it. So it's helpful for students to have homework club and get help from their teacher.

My other reason is that some students doesn't understand the question and it's hard for somebody that doesn't understand their language. For example when I came here three years ago I didn't know any English neither my parents so i had to stay after, and get help from my teacher to understand what is the question asking me to do. Another example would be when students don't pay attention in class or fall a sleep it's good for them to stay after school and get help from their teacher to understand.

Finally students could get improve by staying after and learn better. Some students have bad grade for homework or their classwork, so they could stay after to get improved. Also students can improve their understanding. For example my cousin use to have bad grade for homework, so he stayed after school, and got help from his teacher, and learn better, and got improved.

Lastly all of this reasons and details are why school should have after school homework club. Students need help with their homework and to get improve. Also some students don't have time in classrooms to ask their teacher for help so they could stay after school and get help after school. Teacher also can support students to stay after school and do their homework."
3082,DB050381035B,"Some people may say that oppocite but to start with your aim low helps with the little mistakes that need to be fixed.

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff.

The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aim's low and achieve a mark. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there.

Some people will star high thinking that by doing that they would be able to get on top of stuff and all problems that are along with that are somehow fix without putting any effort or even think about it for a second,people should star a bit lower than that because that way they can work built that character that can help with achieven their goal by just putting a bit of effort and try to not aim high and fall short. For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

Setting the aims at a low risk help with not losing what it was to hard to get or to achieve,by understanding that thats what help getting far in life and not let anything fall short and just taking the time to think and overview that things that are still around and star making them better and just work on them step by step. As some may say that its good for people to chalenge themself once in a while but without risking whats around it because whats the point of being able to work so hard and by just one step that was taking without having a chance to think of what was happening and lose it all by not taking it step by step.

My oppinion is that people should considere think before doing anything because that what helps getting you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face,by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top,and if your going to chalenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it."

628,2F81111E7831,"Most student enjoy summer vacaction,but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that student do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

Most of the student have reason that is to much break during summer break, but I am disagree with the idea of change the schedule of vacaction time. Could be during summer break the student forget some information of school, but all student wait for summer because much student like to travel to their country during vacation time, or some student only can see their family during summer break and their like to pass time with them, I guess is better time to take vacation in summer. Also the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is really bad and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go out side.

Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair. I think 3-4 week break during summer is a little be of time to have fun with the family, and enjoy their vacation I dont see the main point of the change because if they change the longer break for winter it take the same time because they also want that student take a week break durin spring and falls; Is more complicated if they change the schedule.

Therefore is a bad idea to change because it should be the same way it doesnt matter what time or what station is the break it should be the same way, because if they do in winter they going to forget information, eather is not good idea because the student cant enjoy their break for the weather.

In conclution I am desagree with the idea and is better during summer break, because could be the same time that the student loose. "
330,1849B89A02D6,"Thomas Jefferson said its amazing how much is done if we work hard, do we accomplish by doing something or does doing nothing have a purpose? If we doing something everyday we could accomplish something like if you exercise every day with healthy meals you will be losing weight and burning calories, if we do not do nothing and don't take care of your self you'll gain weight, see stretch marks on your body or even get diagnosed by diabetes or even something even more serious like a stroke, heart attack, and organ failure.

Everyday people accomplish things for example: work people who work in construction have to work through some harsh conditions when its freezing or when its flaming hot. From my experience of working in construction I was a laborer working for ten hours, I as a laborer had to make sediment, mix for placing cinder blocks, carry buckets of water, cinder blocks, fill in the the holes with concrete, had no breaks only lunch, set up scaffolds and lift long heavy wooden planks and climb up and set the pallets of cinder blocks and water for the mix so it doesn't dry.

A Japanese manga artist named Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, even though both stories are fantastic but the one who stuck out the most is Dragon Ball. a young Akira saw a manga tournament who had the best manga it took him a couple tries to win and that lucky day he saw a editor from Toei Animations and told Akira great job from there he got confident and inspired that he could make something happen. later on he kept making mangas until he made one called dragon boy and one other manga and he combine both them and created dragon ball, he created Goku the main character and gave him the personality of Akira. Akria sold more than nine million copies of dragon ball from that money he made a studio call Bird Studio for his animations. Once Dragon Ball got so popular in Japan Toei Animations bought the anime from Akria and made the next Dragon Ball series called Dragon Ball Z. Dragon Ball has been around 32 years since it released in the U.S. and it still going and getting more popular. This year in January 14 the new Dragon Ball Super Broly came out in the U.S. and made one hundred million in the box office, one of the most famous anime and one of the best selling anime movies of all time.

2673,C5B351564A3F,"According to this prompt can you imagine that some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to conserve energy and resource. However, now did you ask to your self, should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours?. went i think in that i give me some thing. although, follow this model by extending the school day two hours have benefists and disadvantages of follow this model to a four day of school week .

fist, think about benifist that is very important part for students and for the employees , however consider how this model is going to help students and employees from school. Then how this model is going to help the school if they dont conserve energy and resourse. For instance, teachers are affected in how they give students work when they need some proyect to do how they use energy if they dont have resources. Now left think about if school dont have resourses how students use the restroom if dont have water, students also use water to get a shower went they have a game in the school, another think is that women in the kitchen they need water for cook and give students lounch. However, some students work after school and teachers needs to take care their childres after school or some teachers live very far. Beside, they could affect school education. Lastly, school are affected for many manner this affect whith the hours being to a four day school week in the other hand,

let meask abouth disadvantages.

Second, students,teachers and employes are affected in the disadvantages. For example, some students work after school if students wants to stay after school maybe they lost their jobs because they dont present to his work or if they have some homework to do after school they can no stay because they need to work studens are affected. Beside, teachers are affected too because after school they need to take care they childrens or maybe some teachers live very far and spend many time for arive to his home. In the other hand, school employes lost his work because if school work only four day at week the drive lost some hours of job this affect some employes and their families. Thats why this dissadvantages affect studens work and students education because some students dont came to the school if they are resposable with his job. However in my case this affect me because i work after school and i need came to the school too but i need some money. They are many reasons why this disadvantages affect students and employees. Let me ask some benefist that is good.

Finally should fallow this model by stending four day school week you should have some benefist. For example, you should have one day off to stay at home with family, do the homeworks that the teaches give you or spedn more time to study, teachers can relax one day or maybe they prepare students assignment.

In conclution, to conserve energy and resource to considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week, many pleople are affected mostly students and teachers because two hours would affect students job, also the teachers because some teaches live so far from the school and they dont have time to past with his family. In the other hand, the good thing is that they should have one day off and they can relax, students can do their homewors and they can study for his test or maybe they can go to his job in the day off. But is important can to the school every day because we need to learn more every day and in the future can take a better job we can do a good people and a good example for our family.    "
17,01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like.

Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they can't stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions.

Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law.

I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well.

In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot."

for example if you want to open a buisness of finances in your community but you do not know how because you never try to do it you ask someone that have already mastered of doing it and you can start doing your buisness because you already try and you learn how to do it. another example would be going to college and there is a class that you already know because you take it in high school and you explain the thing to your friend and you are a mastered doing it and one of you friends ask you for another class problem but you do not because you haven try the class but it sound interesting and you want to try it because you want to learn new thing and try not matter what your situation is in your life be confident of your self. other example would be try to cook and learn your self that can teach you that you can try by your self and learn by your self but you try and that what it matter you try.

Try new thing help you learn and learn help you grow as an individual and as a community for example you grow as an individual because you take the class that you friend ask you before and you did it answer him because you haven even try then you try and become a mastered doing it and you open a buisness the community start growing and you open more buisness you become more important and the community grow more as well as you and you became someone important for the community and you keep having chance to be better every time that you learn you start helping people that do not have a chance to imprube them self. an for teach your self of cooking is a motivation to other to try the same thing.

You can help people when you grow because you learn how to do the work and now you teach the work to other to they can have a better chance in life giving them a place to work and having them grow as well the community grow because the buisness that you open people was more interesting in your buisness and they make you offers and tell you to work with them but you are scared that you work may not work but you remember that if you do not try and stay of what you are mastered you would not grow. cooking your self help the community to have people to get in head and teach others.

Even if you do not have try something and you think you can do it and you fell, you would be more sad that you do not try before you do it or ask someone for help that ready do it is a big mistake, try before you do not grow ,you do not have to be conform of what you already have because you can help others and make your self be proud and cooking for other and tell then that you learn by your self is a inspiration to other do the some thing and the way that you grow as trying thing would make the community more interesting try to grow before you give up."
2617,C209AAD70DDE,"Imagine if we accomplish more, if we are always doing something. Some people accomplished their goals in life, but some people dont do nothing to accomplished what they want. I would like to accomplish my goals in life; there are three thing that I would like to accomplish: having a success career, graduate from high school with an advance diploma, and studied the area of medical. I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community.

My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad.

My second reason, helping our community. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live. Helping other people good or bad. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries.

My last reason, being active anywhere we are. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people.

Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. Being active is very important because of your health. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout. Some people accomplish something and some people dont accomplish nothing. If people accomplish what they want, there, would be no purpose. In mt opinion people should accomplish what they want in life. I hope people could accomplish something in life."
2940,D371D73ACCC2,"Some People Believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem,even if the work is not the students best effort. they believe that students must be self confident to learn.

I do not, i believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too.

In truth I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that i started to not care as much as i used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually i came to terms with the fact that not all my work was gonna be perfect, but if i spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better.

So what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise.

The best way to actually build confidence is through achievement's,when you accomplish something and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half baked work most people get credit for.

Once you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your home work on time, when a test comes up you would be very well prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself.

In conclusion having false praise & hope is bad it lowers your standards and makes your work ethic terrible the only good way to build self-esteem is through achieving something out of hard word and dedication."
2631,C2F34D6A76D4,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Although the word failure is the lack of success, is the loss of the ability to work normally. As humans, we all know that sometimes instead of get better in life, we currently loss our capacities to start over and follow what we want for us because as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""do not loss the enthusiasm"".

To being, humans fail every time in life, every episode in our life there is always a failure, it is always there for us like if we need it and maybe this is why we always wondered why failure have to happen during the most incredible episode in our life, we always think this is because we did something bad or we did not tried our best as much as we can for get that job, pass that test or even keep all our problems in line, but why failure became a big role into our daily life?.

The reality of failure is not only fail, is to see what we did bad to get better, is to understand that we need to fail, understand that fail is good for us and help us to do not make the same mistakes that we did in the past because every time is a failure it is also an experience and a new lesson to success.

For example, scientists tried many experiments to just get one result and they fail very often but at the end they discovered new things not just only what they were looking for. This shows that not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer and new things to discovered.

Furthermore, stay positive for humans could became a big issue in our community. Every human try everyday to stay positive and see all the mistakes as much positives as we can but this became more stressful after a failure.

What we all need to know is that feel stress, feel insecure of ourselves is good. We all are humans, our feelings make us more stronger than we actually are however, most people could feel depress after a failure and this is why we goes down, we loss our hope and most people stop to keep working in their goals and just get tired and feel depress.

For example, there is a book that the students of Generic_School were reading last year called ""The life of an Indian"". This book is about a poor Indian boy that lives in a reservation, he has no hopes after one day his teacher introduced the Indian to a different world out of the reservation to find hope and believe in himself, follow his dreams instead to keep poor in the reservation. He fail a thousand times, but instead to get back, he goes thought his issues.

This shows that stay positive after our failures even for a poor little boy is not always too hard. Clearly not everyone could do it that way, but we always want our happiness, and to get happiness, failure could became our big right hand.

In conclusion, join from our mistakes is the best way to be successful, to be better in life, to keep in mind that every failure is a new experience and a new lesson. Not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer.

I am completely agree with Winston Churchill, feel enthusiasm for what go next in our life is more excited than we all think and as humans, if we start to believe in ourselves and stay positive and start to dream and also understand that failure is part of our daily, we will become more successful with the knowledge to how life really works and that life is not too hard as we all been thinking.

3729,F88A0801C9EB,"In my opinion it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. If you're committed to anything you will always want to achieve that certain goal. Having a career you are committed to at a young age has many positive outcomes. One of the outcomes is you can find a career much faster. Another positive outcome is having a goal that you want to achieve. The final positive outcome is having more time in high school to do other activities. Having a certain career you want to achieve at a young age will make you improve on lots of things.

You will find a career much faster if you're committed to one specific career at a young age. If you are focused on that certain career you will be doing things that you need to achieve to have that certain career you have been planning at a young age. For example when you are committed to that one certain career you will be taking specific classes. Finally when you sign up for that career or try out for that career you will most likely get accepted since you will have experience. Having experience on a career will help you so much when applying for a career. People will most likely see that you have experience and want to hire you. That is why it is better having a career you are committed to at a young age.

If you have a goal you want to achieve at a young age you will do anything to achieve that goal you since you're committed to achieve that goal. It is also just like being committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in order to achieve a goal you will need to do anything it takes to achieve it. As in a career you need to study as much as you can of the career and take classes that will help you achieve the career you are interested in. If you have a goal you will most likely achieve the goal if you try and never give up. If you give up on the goal you will not succeed. Just like in a career you are committed to at a young age. If you give up on the career you will most likely need to find another career and learn new things and start all over. That is why you should have a career already planned at a young age so you won't give up later on and need to start all over.

You will have more time in high school to do more activities if you are committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in high school their are many sports , clubs , and other after school activities you can do or tryout for. If you already have a certain career in mind since you were little and young you can have more time to do sports and other activities that can also help achieve that certain career you are interested in. Also it is good having more time to do other things instead of still not knowing what career you want and having to speak to counselors , teachers , and searching up careers you are interested in doing. If you already planned your career when you were young you won't have to worry about having to look for a career and having to stress out. Some students stress out if they don't have a career in mind and not knowing what career they want to do. Having more time to yourself and not needing to worry about finding careers is much better than looking for careers and needing to take new classes to have that certain career that you are just planning to have. That is why it is better to be committed to a career at a young age.

Overall having a career to be committed to at a young age is better than not having any career planned out for the future. You will get the career quicker than usual. You will have an achievement you will want to accomplish. You will have a better schedule to do and focus on other things. This will improve lots of your characteristics and improve you as a person. It will show you how committed you are and how you can get anything done. When you get the career youve been committed to since you were young you will be proud of yourself since you have been committed and focus on that career like all your life.                        "
2637,C3668997E921,"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators.

One of the first lessons I'll share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them ""give me a pencil"" you should tell them ""may I please have a pencil"". Also if you don't be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word ""respectful"" is not the only word you can use there's other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these ""other words"" are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is ""respect"".

Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life it's always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities you'll get.

Lastly, being good communicators. In life you'll always have to communicate if it's your friends, teachers or your family, you'll always be communicating. For an example, I can't communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I don't want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends.

And those would be the things I would share to elementary school students to always learn, to be respectful and, be good communicators "
3161,DE962FEDCD9E,"Being a successful person in life require some essential things. Successful person is someone who achieve goals in life and make dreams true. People who are preising for a good work will feel great and ready to start a new project to progress in life. People who have a success life can be because they haved teachers who praising they for doing outstanding school's project so, this inspirated they to try the best they can and be a successful person in their future. However somepeople believe praising a student's work to build self-steem is a good idea nevertheless, I think the source of true self-steem is archievement because, praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem and students will have the ambition to improve their skills and archieve something to their future.

Praising students who did a great job will feel amazing and also, it helps to have a better self-steem. Students feel great when someone is praising them so, this help they to feel better and happy. Positive personalities become to a good self-steem also, this make a better environment. Students with a good self-steem will be doing a better job and will make true the things their love. Praising great students can help to other students to try to do a better job like that great student and be praising like they. Praising students who did a great job will be benefitial for the entire classroom becoming a positive environment and making the students more active to do a better job to be praising like an outstanding student and this help they to progress and do things better.

students will have the ambition to improve their skills and archieve someting to their future. The students in a classroom will want to be outstanding students so they will trying the best they can and start to progressing to reach that goal. Students with a good self-steem and smartness will want to have a great future and the ambition to be a better student every day. Praising students help they to improve their skills and doing their best. Students who are praising for a great job will help they to improve teir skills and do better jobs every day and become outstanding students.

In conclution, the source of true self-steem is archievement because when a great student is praising will have the ambition to improve every day more to become a better student. My suggestion is to start praising great students to make they and others to feel the ambition to be better every day and create a smart, competitive and happy environment."
1936,924748264D34,"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.

First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. That's why I think elective classes was important.

secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time.

In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I don't understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.

Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.

Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school."
2272,A9F7B20A9483,"On my opinion I be agree with the statement because He was one of the minister,who has more power from other's. Ms Winston had to help other's. For example giving hand and talk about what they can do. The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go.

Them Let's say on my class my teacher ask to work with others I had to work and show up. For example: let's talk about work in group,help each other giving ideas to we can add on the project. The terms was tried if you fails show up and do cause there is how you can be better. If you make a mistake no problem on other time you can do more better on my opinion there is how the minister can work.

In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree. Because if they do not be agree with the statement was cause they had to know that and see is the achievement work successful too.

Now I take the my position on my opinion many people like me came to this country and looking for better opportunities to we don't have in our country. Also we had to learn the languages what is hard but we tried to what we can do and show up how we can be better on the future.

But many student had a long history or someone didn't graduated cause many student had to pay rent or thing to what's hard to work after school and don't have to much time to sleep, any ways we had to work hard.

Also many student show what they can do and how far they can go, Also many emigrant people came here to found a safe place to live so the mind on our country we don't many security.

Now I'M be here work hard, sometimes I like to help people when they get travel or didn't understand what we do. Also I tells them to din't do bad things cause if you get travel you get problem them your record contain a bad thing, until now I to my best it's hard sometime to understand but everyday when I be at home I practice or read book thats one thing can help everyone who want to learn more English. For example if you read a book like 20 minutes you learn and know how to pronounce that work that help you to main ten your vocabulary an read faster.

I'm a student who like to help others and like to share new ideas with other and talk about what we want to on a future. a couples of thing I want to share are : thanks the program for help us and the teacher who help us with new things everyday."
3554,F131A67F5B95,"Being yourself is better than try to be someone else, being yourself brings you a true friends, not afraid to know who you are, and the most important is that you are honest. When someone is dishonest the person will not have true friends, maybe the person do not know who is. Being someone else is the greatest accomplishment in this world.

Being yourself brings a true friends.

In this world we love to make friends. Why? it because friends never let you down when we need them. Friends brings as happiness in our life, we can count with their time in conditional, friends are gift of God, whatever place we go, we always are going to find a friend. Friends are like family, they there for you no matter what, sometimes we fight with them but they will there for us because they know that you are being a true friend. Being our selves we always going to successful whatever we go.

Being yourself is know who we are. Know who we are, is being honest with our selves and not only with our selves same thing with the society that is around us. However;

some people might not likes us too much because of our action and the way how we talk hurt them. One action talk a lot of a person because demonstrate that that person know who he is. Know who we are helps with our self steam, also we make friend, the love of people and most important is that we loved who we are and not act like if we are someone else.

Finally being honest, is the best action that a person can have in life no lies, no disappointed on people, no issues. Being honest is how we can have true friends, not only true friends, we earn the respect of every single person that we work with or meet in life. People will trust in a person that is honest. not in a person that is dishonest. Whatever place we g, we most be honest with all kinds of people no matter what. Friend, teachers, family, etc; will not disappointed on us, if we are honest every single thing will work for as , there is not issues when a person work honest, it is all the contrary.

Being yourself is the best choose than try to be someone else, being yourself you re not fear to know who you are. Also, the most important is that you are going to made, ""real friends"". However, honest is a strong part of being yourself. No matter what, stay the same, because try to be someone else will hurt you and all the people that is around you. Stay your self eventho the world constantly tries to make you something else."
3356,E80C88E9837C,"I agree with Churchill' statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of succes, because the way to become to the success is not gonna be easy. All the people that try to have a good success they gonna have failure on the way and sometime they fall apart, but they never have to loss their enthusianm, because the succes consists in fall apart and wake up again, and keep going looking for a good success that gonna be graet for their life and their family gonna be haughty of them.

I agree because, the life gonna put many impediment to have a good success we have to keep going do not have to loss aur enthusiasm, for example. My family came of a poor family, but I have an ancle that he never loss his enthusiasm of has a good success, so he worked too hard for it. One failure that he has on his way to the succes was the poorness, but he keep going wrestlering for get uot of the poorness and help his father and mother, one day he found a job and begin to meke money and his first thing that he made was to buy a bed for him, then he to begin to save money to come to this country, now he has a lot money in his bank account because he put his own company of landscaping, but he never loss his enthusiasm about his success.

I agree with this statement, because there is a lot example of how the people have many failure and they keep going never loss their enthusiasm of their success, one of this example is of one soccer player his name is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a famous soccer player, but to have a great success he had many failure one of thase failure was that his father died when hi was a kid it was hard for him even has to see a psychologist and he to overcome that, he keep going looking for his success, but he failure again because the people and couche's that saw him, don't believe him they say like he doesn't has future, but he keep work in his success and show to all the people that don't believe him that they was wrong. Because he has a future and he gonna has a great success, now he is the best soccer player in the world for many people, but he always worked so hard to get out of the failure and he to obtain a good success.

I agree with Mister Churchill, because the way for a great success is gonna be long and we gonna have many filure to obtain this, for example. I am trying to graduate from high school, but one of failure was that it is not been easy for me, because this is a new language for me and it is dificult to talk, but I keeping going trying to get my diploma , another failure is that I have to work for pay may rent and buy my own stuff, shoes, clothes, and food, it make more dificult to have my success, but I know that success consists on fall apart and wake up, but I never loss my enthusiasm of to be graduate from high school. One day I gonna say that my success wasn't easy but I obtain a good success.

In Conclution I agree with ""churchill's statement about success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him because on the way to a great success we gonna have many failure but we don'thave to loss our enthusiasm, because in the world there is a lot people that they never loss their enthusiasm, even when they have a failure they always weke up and keek going, now they have a good success, so if we want a great success in our life we have to keep going wrestlering with all the failure that we gonna have. One day we gonna say I made it and we gonna have a great success.

Talking to people and persuading them to do good is influential, you can save someone's life by talking to them, you can help someone be successful by talking to them and influencing them to do good helping them take the right path to becoming successful, seeing someone fail knowing you could've spoke to them and influenced them on the right path would suck; I personally would feel horrible, sometimes all it takes is a couple words to influence someone. People don't always pay attention to your actions, people pay attention when their spoken to, when you talk to someone one on one it's so much easier to get their attention rather than you behaving good in class for example. Actions can determine the way you change someone's decisions, the way you behave can set a good example to other people but ask yourself would you rather have someone talk to you or you go off based on how someone else behaves?

Confidence in yourself is also a good way to influence people, you need to be confident in what you're going to say to the other person, you need to be assured of what you're going to say to them. In order for you to be confident you need to genuinely know that person in order to find ways to influence them. Once you talk to them and get to know them better you can go ahead and influence someone, it isn't always how you behave there are plenty of ways you can influence someone. Confidence in yourself is important because once you're confident everything will go smoothly, find out what the person likes and dislikes once you have that in hand you're good to go. Honesty plays a big part when it comes to influencing someone, why? When you speak with honesty you won't hesitate in what you're talking about, you won't feel guilty of lying because you're speaking the truth. Respect is also something you should when influencing someone, when you show someone respect the connection of the dialogue increases and the other person will be interested in talking to you.

Determination into influencing someone is probably the most important thing, when you're determined into doing something it's because you really want to do it, nothing is stopping you from doing what you're determined to do. When you're determined into influencing someone you feel secure in what you're doing, that's when confidence kicks in determination and confidence are somewhat alike, determination is when you've decided to do something and there's no turning back, once you feel determined influencing someone will be easy, especially if you know the person well. Decision making on yourself is important too, you can't go off influencing people to do wrong you need to do a self check and ask yourself if you're ready to influence people, you have to ask yourself do my actions match what I say, when influencing someone you want to influence them to do good not bad.

Preparation, you have to prepare yourself before going off to influence other people, why? Because you can't go off influencing people if you're not prepared to do so, do research on how to positively influence people, practice it with friends and family. Influencing people isn't easy, it takes a lot of practice, determination, confidence, respect and just getting to know the person well, once you have all those qualities you're able to go off and influence people that need help, people that need someone to talk them through, there are people out there that rather have someone talk to them and influence them on the right path rather than watching how other people behave.

Behavior isn't the only thing the only thing you can do to influence someone, to influence someone you need to be prepared, you need to have confidence in yourself before going and trying to convince people to do things how you tell them to because sometimes we feel like we're right but we never take the time and think if we're wrong or go back and see what you can improve in. Make sure you're on the right path so you can ahead and help someone else take the right path with you. Go ahead and influence someone just remember that your behavior isn't the only thing that people look at, people look at your qualities and how you approach them, make sure you do everything correctly and you'll be set.

The students we should to consider for what they permit us use our cell phone in the class, and they give us the opportunity and don't spend our time and others things and we should focus in our work.

Many student's when the teacher said you gays can use your phone in the class for search information or some work sometimes that we do is play video games, or see Facebook, Instagram or something else and we don't focus in that the teacher said in the classroom, and spend our time and things that affect us.

For example i know a person when i was in my country when we are in the class the teacher said search information in internet that story of this person or when we was in math class, uses our phone for the calculator but there was one girl that she never do that the teacher say and she start to see Facebook and send messages to his friend that are in the same class and that affect the persons who her is message sometimes there is students that they absolutely do that the teacher say or the school and that case, is really good idea use the cell phone cause help us in the class or to have more information about something that we want to know for example in my case i am a person that don't have too much time in this country, and sometimes when i am reading in my English class and find one word or sentence what i dont know what is that means i need search information about that for understand what am doing, is the same in my math class too much times i dont know how traduce symbols and need use my phone for that i think of that way is very good, school permit us use our cell phone too can be the best way for learn more things and makes our work in the way that the students likes also can be more helpful for the student's and also for the teacher's.

I think all depends of the student, use cell phone in class can affect or also can be good idea for learn in the school the school give us the opportunity, that use our phone we should that feel grateful for the opportunity and uses the phone for the work not for other things what can do that our grades come down.

1749,84192B65683A,"Community parks has it all open space, sun ,green grass, tables and a nice setting in general.

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future.

Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calorie's and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax.

Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he can't focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test.

In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. I hope this helps you with your every day situation."
3027,D8D90E042134,"In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying! And one important thing to no is, keep on trying, what you give, is what you'll receive."
3277,E3CCA8712549,"Some schools have a program that have older students and younger students. The older students help the younger students with activities or homework. But how will this program help both the older and younger students? Well, I will be telling you three things how this program is helpful for the older students and younger students.

First thing is, the younger students will want some help from the older students because they know more than the younger students and it would be a great help. If this program is still going than more and more students will start joining in and they can start forming groups and they can each work on something different.

secondly, this program can be very helpful by teaching students that are getting poor grades or poor scores on their test they're getting. Students can even donate binders,books,folders,crayons,pencils,pens,paper,etc. Even the students themselves can start their own fundraiser by making food and can raise money.

lastly, This whole program can be very useful for the community and helpful for the students. This is why this program is so helpful and important for us student and adults

In conclusion the older students help the younger students with activities homework/classwork. And that this program is really important to us."
1380,6A4F483B0224,"You will never grow into something you want to be in the future if you don't find your inner indite. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. No matter what they say, don't let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. Different things can have an impact in your life, but that's how we all stated from very beginning; we never known we had a special talent until we try something new."
2713,C7AC45EF9D03,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, it's not that easy and not everyone is able to to that.

For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run.

For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didn't give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I'm going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did.

In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. That's honestly what I am doing right now, since I'm still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.                           "
2847,CEE6F38D4ED6,"Yes, it would be nice for students to have a 3-4 of break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. students enjoy summer like everyone else. in my opinion, i'm a student and i would love that my school give us a 3-4 weeks off summer break, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. so that i can relax, go out with my family and friends, and do a lot off crazy things.

In summer we go to different places with my family, we like to travel, we go to crazy water parks, museums, and we go to the zoo sometimes. when you're in school you don't get a lot of time to spend with your family. because you get busy doing your homework and studying.

Summer is the best part of the seasons. in summer is always sunny outside, you can go to the beach, play soccer with your friends and brothers, you can do skateboarding .you can do a lot of things in summer.

In summer you can got to different places with your family. you can travel, visit a lot of places you don,t know and want to go there or you can just relax at your house watching movies, series or shows that you like to watch.

In conclusion i think having breaks is a good idea because you can relax, go out and spend time with your family and friends, and do a lot crazy things.                                   "
2183,A336FB5F2623,"Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who doesn't leave near the school, or doesn't own car, it could be helpful because student wouldn't had to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to WIFI.

By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes and they wouldn't have to worry about making other students sick and there would be less chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help those student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house so any bad weather could not be an obstacle.

There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion thats one negative thing of online classes, but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life."
3582,F2029DDE1D2B,"Do you think first impression is difficult to be change? Some people said that first impresion is difficult to change in a person. Firs impression can be change in some people because you can related to the person, You can talk to the person if is having a bad time, sometimes you can change the first impression to a person.

When i was in middle school i meet a girl, her name was Generic_Name, i didn't like her first impression and i noticed that she didn't like my impresion too. She was my neirbor for 3 years and she didn't talk to much and she was always angry. One day i notice that she was having problems with friends, like me. We were relatived to some things and our first impression.

Sometimes people can be having bad times and that is why their first impression it seems difficult to change. I had a friend that it was having a bad day at work the first time i meet him. Generic_Name was angry and he didn't talk to me that day. After that day i was surprised of his impression . Days after he explain what was happening to him that day.

If you meet a person more closedly you can change their first impression. You can be come a friend to the person, sometimes they change. You would like more that person than the first time. LIke i said before , they can have bad times the first time you see their impression. Not everyone is happy every day.

First impression is not difficult to change , people can due it and people can change it. some said that is impossible to change first impression , but is not , if i can due it with some people , you too can change it.

In the future we will see that first impression is not impossible to be change.  "

2126,9F1CC7603B64,"I agree about that some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, the students can would benefit. One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they don't need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school.

For example, if you work at home, you don't need permission to use the bathroom, because you're at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.

In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits. That's what I think that working online or video conferencing is a more easy way to lear for the students, and also I think is a big opportunity too."
1077,529A633179FF,"Have you ever wondered about the important's and the difference between imagination and knowledge? Knowledge and imagination are both very important but I think knowledge is more important. Imagination is like thinking about something, or putting your self in that situation, while knowledge is an understanding gained by actual experience and it is also known as something learned and kept in your mind. Knowledge helps a lot of people to get jobs so everyone should try to get a knowledge so they can use it to help other people that dont have a very good knowledge.

Majority of all the humans in the world get their knowledge from schools. They either get it from a public school which is made by the government or they get their knowledge from a private school which is made by and individual, or a group of people. Schools provide knowledge to students by putting them in classes with students that are their age. you need knowledge to give the students the information you learned, you cant be selfish with you knowledge because you must have been thought by some one, or you must have used someones resources to be intelligent. So if you a good education help other people that are not as smart as you because they can help you when you need it in life.

If there was no knowledge in the world there will be no electronic devices that we can use, there will be no new inventions. We are gonna need more doctors to study and find out the cures to all the new diseases that is spreading around the world thats why we have schools and teachers to help. I think all knowledge should be free from first grade to the end of your college year. having to pay for college education makes a lot of students drop out and do drugs and they always get addicted to drugs and alcohol they even try to be you tubers or rappers which must of the time does not work.

finally I disagree that imagination is more important than knowledge. So if you have a good knowledge you should be proud to share it with others. Imagination i also good for you but you should focus more on getting you knowledge so you can help others. helping others makes makes you feel much better about your self and it makes you day better."
936,475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone.

To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the store's stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals.

Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future.

As can be seen,

it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine. If the whole world have the willing to keep learning despite they are mastered in something already, they will be more professionals and a wealthier society."
23,01A65BA4080E,"Most schools let students use their cell phones during class for educational purposes, however, other schools don't think that allowing students to use their cell phones would be better than using computers in the library or computer labs, by allowing students to use their phones there will be a higher chance for them to get distracted doing what they are not supposed to intead of doing their assignments. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers.

Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and it's made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers.

By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates' phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well.

If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students' grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class' attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesn't mean that every student has to use their phones too.

Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers. By allowing us students to use our cell phones it's only increasing our chances to get distracted and it would make our grades drop. If we were aloud to use our cell phones during school we would not pay attention to our teachers and we would never get our work done. Us students should not be aloud to use our cell phones during school because it will not benefit us, it will only make us distracted. Teachers and parents would not be pleased if schools let students use their cell phones during class, we're teenagers and we get distracted very easily.       "
674,34317A7F1262,"I think is a good idea for young people to take a career a young age, because they are learning more stuff and when they going to the university they already going to know what career they are taking for their future, its good to them because they can be someone in their life doing their own stuff for them.

If they take a career in high school is going to be better learning the same stuff from the university. But is good idea if they take a career in the university because they can teach him better the stuff he need for a creer. The career is the future for young people doing the right stuff and thats why the most people want to take a career for their future, and high school are preparing them for the university. Thats why is good idea to selecte a career in high school thats the future for our lifes. The university help you a lot in the future if u want to be someone in your life you have to do the right things.

The university help you a lot in the future if u want to work in a big stuff, you can do it because u took the career in th euniversity. Thats why in high school we can selecte a career for our future. but at the same time is bad to take a career for other people because they are thinking, a lot of that and they can't not consentrate, in the stuff they doing. The career can make us a better person for our family, teaching them to the right things, we can do in your life to be someone everyone can be someone, if you ready to take a career.

Thats why we have to learn things in high school, for the future."
3889,FF4CBDA0E418,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. In my opinion first impression might be possible to change because people are different human with different habits and it depends on ourselves how we act and treat the person that we want to impress.

For example Generic_Name wanted to apply for a job in a clothing company named Dior which is a popular,expensive,and fancy brand he prepares himself for his first interview,he wears black suit and black shoes and starts heading to the office with his CV he have enough expeirence to be one of the employer in the company he impress his boss and thats how he gets his job.

In addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is because the people did not met each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their expeirence.

In conclusion I would say this statement is kind of equal disagree or agree becuase like I said people never know each other habits and what they like for example: what is their hobby, what they eat,what they like to wear, so at the end my opinion is I am disagree with this statement.   "
1700,80EF60E3EA04,"One school activity that kids enjoy are field trips because it provides them a brake from school work and it gives them a opportunity to explore their surroundings. Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. Teachers and staff may feel stressed planing the trips but in the end i think they enjoy it just as much as the students.

Middle school is a stressful time. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.

Schools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. Being in a building that's stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Everyday students asks to go outside. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. Students often look forward to the end of the day or field trips because it gives them air and a chance to breath. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.

In conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year.          "
2270,A9DA6C8A9555,"Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

I do agree because in your imagination you can think or do anyting you want. Knowledge is just using ur brain but it's not the same as imagination. Many people might agree with me because its just true. You can think of many ways; Therefore, all the things you think can come true but not all the time. Im going to tell you all the reason why!

Imagination is a whole new world, not many people can say that. You can create anything just by using ur brain.

In your mind think of scary movie, funny movie, and horror thing that can scare you. Sometime you can make up a plan by using ur imagination; Meanwhile, you can use ur Imagination for homework or any problem that you have at home. Think about it, you are goiign to love it.

Albert Einstein is one of the smartest people if you don't belive me read an article about him trust me. If you use your knowledge what the fun on that you can't even create nothing. Some people just say, use your knowledge for a problem instead of your imagination. knowledge is important but using your imagination is more important.

If you don't belive me belive Albert Einstien!

What would you like to use more your knowldge or your Imagination. Well think of the fun thing you can do with your Imagination. Well Albert Einstein would not have said, using your imagination is more important then knowledge. This is my opiaion but it could be your opiaion to. You need to try it, Im telling you it's so fun.

Imagination is really fun and helpfull in life; However not many people think that, Imagination fun because they never try it. Many people might think it boring and that there no point to it. But there wrong becuase how do you think that many people got out of there bubble or problem they had in school or home. Just use your imagination It might even help you in life or anywhere. Like I said this is just my opiaion no one else."
2688,C656A870B2B7,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school.

First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses.

Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate. This program is making students to rush. But if they fail any classes that make students add more classes to they last year and all this make student to no joy they last year in high school. In conclusion, Last year for students don't have to be the worse year.

In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they don't do nothing. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year. In conclusion, student need a four year of high school for they can get anything what they have to be done.

In conclusion, put this program in school is a bad idea because make students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. Because when students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting and student are not joy in they last year of high school. In conclusion, make high schools just three year to students is not enough time for students to be ready and plan their future."

Hi! Mister Generic_Name i'm writing this for you about never to be idle the peolpe who don'nm like to do nothing people that they are lazy , this it's important that the peolple that are lazy they should learn abot that like What they can do for don't be lazy ? What are the disadvantage and others benefit that could help them.

This position take care to all the people that don't like to do nothing with specifics ways some pelople have differents things that could be like lazy like , Many students are lazy to do their homework people that are lazy to work and they have to do it because it's necesssary for our life , Also the peolpe who have that study in university they like more go to a party people like that only want go to places that are funny or sleep the whole day in many countries people still with that the people who have a dream in their lifes and not strive to do it now who have opportunities that are young can strive for they want for their lifes in their futures , about the information that we can find it in Google about this topic also is a procedure that they can take to have energy I think also could be anemia and they could eat well .

Anothers examples that can help to people that should know them: Can be idle their whole life if they don't take care what they have or how they be : In centro America many cases are similar or could be like this , Also the children growing only playing with what they like example : soccer , video games , car , playing with their computers , etc.

2174,A263E403FAC3,"it's a gtood idea for us the students, like that we could know what we want to study when we be graduated from the high school. we have a lot of time to think about it. I would like to study for pilot, so i can try to choose one class to be related about that and learn about how to drive an airplane.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students don't have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think that's the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but it's not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school.

Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early.

the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too.

in others words if you don't have a good grades you can't sign for that schools.

You needed be prepare every time, If you do, You can study in the best university and achieve your dreams."
1476,722C353F2831,"I agree with being honest because holding the truth for so long can hurt a persons feeling wether you know them for long. Being honest is a good choice because it is over to get easily without lying and worrying about it later on about it and what you did. Lying about something you did do could get you to make the person believe that they aren't your friend or aren't special to you but telling to truth means that they can also tell honesty and how loyal you are.

Lying would make it hard for you in your life (future) and the people who care a lot for you because they wouldn't trust you ever again or talk to you. It'll make it harder for you to communicate with them when you see them or try to talk. Later on your life lying would make you regret what you did and why you did it because you'll lose someone in your life as well as the person you love.

Being honest with you family and friends would be the best choice because later on your life you dont have worry about any regrets on your actions on what you did. "
240,11DD0B26B584,"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time they're working.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school it's hard. They are falling asleep in class and they don't want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime.

Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and that's what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldn't happen.

In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they don't have to wake up early every morning.

In conclusion,schools should provide classes online because colleges,universities also provide them and most of the people who have taken them have been successful from their classes. That is the best thing schools could do for the students."
3145,DDD1A1F08FDF,"Identify a talent or skill you have, when you have a talent you can show it to people. Like share what you have when other people don't have what you have like if your gifted. Talents is not so it could be hidden in you it is to shown the whole world what you have that is amazing or imprresive. Do something you have that will make you trend around the internet or something rare in your body thats's cool and rare, you can even be a very populor person if you show the world these would be examples Sing,Dance,Magic tricks,Card tricks or even things that people haven't even done.

No one in the world is going to khown what you have if you don't share it with everyone. What would be the point to have a very cool or special talent if your going to hide it or not show it to everyone. This can be an opprotinity to amaze the whole world so go out there and share your talent."
2874,D06951B19A28,"Most people believe that working in a group is more beneficial than working alone. Other people think otherwise, they say that working alone is more beneficial than working in a group. People is different, they have different believes and ways to work.

Some people prefer working in a group for many reasons. One of that reasons is that people in a group get more things done in less time. They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored or you don't get motivated as the people that works in groups. Working in a group is better because people can share their ideas with the other people in the group and they can do a very good work using all those ideas. Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and that's fair, in that way everybody have the same amount of work to do.

Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. First, it is a little bit boring because they don't have nobody to talk and to share their ideas but they know what they are going to work with. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct. Third, people can edit their work many times without asking other people what they think about it. Another reason is that people does not have other people rushing them. And sometimes people that work in groups have a lot of issues because they do not agree with other people work, and a lot of times the grade that they got for that work is the same for every group member. That means that if somebody made a mistake every group member will be affected because of that.

In conclusion, working alone is more beneficial because of a lot of reasons. Every person have their own way to work but if you work alone you are not allowed to get in issues, arguments, problems and bad grades.  "

1410,6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over another's person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are.

I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media.

Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.

I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion people's actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others.

Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do. It is like when someone ask a child, "" what do you want to be when you become an adult"".            "
2123,9ED1E2DB0B0F,"If someone wants to grow more as a person, they will have to try different things. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future.

an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia.

Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person.

I also like to thing that I'm a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. I'm a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that I'm having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student

.

People can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his life's. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his life's. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered.

people have to do different things in their life's if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they don't have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person. He will has to try different things to get more experience and more knowledge.    "
2969,D5588B5DD6FF,"Once The great artist Michelangelo said that

""The grater danger for most of us lies not only setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"". I personally disagree with this because not all of us people really wants to more than what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Some people may say that this may agree with Michelangelo's said, because sometimes getting out of our comfort zone it is what most of us should do; challenge our selves to get even higher expectation and results, but to be realistic not all of us aims for that.

First of all, most of us do not really wants to do more than it is asked to do. For example, Generic_Name a orange contractor, he has been asked from his boss to fill 10 trailers of orange per day, one day he filled 12 trailers of oranges and thought that his boss would pay him the 2 trailers extra of orange that Generic_Name and his worker filled, in his paycheck did not appear the 2 extra trailers of orange causing Generic_Name pay his workers for the extra hours and work that they had putted, Generic_Name never again did more of he was asked to do. People took Generic_Name as en example of not doing more of what it is asked to do in their jobs.

Secondly, what really matters in this life is to achieve your goal. For example Generic_Name is a student from Generic_School, Generic_Name and his friends in their freshman year aimed for the advanced diploma in his school, but Generic_Name aimed for the standard diploma, his friends bought that by choosing the advanced diploma would be easier to earn credits and graduate faster, but little did they know they would get challenging classes, having almost AP classes in almost every material, Generic_Name from the other side having his standard diploma resulted him having normal classes and passing almost all of them. At their junior year Generic_Name's friends decided to change their diplomas because their classes was so difficult that their credits was not high enough, Generic_Name had the needed credits to be considered a graduate. Sometimes it is better to achieve your goal and do not try to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself because at the end what really matter in this life it is to achieve your goal.

Lastly, aiming low is a representation of honesty, and humility. For example, Generic_Name have a Mexican restaurant, she does not aspire her restaurant to be the greatest in her town, but what she really aspires for her restaurant is to keep her with the same love and passion she has for cooking and the satisfaction of her clients. Aiming low does not mean that is going to be a failure, but if you do it with honesty and humility, the 'danger' will not be as big as it appears.

As you can see, Michelangelo's said its not all the way truth because, people from all over the world thinks differently, having different experiences in their lives causing them to disagree on his said. Not all the people wants to more what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Not always setting our aim too high and falling short it is what it means to survive in this world."
2806,CD1D7EC5810C,"It has been asked by one teacher about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Work is the ability to do something that given by any one it can be a person, a company or at school that we do it by ourselves or with group. One scientist said that, ""one country can developed not by the Prime minister(President) its by working together"". Although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work.

Some people says that working alone is more beneficial than working in group because they learn how to accomplish things by themselves. In our world almost all people struggle to accomplish their work by their own, which is good to learn many challenging things in our work. For example, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb with out asking for help, he also fail many times to passing light through in the bulb. Also Leonardo Davinci took him more than a year to draw the most expensive and beautiful woman Monaliza, but he didn't ask anyone to help him. We can do any thing by ourselves if we work hard and struggle not to fail.

Actually Working with group is more beneficial than working alone because more ideas flow out from another person. In Biology our nerve system can stuck when we thing over and get stressed, the last level of stress is stuck. One person can do one or two things but if another person help him they can have more ideas. For instance, the two brothers who made the airplane, now a days we can see what kind of airplane made. However because of they are two they mix their idea and get it done.

Time is short in this world. God gave as the time interval to do in our inter life. Bible says God gave 900 years for Adam, and when the people become a lot the time interval became more less, and now a days the interval for our age(time) is 80 or 90 in average. When I came to my idea, it is limited by shorten time to complete the work when we working with group. Lets give an example for this; the teacher gave an assignment for each student to do research about global warming, he gave 1 month to submit it, but if they had work in a group they can easily do it with in less than a month. In this world we stay for shorten time interval we can work together to accomplish our goal.

although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work. "
2913,D242BBCBEAFB,"Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it. It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. There could be some reasons for them.

1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can apply online.

3. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

In conclusion, it could be able to work for the home-schoolers to also have an education because they did not go to public but have it at home."
1771,861349CA778E,"The reason why the school board shouldn't add hours to school because students already go to school to much and they would like more time off of school so they can do their homework, hangout with their friends, play sports out of school, and get more time to do their chores around the house.

The school board shouldn't add more hours because if students have appointments then they will have to put a later time but if the place of their appointment closes a little early then the students will have to leave school and that will make them have missing work, late work, more work to do at home with little amount of time, and more stress for the students to finish the work on time.

If the school board adds hours it will become a disaster for the students that have a job and need to get there in time also if they live far from their job their boss could get mad at them for being late and if they dont belive their worker they could get fired and then the student won't have a job, they won't get paid, and they won't have money to pay for what they need.

This is why the school board shouldn't add hours to school. "
3417,EAB299C6ECED,"First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she's very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right. Sometimes it is almost impossible for first impressions to change but its never to late it could come to the time it does."
3237,E218D28DBF0E,"Have you ever hurt someone feel before? There are some people want to be honest to there friends or family but there is other people don't want to be honest because there are sacred it might hurt them. People don't want to be honest to there friend because they might lose there friendship forever.

Will i disagree for being honest at all time. You don't have to be honest all the time it might hurt them but they need to know the true. For the person who have to tell them the true is hard for them because they don't know it might hurt there feels or might lose there friendship and maybe not forgive them.

Maybe there will be a point you have to tell the true to your friends and maybe there will not be a point to tall the true to them but sometime you have to honest. There will be a point that you have to tell the true like how you feel about them or what you don't like them if you don't like about them tell them the true be honest to them and if they don't want to be your friends so don't be then.

There are some friends don't like to hear the true from other. There are other do like to hear the true from other so they can be a good friends or a person. So you can trust them and feel like they are you friends but a good and a very fun friend you ever want to have and dream of having.

If you can't be honest to your friends don't said anything just be quit but just let you know there will be time you have to be honest but you don't be honest every time you can said the true. Be honesty sometime you can think about before you do it but think about good sometime be honest doesn't go will as you plane it. It can go bad but very bad but something it does go good."
1288,62E5030D1A59,"Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed."
861,421FA3CBFD5C,"The matter of always doing something is great. Some say if your to idle which means always hanging out or not doing much. Your not busy at any means your just wasting quality time, that could be used doing anything productive like getting important stuff done. At the end of the day the person that has acomplished the most has a better chance of liveing better, they dont have as much stress on thinking that they still have to get so much done but has not done anything.

The day i layed in my bed not doing anything was the day that i felt sorry for my self that i couldn't get up and do something simple ass get simple chours done like feed the animals or put to wash my clothes. Than I realized the next day when i went to sleep earlier the night before, I woke up with a better out look of the day i got stuff done and had extra time, to do what i like. In my free time I enjoy working with vehicles, change oil and all the main fuctions of a car.

I stay busy to a point for example i don't wanna stay up all night doing something that is not worth the time. They are people i know that work from 10 hours up to 14 hours a day, it's not a office it's outside mannual labor it's not fun. They still get home and do what is needed. That shows there is always time to do what's needed. If the type of person that works 8 hour shift's you have plenty of time to be productive and get something good done.

It's been shown by sciencetist that human that does the most each and every day, are likely to live longer. The reason is your not dealing with all that stress of getting things done. "
3102,DBDBF971510B,"It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit.

In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.

Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just won't show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes.

Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits.

In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to. "
2178,A2BA5F95C077,"Why high school school students should not take school programs that allow to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years .Students who take this program most take class after school , summer time or they not allow to take elective courses .Consequently students who take this program have less time to do homework, spend time with family or friends, enjoy the summer time or they not allow to take important elective classes like, foreign language, nutrition, music classes, computer skill class, or HPE.

Also students who take this program they could take classes for the same subject like, English nine and English teen at the same year. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early. But students who take this program are more exposed to fail or give up for the rush time that is in the programs and regular school years don`t have that problem. In conclusion thats why high school students should take early graduation program. "
2829,CE214B0C2CB6,"The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock once wrote, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it

In my opinion, we do choose who we want to be. I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently.

Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with. We choose who we want to become. People have their own dreams and choose their own path.

We choose our own paths. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didnt wanted to go because I new it was bad. For some people it is just fun and dont think about the consequences. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently.

We were all raised differently. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. There could be two sisters being raised the same but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be.

We choose who we want to be. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see everyday and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else. We do choose who we are because not everyone thinks the same, we choose our destiny, and parents raise their children with different habits and knowledge."

I know that us student are responsible for our grades in school but a B average just to play sports or be i some sort of activity is pretty dumb most students have C averages if you change this policy you will have lots of mad parents or students i think you don't want to be the bad guy here. I think and i think i speak for the whole school we at least should have a D average because if you really want to play in a sport or do an activity you should keep your grades up above an F that way you passing you class or classes but you also know that its not all fun and games you have to do your studies first in order to be in any type of activity and if you do good in school you can accomplish anything in life. I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community."

I'll say the policy #1 because student its a good rule that student can only use there cell phone during the lunch and other free time so that the student can do something that make them fun during lunch time. its also good because student uses there phone to call there parent to pick them up or they forgot something on there house he or she can just call there parent to bring it to school.

Bring cell phone in school is important because cell phone is not just for texting its also for emergency for your parent if you need something or you have to go somewhere after school. you can also call and tell them that don't pick me up because I'm going to my friend house and i call you when you have to pick me up.

3347,E7A76C48340D,"I think this council is debating the adoption. If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. the council said the teenagers don't have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. that's mean is breaking the law. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car that's why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers don't break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I don't have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and don't look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesn't want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people. And also I was have my friend was in street at 1 a. m. and someone was drank and hit my friend by the car. And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed. That's tells you how the world is not safe. a lot of people dead because of the people is drank or the someone have a gun or knife. if you search in internet about the people is succeed in their life the internet will show you these people focused in their future when they finish their work the going to their home to take a rest. try to make your schedule early like in the mid day in the morning to go to your home early.

a lot of people kidnapped every day make sure you're safe. And also I saw before a guy have a gun and he stopped a girl and his husband and he took from them the all gold that girl have it and he took the wallet from the man. and if you don't care about yourself no someone will care about you keep yourself safe. your life is expensive don't make your life is free for someone.

3077,DAD01CB5C8D8,"I'm not against having the after school homework club. I'm not against it because some people are failing their classes especially me and i would want to go to an after school homework club because one it would be helpful, two sometimes I forget that I have homework, and three sometimes I just want to get it over with and be done with the homework.

One of my reasons that I'm not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you don't know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I can't catch up to them and it's really difficult for me. Some of the students don't know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about.

My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but it's to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

My third reason is that some students don't do there homework because they forgot it at school or they don't remember they have homework. People like me don't like doing homework because it's really difficult and sometimes I need help doing my homework and it would help me have in my school a after school homework club because that would be helpful to me and other students."
2285,AADAFDCD9944,"Disagree about extending the school days two hour long and be a four day school week, the reason I disagree with this event is beacause if the school extend the day 2 hours can mess up the student schedule after school ends. The students may have to reschdule some of the things that may have to do after schools end and some student can't changed there schdule at all also more stress can happen to the students.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

More work may over stress the student mind and they might fall behind in things that might be inmported, the student may have less time to sleep to get work done on time beacuse there schdule maybe get more cramp with work to do, then they were before the school have added one more hour of school day. And the classes may have more work to do in class that can lead to more stress to the students and more homework to finish off at home.

Sure when students become an college students and adults they have more thing to do in there schudule then a student in high schools. But student do extra thing to get in to the college they want to get in to. I am trying to get in to a art college, so im going to an art schools for 5 hours to make my paforlio for it. I'm also making my essay and taking the sat to get into the art college I want to get in. Now lets add two hours for my school I have to reschdule my art school time then after art school I need to eat dinner then do my home work and I have little to no sleep trying to get my homework done in time for the next day."

To be yourself in a world is the greatest accomplishment because every person have a great dream to achieve on the life or every people take a great decision by to realize a great things.

First, every person have a great dream to achieve on the life. For example: A student have a plan to realize a job, but the student don not want to have friends by to finish the work. Another example: One boy is working in one project by the school, but the boy want to work alone, the boy said if he working with your partner never to finish the job.

Second, every people take a great decision by to realize a great thing. For example: On boy is playful and don not pay attention on the class, but the boy take a decision of no more play, and the boy start study and he is so happy because he has a great qualification. Another example: A teacher said at the students that working together buy one student take a decision not working together,

and the student that working alone he make a great job and the others not make nothing. All people have the opportunity to take a great decision because every people thinking different, and have a different dream.

701,35D50C79C5CB,"Studies have shown that one way to improve student achivement is to start an afterschool homework club. Teachers and Students volunteer to meet those who either have difficulty in certain subjects or who want to finish their homework early.

My opinion is that I find it a good idea to have a homework club, because when I was in 4th grade I went to a homework club and what I did there was of course work on homework but if you finished early you could finish work from later on that day or on things that you could do on the next day and I would always rremember I would be ahead on every paper she assigned to the class because I already completed it! When I didn't do homework club I would sometimes miss fun friday because during fun friday in order to play you must have all your work done and be caught up. But when I joined homework club I haven't missed one fun friday game!

In conclusion I suggestion having a homework club, it help with grades and getting ahead in class! It's also very fun"
1948,92FFB3530304,"I'm disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesn't had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before.

if you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. It well be hard, but not impossible. First impression can also have a large effect in someone's life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they don't want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it. It is not going to be easy, but that doesn't mean that it will be impossible. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them. They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyone's luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they haven't seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. Those who have negative impression can't reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. For most of the people changing their first impression looking impossible, because they are never going to try it, they never want to experience a new thing, or maybe most of them think that this is not that important, but, I think that first impression is also very important in life. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place.

I think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible. Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they don't want to reach your success.

In my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for. "
2216,A526E6F199BB,"Acutely yes, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. because if you are just idle you're not get anything done in your whole life and just sitting idle it's not going to help you see what you acutely need for your life, or your family life, or if you don't have a family think about your future.

They are people who don't have the life as you do. they wish and dream to have a better life to do what they want to do the things they wish to but you already have a live and everything you need in your life so dream big and make it come true. don't just sit idle and do nothing

Think about what you going to do. like some students say that they just want to be a famous ,if you want to a famous or important you better do something in your life, the other famous people did something they weren't idle in fact they spend their time just to tell us to do something in our life. like if you want to be a doctor you have to study for your dreams to be what ever you wanted to be. being a idle it's not going tho help you you life depends on you and your ideas. if you have dreams

Life needs energy to do something imagine you have a good ideas about doing a project in engineering and you designed really impressive, and the teacher like it and you entered the engineering science.

years later you found a good job in your career and you you have money, that make everyone proud about what you just did in your life and your family are thankful to you.

Life needs you and your ideas to prove yourself don't sit and do nothing and wast your time playing around

. because if you are just idle and doing nothing that doesn't make any since you have to do what ever you want to do it's your life no noes life your own life fight for it and go crazy for if and never give up says I con't do this and it's possible yes you can. trust yourself and ideas that's make your life easier to you.

1326,65B1F548E8BE,"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager. As a result, Do you think it will help student's in the future?"

To start with, the way I started to do the same things like him was because he got good grades. After that, started to think about my grades and his grade and I felt bad because my grades were bad. That's one way Generic_Name shared him wisdom with me.

Secondly, He was nice to me when I didn't know him so I was begin to nice to everyone. Then, teachers liked how I became nice and sweet. Another reason why to be nice is because you will want to treat someone the way you want to be treated.

Third, Generic_Name made me feel like a new person. You can make new friends like that too I made six new friends because I became nice. Teachers are nice back if your nice and let them teach the class so think about it and be nice to everyone.

Advice is something you seek, and search you can ask advice on anything it can be advice for you hair, advice for you dog, doctor advice you can partially ask advice on anything. When people are searching for advice they usually ask more than one person, I think thats best, because you can see from different points of views. I think only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice, another positive thing about asking advice is you can also learn something new or meet someone new.

Asking multiple people is better than asking one person for advice, because only asking one person may not get you the advice that is best needed. Asking multiple people for advice is something that can help you find a quicker solution. There are many positive sides when asking people for advice, like having different points of views that can give you tons of ideas and information for the advice that you are looking for. When you are gathering all these opinions you can discover new information and the advice you are looking for.

There are many positive sides when asking multiple for people advice. When you ask people for advice it could be a stranger, a family member, a friend. Entire way you are communicating with others and you can make friends while asking the for the advice you are looking for. You can learn new things about you friends, and family members, when you ask them for advice . You can also meet someone new and develop communicating skills.

When you ask for advice its best to ask more than one person. I think that it a good idea to see from different points of views and asking multiple people because, you discover different opinions and ideas. Only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice.

422,200671752EE0,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Yes we accomplish more if were always doing something but only if what we're doing benefits us. Why? Because if we're always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isn't benefiting your future then there's no point of doing something that doesn't help you out for later on in life.

For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if you're great at playing the sport. And also it's another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example.

Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then that's another great thing to do that'll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active it's going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you won't have that many health problems or issues with your body so you'll always stay fit. What'll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so that's something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future.

Also working is something you could always do that'll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means you'll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. It'll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you won't just be home doing anything.

So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I don't believe inactivity serves a purpose because you won't accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you won't be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future. So yes, we accomplish more if we are always doing something."
2821,CDCE16D2C836,"Boom that's the sound of a volcano that just erupted. An enjoybale educational activity for me is a volcano because they are intresting and an excellent science expirement.

The first reason I like volcanoes as an eductaion activity is because they are intresting. I've always wandered what caused a volcano to explode. Now I don't need to because I know now what causes them to erupt so voliently. Valcanoes are very fascinating to watch erupt when you see the magma flowing down. The magma can be so hot it can be like being hit with a ray from the sun. It's very awesome how the volcanoes are fromed and made. But as cool as volcanoes are they can still be pretty dangerous,because they could cause harm and erupt,cause chaos. sometimes volcanoes erupt at random times. Sometimes in villages or islands and in this case people don't have time to run. Because the magma flowing down is like an avalanche because it goes really fast and the people can't outrun the magma because it is to fast. There have been more volcanic eruptions that have killed people even children. Like pompei which was a huge volcanic eruptionthat killed a lot of people. After the eruption paremedics and police went back to discover the remains of people under huge rocks. Volcanoes are very intresting althougj they can be dangerous at times it's amazing how it looks when it erupts. Volcanoes are one of the greates things to study.

Next a volcano would make agreat science project. A volcano is a good science fair project. Because it's very amusing to see how the volcano erupts. When it erupts you can see the hot flowig magma as if people on a raft were going down. Volcanoes are a good science roject because it lets you know more about volcanoes and how thy come to form. Volcanoes are very rare to find here where I live at but there are still some outhere. That's a good science project not only because they explode but because you can even show the layers. Volcanoes have layers the top the middle and the bottom. The top is where the magma shoots out like a bullet from a rail gun. The middle is the less calm part and the bottom is where all the magam is. That is why I think a volcano is a good science project.

In conclusion an enjoyable educational activity is the science project of a volcano and i gave my two reasons why a volcano is a good educational activity. What is en enjoable educational activity for you?"
242,11E9348F5072,"In this prompt we are going to talk,and choose if we accomplish more by doing more things in the world,or does inactivity also serve a purpose or not. We all have a different opinion when it comes to things like this choosing between something different. Well we actually do accomplish more if we do more things for an example say someone wants to become a doctor we go to collage, we do things,and we learn, after doing all that we all accomplish something because we all did something to succeed what we love. Therefore a reason why doing more makes a person accomplish something is because doing more,and learning more teaches someone things they never learned before. So by that we mean that once a person learns something they have never done before they start loving it and start doing it. Other reasons and examples why doing more is better is because when the person does more they have all the energy to do it which is honestly a good thing because once a person learns something that person just wants to go to collage,graduate, and succeed which is something we all want. Here is an example why it is that we study a lot and try to learn things it is because we want to grow up,succeed on what we love doing,and also to accomplish new things we have always wanted to try. When you start learning new things,and get the hang of it all everything will just become easier for someone,and also things they always wanted to do will just become easier for that person too. Another thing is that when we keep doing things it will just be done faster like it said in the prompt something Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" which is honestly facts we do get things done faster if we just keep doing it, if we just keep trying without stopping, and i mean yes taking breaks on important things is good because we all do need breaks at some point to be honest but also getting things done is better and once someone gets things done they feel really proud of themselves, all of us do because it is a good feeling to finish things that were hard,and stressful. Another good feeling is having nothing to do when you are accomplishing things,and succeeding too."
1695,80D2FE30F665,"Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons.

First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.

Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding,

or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.

Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.

From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

Thank you."
3797,FAF2897C9B65,"I agree with Winston Churchill that success consits and failing many times.

One reason is that if you fail, that is going to make stronger for the next time. It's like a game; you are going to do whaterver it takes to gain the game. If you do not do it in the first round, it's going to be the second and you'll do even better. A lots of people think that if they don't do it in the first time, that's going to be it. They don't realize that if they just keep going they're going to get there, and be success. Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to fail? but that's how it's some times. We have to accept it and keep trying. Life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want.

Another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, that's the most important reason of all of this. if we don't have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all. For example, I used to have this friend that his mom wanted him to be a doctor, but he didn't want to be a doctor. He wanted to be a teacher. Farthermore, he study to be a doctor. He wasn't that good but that was what his mom wanted. The second year, which was even harder he just stop. He talked to his mom saying that was not for him. He did not have any enthusiasm on that career, so he fanilly started classes to become a teacher. now, that was for him. He did so much better, good grades and excellents jobs. In short, he never lost the enthusiasm to be a what he wanted.

Some people migth say that you don't have to fail, that you have to be success all the time. They migth say that is not ok to fail. However, that's not true, you can fail it's going to make you strong. you are going to have experience and you're going to do things so much better. If you can't do it in the first then, go for the next, and next until you can finally make it.

In summary, success consist and failing many times."
70,053C05D2EE43,"Why Collage is Important

Acorting to CNN weekly 98.5% of people that go to collage get five times more income then people that dont go to collage. One reason you should go to collage is because you can be more finachely sexesfull another reason why collage is a good chose is because you can learn new things and meet new people.

Students can get help in a homework club easily. One way they can get help is by asking a teacher for help. Another way a student can get help is asking a friend for help. They can get help with a teacher and a friend. This is how students can get help easily.

Students can finish there work at school. When they finish there work at school they got more time to do whatever they want. They could play games. They could read a book. they could take frequent naps. In conclusion people can do more things when there done with there work.

2067,9B69DE203555,"When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice.

It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently.

When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says.

People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours.

You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life. It can help build stronger relationships and people can trust you. Trust is very important because people can talk to you about anything and you will know how to react and what to say.

In conclusion, talking to more than one person to ask them for advice can help you make the better choice. It can also help you out with other situations later in life.

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.

attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.

When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me.

I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classroom's we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it.

The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings.

Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more.

In my opinion for the students who prefer to attend school classroom's it's good decision, because they will have more infermations and more experience about the way to make a plan and more knowledge about the courses you taking at school.

I think students would not benifit from being able to attend classes from home.                                             "

Schools should extend time by two hours because students will have more time to do there class work. If a students have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework. Having more time in school means that you can get your work done and have extra time to do othere class work. In my old school we only had seven hours of school and we have eight classes in a day. most of the time we barley had time to finish ower class work so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, expirement, and project. Thats why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to explane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to explane things to a students and help them under stand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teacheres did not have time to explane things to students. Students only went to school, tooke notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there home work becauses it was to much. At the end of the movei students had took an exam and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up ninde persont of the students did not finished so they automaticly failed. if only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam. Another reason would be that having more time can help students is that scientists prove that having more time added in a school schedual will help students incress there acidemic by ten persont. That means if i spend more time in school learning i will be come smarter then students with a regular schedual. Having more can help students finish work they would not normaly finish when they have a regular schedual."

2493,B983F2965167,"Influencing other with positive qualities by expressing action or even he way how we talk, is the best and only way to represent your character. I strongly agree with Albert Schweitzer, a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. Because it represents your positive qualities and as well as culture, and help others understand more about you.

One reason that people should behave positively, is that they can represent them selves to others. As an example, people with positive behave draw others' attention by the way how they physically act and speak. They are easy to convince, open to everyone, and humble. In my real life experience, I have met a lot of these kind of people who I consider as friends now.

I was influenced by them the first time we met, with their positive attitude and respect.

Another reason why reason that people should behave positively, is that they can influence others by their culture. In my real life experience, I have who drew my attention by the way how they interact to others and I wanted to know and learn more about his culture and religion.

Well I can imagine that and just imagining that makes my head hurt.

Just having to come for 8-9 months of school is hard for some students and I would think that less number of students would come to school if we had a year-round school. Just having a normal school year(8-9 months)is amazing. Although some people say that having a year-round school is a amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year, actually having a year-round school is not a great idea because students would have less stress about school and also students would try harder when they come back from summer break.

Also because students would come back after 3-4 weeks and still remember.

Having a year-round school would give students more time to learn all the material they have to know and more easy and faster. also have more opportunity to get better grades because you are more time in school. I read in a article that it said that the more time you spend in school and focus the better it is for you in the future. Having a year-round school has advantages and disadvantages such as being more time in school,less time being out of school, maybe less school activities, less summer time , etc.

Many things can change when the school changes. is always better to keep the old way than start a new way and not be successful.

I think that not having a year-round school is a good idea because students would have less stress about school.

Students wont be as stress because of school the whole year and only a little bit of vacation. Stress can be something bad not just for students but for everyone. Stress causes illness such as your head hurts,back hurts, feel like not doing anything, etc. Not having a system of school like that can give students more time for vacation alone or with the family. Having a 3-4 moths of summer vacation is enough for you to have a really nice vacation with family or like I said before alone. school causes a lot stress for students and having to come all year is more stressful. enjoying your summer is not just about one week or two is about having time for yourself and family.

also not having a year-round school would make students try more for the next year that they come back to school.

When students have more time off school it makes them want to come back. Students want to come back and start the year. Some of them get so tired of being at home that they just want to come back. Also being on regular school break students enjoy more the summer than just 1 month or less. They have more opportunity to go explore the world and everything. Much more freedom for the summer. When is summer students cant wait to leave school but when its like 2 months out of school they want to come back. Summer is the best season for a student because is when they enjoy most of there time with the family,friends and having fun in the summer is the best memories and maybe the best memories they have with friends and family. My best memories are the ones in summer that I enjoy mostly with my family.

In conclusion, some people say that having a year-round school is great because that way students wont forget what they had learned over the year but I think that having a year-around is not a good idea because students would feel more fatigue than the usual and also when they come back to school they would feel more comfortable and ready to learn more again.

Being out of school is a great thing but when you are almost done with summer you just want to go back to school and see your friends and than is the same thing when you are going to summer you feel so excited that you just want to be done and not come back but is the same feeling when you are coming back from summer to start the year. Having pretty experiences and sharing time with the family is amazing that is what makes summer amazing. wouldnt you want to have your children with you in summer vacation? "
1150,591164D3C800,"I agree with Albert Schweitzer "" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is he only thing."" Setting a example to others it's the best way to influence others because for example there are two students named Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Both of them are in the same school. Generic_Name has good grades he is always doing his school work, never dose anything to upset the teachers or get in terable while Generic_Name is the complet opposite.

Generic_Name has poor grades, always talking back to his teachers and never dose his school work he also get in to fights with other students. Generic_Name has a idea he wants to help Generic_Name to become a better person and influence him to do well in school. Generic_Name have the same first block class as Generic_Name. Generic_Name decided to get bad grades and talk back to his teachers.

Generic_Name is doing all of this because he wants Generic_Name to realize just because you have bad grades in school that dose not mean you can not change that. The next day Generic_Name gets good grade he apolegize to his teachers and Generic_Name seas Generic_Name having bad geades and the next day Generic_Name change that and started doing good agine. Generic_Name thinks to him self if Generic_Name can change so can I. The first thing he dose is to go and apolagize to his teachers for being rude he started studing, getting good grades. The moral of this was that some one's behavior could have a influence on others this is why I agree with Albert Schweitzer."

Keeping a positive attitude is good because you'll accomplish more things in life and you can build your trust with others. In addition, they way your attitude is can determine your personality.

The importance of attitude is and will always matter to people. For example, when you keep a positive mind set on accomplishing something, you'll achieve it. Therefor, having a positive attitude can help you in ways that you can't image. For example, it can help you build your trust with friends and family. To conclude, there are things in life you can't change such as first impression, but having a positive attitude toward people can have an impact on them.

In conclusion, being able to accomplish more and building your trust are the keys success in life. Positive attitude is also the key to success in life, some people will disagree with this statement.

1697,80DD7EE85BF7,"I disagree for adding one and a half of hour in school days. Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing and we get tired and it's just to much forus kid's or grown ups.

Reason #2 is you don't have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins.

For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you can't go outside cause it's to dark and your parents won't let you cause of hours of school. That's reason #2.

Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish. For example you come out of school at 4:00 your tired but you got homework and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hoursof extra work but you can't do anything really fun like go out somewhere with freinds cause it's to late and dark. That's reason #3.

Reason #4 is a appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00 but you can't go cause you got extra hours in school i know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. That's reason #4.

I get it if yall school's set extra time in school just to make us smart,or have a good life,and a good job,but us kid's and adult's need time for are own self so this is all my reason and example's that I disagree for having extra time in school. "

1846,8B095EB24288,"Students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because some students have to work, they have family, and others live far away.

First of all students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because some have to work and they dont have time to attend to school because of their schedule.

Second reason is that students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because they have family, that could be a problem for them since they could have kids and have to take care of them and being able to study from their houses it's a great a option for them.

And last reason, because others live far away. sometimes students dont have transportation because of their location or maybe they don't even have school in the area, and online classes it's an good advantage for them and good opportunity to study.

In conclusion online courses have many great opportunities and good advantage for students, and some of the reasons are: because some students have to work, they have family, and others live to far away."
1505,73D2B941F40F,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. School should allow students to decide if they wanna attend at their school, home, or both. Anyways it's a good idea that some school allow their kids to attend classes from their own house.

Allowing students to attend classes from school is good idea. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Most kids either play sports, have a job, or maybe both. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.

If we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.

It wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. some students are just too lazy. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.

I hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!"
3193,E0656353B8F2,"School districts shouldn't give the three year instead of four year program. Why? because students should receive all the education they need to succeed everything they want with completing four years of high school. Most colleges look for students that have completed four years of their high school education, also they don't like when students have free periods unless they have a specific reason of requesting free courses. Students will always have time to do what are they want in life with a four year high diploma it doesn't matter if your birthday is late and you want to graduate with three years because you don't wanna graduate at that specific age. Teachers, parents,siblings, they should be the ones telling they're children or young adult that it is important to complete there four years of high school. The process you have to follow to do a three year of high school is more stressful because you have to summer school or evening school where there are not really a lot of teachers to help out with most of the stuff you need help with. When your in school you have English, history, science, mathematics teachers, you have counselors librarians everyone that can help you with anything you need to finish high school. Most students may graduate early because they have an illness, disease, or something and they just can't take the pressure of being in school no more. From my point of view parents should always talk to there children about how important education is for them they can pursue all there dreams if the parent didn't have the opportunity to finish there high school career. Also entering college early wouldn't be so convenient because maybe the student missed something they didn't learn then when they get to college there like my teacher didn't teach me this or I don't know what that is. The work force accepts a lot of young teenage children that graduate from high school and expect them to have a high school diploma and of course they'll have a high school diploma but they wont know how many years they completed which I believe still shouldn't be accepted. Children think that just because they have a high school diploma they're better then everyone else if you only completed three years you shouldn't feel superior to everyone else. I would feel disappointed in myself for not completing all the four years I needed because I would feel like I didn't complete everything I need to be the most intelligent most outgoing person I am. If your a child that believes you can't do it and finish high school because it's stressful, of course you can do it I punish myself all the time for saying that. I may not be the most smartest person in my family but i'm giving it my all to complete my high school career as an older sister and role model of two younger siblings that I have. Also if your a three year completer you should always take younger siblings in to consideration because they look up to you and they are gonna think that just by completing three years its OK. To be someone successful in life finish all four years of your high school education schools shouldn't provide three year programs for students or at the age of eighteen they can drop out they are going to get no job no one will accept them without an education. There is nothing good out in the world without an education or some type of proof that you have completed or have gone to school. In conclusion, to all of this children, teenagers, anyone take in mind that colleges, jobs, anything will most likely look for a four year completer because if they see you as a three year completer they'll take the other person instead of you. Even if you have all the requirements you needed to complete high school you still really didn't finish your career. Schools should stop providing this program and make students complete there four years in high school because it is very important for them to get an education till they are 18 and they are free to make their own decisions if they want to drop or just do three years of high school. And don't be the type of person to just finish high school with three years and do nothing after you have decided to not finish school you just decide to drop out to be home and do nothing for yourself. Be the bigger person and take full responsibility of your education because you only have yourself throughout your journey in high school there will be no friends once it comes down to your senior year in high school. The more you pressure your self to finish high school the more stressful and painful it'll be for yourself because you may not have all the requirements completed and you have to complete them in summer school thats why parents and teachers mentors anyone should always come in and talk to the child and make them finish what they have left of there high school career nothing is impossible. Do what you can to complete and finish high school with all your four years and you'll be the most hard working work force person ever or the best and college student that completed all four years and will complete all her college years needed to succeed to accomplish there dreams or whatever they want to do."
2510,BA9DA5122C58,"I think that we should have after school homework clubs in school because it can really help kids get homework done at the right time so they don't get a zero on their homework.

There is kids that get too much homework so homework club would be a good time for them to get their work done so fast that they don't need to worry about it when they get home. Some kids might struggle in one class because they have a lot of assignments that they need to make up. Homework club will give students plenty of time to get missing work done, and they should move the grade up to an A or B. You could also get homework from a bunch of different classes, and homework club will give them enough time to get the easy assignments done, so that they can focus on getting a hard assignment done, and that would leave the students with one assignment left to do.

Homework club can be seen as a way to spend your time wisely when it comes to getting homework done. It reduces the stress of getting too much homework because students will realize how much time that they have to get their work done so they can focus on the activities that they do in or outside of school.

For example, someone might have soccer practice at 5:30, and homework club might be from 2:30 to 4:50. That would give a student enough time to get a lot of work done before soccer practice. It's better to finish homework early because you would not need to worry about it for the rest of the week.

Sometimes kids need assistance from teachers because they are struggling to understand the subject, and they may need a teacher's help. The could stay at homework club so students can work with the teacher to get the work done. A student might leave an assignment at the last minute because they had other assignments to do. If homework club will give a student two hours in a half to do their assignment, they should be able to get their work done just in time. Homework club can give relief to a student when they have left an assignment at the last minute.

I believe that if a lot of kids went to homework club, then all students will be successful.

That would mean that kids will get As and Bs from now on, and they would not need to stress about their grades. It just takes students to use their time wisely at homework club to get homework done,

and no one will have any problems. "
1962,94131A88E955,"In my oppinon school is good how it is now. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school

This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow.

But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldn't have the studets as much. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.

This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks inbetween school days just so that they have months off on their summer break. "
2048,9A879E8D266F,"Dear Reader's

This statement is wrote by Ralp Waldo Emerson, it's trying to help to the peoples who's thinking about his life, if it's better work indibiduality?

3209,E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success.

First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn't actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class.

Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn't actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you're supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life.

Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you're losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal.

In conclusion, some people said that failure doesn't lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success."
1223,5EFD8FA4133A,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key of success. Some people think that having a positive attitude is not the key to success. That is comprehensible but not all the time. I strongly agree that having a positive attitude can walk you threw success. In my opinion I think having a positive attitude is the key of success because It make you feel confident on what you are doing.

First of all, a positive attitude would help you to achieve many things. For example, one time I was taking a Math test, I was not thinking positive, I thought I would failed that test and that's what happened. In addition, I had my chance to retake the test and I went with a positive mind and I did it, I pass my test. Positive attitude also helped me to not get stress because I was positive and I knew I would pass that test. Therefore, a positive attitude can help you in many ways. It make you think that you are going to pass every test even thought you haven't studied.

Second of all, with positive attitude you can achieve many of your goals. Another example, one time when I was trying to get a job I was thinking in a way that I said to myself that I would not get that job. At that time I said that I can do it, That I'm going to get that job because now I have a positive attitude. At that moment when I got that job I felt so happy and my new boss told me that she liked the way that I had a positive attitude and that I was capable for the job. This shows that, a positive attitude can lead you to success.

Third of all, some people say that having a positive attitude is not going to guide you to success. They say that even thought you think in a negative way or in a positive way you can still achieve many of your goals. But, when you think in a positive way, It make you feel better and confident on what you are doing, because when you think negatively you can feel depress or sad because you don't believe on your self. Also, It can make you feel that you are not capable to, and you would fail. Furthermore, a positive attitude can guide you and walk you threw success.

To conclude, a positive attitude can walk you threw success. You can achieve many things, many goals, etc. It help you to be confident while you are doing something that is hard. It also help you to believe on your self. For me there were many times that I was thinking negatively and I didn't achieve many things but now that I have a positive attitude I'm achieving many of my goals and it make me fell proud of me. Thats why we all have to have a positive attitude.

2374,B04F96DEDE6B,"Once someone told me,"" Focus on your goals, and keep focusing until you reach them, it does not matter if it takes long, at the end of the day it will worth it "". I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take.

One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time,

which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition.

But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best.

Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything. In any career, you have to know about everything, even if it is a little bit, but you will learn new interesting things every days, things that you did not know before, and your interest in those things will drive you to search more about it and make you feel that you wanna know more and more about anything you are learning. All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

In conclution, I think all students should have an idea of what career they wanna take, by the time they enter high school , so their courses of study in high school can help them when they are ready to go to the University, to not be difficult learn about it."
3286,E433745B3F87,"Michelangelo the artist once said,

'' The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark.'' I agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. However, there can be a better statement to explain this more. When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. It's like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that don't really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But there's people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. It's mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said '' The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot.'' Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they don't have any papers to work , don't understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind,

and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest people's that end up missing there shot. But there are other people's that won't let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesn't mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I don't think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us. For sure there's others statement that are more dangerous then this one."
76,05ACEDBB9CB4,"A lot of students become involved in extracurricular activities, and that makes them don't have time enough to finish their homework and assignments. Schools should control student's involvement in extracurricular activities, because sometimes students can't make their own decisions in the right way and that will makes them don't focus a lot on their studying and education.

My first reason that the schools should control students' involvement in extracurricular is the student can involve in a lot of activities after school or during the school time that can make him be late to do his homework and he will be tired to study; and that makes him have a bad grades and he wouldn't have a good future.

Secondly, when the schools control the student's involvement that make the student more successful in his classes and that give him the chance to finish all of his assignments on the time; also that makes him more understandable to what is happening in all of his classes.

The third reason that the school should control the students involvement is the student will know how to spend his time in a right way and saving his time to the important things that would help him in his future, and makes him more responsible about his education and future.

Lastly, if the schools control the students involvement in extracurricular activities, they would know how and when the student become involved and they would know if the students would have time to the activities or not.

That was the reasons about how the schools should control the students involvement in activities and how it is good for the student's education and future on the same time. Because students can't make their own decisions; sometimes they feel that somethings good for them but it is not, so they need someone more mature to show them the right ways and right things. "
2075,9C1A3F53B869,"Do you think that should be students finish high school in three years, enter college and get a job early? Some students, parents and teachers are agree with that the students finish the high school fast. I think the students should be finish high school in three years because, they will can graduate of the university more early, they will get a job fast and probably they will can do you're life better, to age early and be independents.

In this paper, I will argument that in my country El Salvador; The High school is of three years. My old sister was graduated of the high school at you're seventeen years old. she enter to the university and now she will graduate of nurse at you're twenty-one years old, however, I feel that is better that the high school should be of three years because, I'm in the high school and I will graduate at my nineteen years old. I think that, I will late to graduate for the university, more if I take a profession of eight years to studies.

In my school, the students, parents and teachers voted, to know how many are agree with that high school should be of three years. The 70% of the votes was the answers that yes, they are agree that the high school was three years. Some teachers says that, is a better way that the students will can have opportunity to graduate more fast, since that some students don't pass the class or the scholar years. They have the reason because, my brother don't pass the scholar years, now he need to repeat again the grade nine. He will take five years in the high school not four.

My mom was graduated too at you're seventeen years old in high school. When she was twenty-five years old, she graduated of doctor and then she got a good job in the hospital. In the same time she went to night school because, she want to be too heart's specialist and she was graduated again when she had 30 years and now she have two good job, have better life. I think that she can graduate early, because she only got three years en high school.

Three years in high school is better way to that the students can graduate early. Some school districts are disagree with that but, they are wrong because, the students will can have more fast a good job, if they going three years at high school. In the future I hope that the high schools will be of three years not four. "
2332,AD5621D2A958,"First impressions will always change bceuase you dont know the persons true color's yet. A lot of people act so nice on there job interview, but later on that first impression is going to change. On the first day of school teacher's act to nice but, later on in the school year the teahcer's first impression is going to change.

For example, when you first meet the person they act so friendly and so nice until you really get to know them, they start changing. you will see the persons true colors if they act the same and do what they first did when you met them. Finally, first impressions going to change because some people just act to do good on thier first impression.

For example, people dress and act good at there job interview. When they finally get that job, first impression is going to change because they are going to keep calling off and not work hard enough as they said in the interview. Finally, when the manager see's that you changed your first impression you will get fired.

For example, on the first day of school teacher's act so nice and tell you how the year i going to go. After that, the teacher's start getting tough on you and giving you more assignments. finally, its a proven fact that teacher's change thier first impression.

In conclusion, I agree that first impressions change because its a proven fact and anybody in this world can tell you first impressions change because you dont know there true colors."
1271,6186246910E1,"students should graduate in three years instead of four years.

It is better for students to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able tho help their families.

The first reason is that students will finish the career that they choose early. students will have 1 years less to graduate. For example, a student is planning to graduate in 2021 and start his career to finish it in 2026 but now that students will be allow to graduate 1 year early then the student will finish his career in 2025. It means that the students will reach their goals early. Students can reach a better life in less time working hard with positive mind.

The second reason is that students will be able to help their families. One year less make the difference. For example, a student's mother is really sick and the student have a part time job ,but he don't gain enough money to buy his mother medicines and he have to graduate but he is still in his third year of high school so he have one more year but now that he can graduate in three years he can receive his diploma and find a full job time to gain enough money to help his mother. It means that one year less can help you change the life of your family to better. One years less can brings chances for others.

Some people believe that students should not graduate in three years instead of four years. However, others including me believe that students should be allow to graduate in three years because students will finish the career that they choose early and they will be able to help their families.

3608,F3996EB91406,"I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because people in this world want you to be another person that yourself. I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be.

I start with my family; How i said my family they don't like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I don't want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they don't like to much, they don't like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment.

In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else.

That's why I'm agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people don't like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I don't think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who don't belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often."
1185,5C05D79FE75A,"Should people make their own decisions or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters?

In my opinion, I think that people should seek guidance form experts and authorities, for many reasons this solution has prove to be effective, if a person listens to other people opinions, then the decision the person makes will not be base only on his/her opinion.

First, lets say if a male person seek guidance from experts and authorities when taking a decision, it shows that he is obedient and he will not act recklessly when taking a decision about his life, it shows that he is willing to listen to other people perspectives.

Second, in my opinion i think that asking for guidance shows matureness, it shows that you care about yourself and others opinion, it also shows wiseness when you ask others for guidance first so you can decide and make the best decision.

In conclution, people should seek guidance from experts when taking a decision about their life, I think that if people set aside their pride and worries, we humans would make better choices not just for us but for our entire environment which it also includes other species."

I think that every students should perform and they should be required to perform community service. For example some children and others clean up litter.

But there are so many children who do not want to help other to get the job done .

69,053ACB9DFE74,"If your having so much trouble in a problem you have just ask an adult or some freinds. It would be good to have more then one person. Because a freind could be fake and give bad edvise like drink alcohal to feel better or cut your self becuase you are depresed. Nothing of that is good so when a good freind comes to tell you advise they tell you good things. Another thing is that maybe somone could be lieng to you about somthing. and some people try to help but somtimes they make it worst by givving you bad edives.

Like I said earlier somone might be lieng to you like for example he/she might say leave the house because your parents cause the problem. So you have to dectect that or els e you will get in seriuos problems. so i f you know that their is a fake freind trying to tell you lies say ok and leave.

Another thing i said is that they probably give you the best edvise. What i mean about that is that they try to help you but they only make it worst like for example: your bf (boyfreind) breakes up with you and you cry for hours and he says ask him to be your bf again you will be ambaresed in front of everyone the last point i wanted to talk about is that more than one person is good to give you advise because some of them can not be halpfull some of them can be liars and some of them can be fake edvise"
3863,FE4E3BB2DAE1,"People really work on this this? or People knows the importance to be better every day? People didn't know the importance to learn more, like give to their mind more wisdom and they just conform with small pieces and

I very agree with this statement because it's true that if you dont learn more than you already know, you don't be able to be successful in life and I was wrong all the time and it's sad for me just realize that I waste a lot of time doing nothing and this question makes think a lot and the reason why is because I never think about to do something much better that I did already and sometimes if I have to do it, Im afraid to fail or do something wrong but small things do the difference and know something more that you already do it gives you more opportunities in life and you grow more.

Try something new that you never done before it's something scary for humans it doesn't matter the age or how brave you are,

if you had a lot difficulties doing it; probably you will be scare if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, I been working in a Japanese restaurant about one year and half and it was the first time for me working as a server and I was scare to do it and the reason why I decide to do it was the money, and I got surprise of myself because I made it and my boss was telling me that I was doing really good job and I felt so proud of my self because at that time my English wan't perfect and after I'm got problems with him about money and it was too much problems, so I decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers so I went to apply but the problem was when I saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when I saw the menu in mind I was saying "" You will fail""

I feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that I made but I made it one more time and today I thinking all that I went through it was't that much difficult and I'm not a master but I'm still learning.

Many people are conformist with their life and dont want to learn more and unfortunelly I'm include in that group of people and it happens to me that I fail many times because

I think already know everything even more than others for example, One day I was taking a Spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is Spanish and I remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasn't and I fail the test because I saw questions that I never imagine that even exist and that was very important to get a credit so that day I learn that even if know many things is always good learn more.

In conclusion, you have to be better every day and know that is always more to learn every day, even if you know the stuff and always keep in your mind that try something new don't have to scare you because every human has the ability to learn and do the much that they want and the only obstacle you put it to your self.

2278,AA416CED237D,"I think some people might find visiting a national park enjoyable because it features better activities and it also attracts more people around the World for example the Grand Canyon or hiking mountains attracts lots of older people from all over the world every single year.

But others might like Community parks because there's not that many people like national parks, kids might find community parks more enjoyable because it provides a wide variety of things like Playgrounds, Soccer fields, Basketball courts, etc and its also free unlike national parks were you have to pay in order to get in.

I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing a sport like soccer, basketball etc, in a community park because you can can play there any time with friends and family it's also free, you can also meet new people in a park or you can also join a sports team like a soccer team and play it with your friends which can also lead to scholarships but in order to get that you must train and work hard then you might get in to teams bigger soccer team's and you might become a Professional player and join big teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or other soccer teams, that's what I like to do outdoors and I think other people should stop playing video games, social media, etc and try something new outdoors because it can change your future and life for ever and playing a sport can also help you meet new people travel places, meet soccer stars from all around the world like Spain, France, United Kingdom.

Sports are also good for your health running helps your heart, I also like watching soccer games I support Barcelona a team from Spain the reason why I support that team is because they have really good soccer player like Messi, Luis Suarez and Couthino and they also win trophies like the UEFA Champions League were all the European teams play every year to win the Championship.

also every 4 years there's the World Cup were every Nations soccer team plays to win the World cup.

In soccer if you are good at the sport and join a professional soccer team you can get paid up to more then one million! In conclusion who doesn't want to get paid one million dollars for playing an awesome sport and if youre a girl don't worry because there's also soccer teams for girls and they can also join big soccer teams and make money just like boys and it's also proven that people who play sports are healthier and have better muscles they also eat healthy foods and fruits and run train every day to burn out calories so that they be in shape when they play in their soccer team's and they why i think someone might find that enjoyable."
2250,A88BE59EEBAE,"when people ask for advice, sometimes seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by seeing if most peoples opinions are the same and its a good advice some opinions maybe better then others , you can also recave better advice from differnt people like your best friend can give you an advice that will help you lot but the other person that you dont really talk to that person doesnt really know how to help you like your best friend does , each opinion can help you with something different like some one may give you advice about a sport you may not need it right now but you could use it later in life so each opinion can help you later in life it may not help you never know , for example if you need advice on how to do better in school or how to get your grades up you would ask a teacher or your friends but someone else can give you bad advice or it doesnt helpe youor on how not to do well in school so its better to ask multiple peolpe then just one because you have a higher chance of getting good advice frome differnt people and you have more to opinions then just asking one persone beacse he may not have th best advice but he will try to help but you have a lower chand you can see wich helpe more and wich dont really dont helpe you would be getting good advice that will sadisfide you, so in my opinion asking multiple people for advice is better is a better chose then just asking one persone."

Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school.

There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example,

you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.

Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends

I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world. Not all teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feel like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home. "
2038,99A73BEA826C,"Students Need to Identify a Career

I am in 11th grade and I still thinking in what career should be better for me, if I could expected a career by the time I entered to High School, I could not being worry about what career should be better for me. I think that is a good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because in the four years that they are in high school they can get prepare in the career they want. By the time the students enter to college it will be much easier for them because they have already decided what career should be better for them.

There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. For example, I had one friend that he wanted to be a scientist, so when he was in high school he get prepared to a scientist, he started to look what he need be a scientist, he looked how many years he had to go to college, he found that science has a lot of math problems that he did not know and he started to learn math. The four years in high school can help you to get prepare in your the career you want.

Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them. If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose. There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life. That's why it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school or at least when they are still in high school.

In my opinion it's good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because if they could identify a career that they might think they would like, that could be a lot of helpful, because by the time they go to college they don't get stress because they don't have much time to decide what career could be better for them.

1519,74FF4379012C,"BEING YOURSELF.

Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally.

people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are.

The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her.

With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.           "
874,4351657CEC2F,"Do I agree with churchill""s statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? In my opinion I do agree with his statement because everyone fails at something in life. There's so many people that fail in the world and I definetly agree with churchill's statement because i think it really says a lot about life in general its not easy.

One reason is because I believe that everyone goes through some type of failure in life and I feel like that's the only way you learn from anything. I also think that people that fail are people that succeed at what they failed at. That's the only way you learn from anything for example people can fail at taking a test or playing a sport. Not everything people do the first means there gonna succeed which isn't always the case. I feel like when people fail that's when they can take the time and realize why they failed they learn from that mistake and the next time a oppurtunity comes for them to try again they can try there best and succeed. Trying your hardest is the best way to deal with a lot of things that's the only way to succeed in your best way.

Another reason I agree with this statement is because life isnt easy there are a lot of challenges your gonna come upon and all you have to do is try and if you fail the first time then there's always gonna be another oppurtunity around the corner. What I think churchill is trying to get at people is never give up and he's trying to say that it's okay if you fail the first time you try something there's always gonna be another chance to prove yourself and you can succeed at that goal or test you have in school or something like that. Iv'e failed many times in my life and on the second try i succeeded so churchill has a point when he says that it's okay to fail in life because thta failure prepares you to be better than you were the last time.

That is why I agree with this statement because i believe tha everyone deserves a second chance to prove themselves and what they are campable of. Churchill's statement should really speak to people and people should take it into consideration because there's always a time in life when you are going to fail and you are going to get a second chance at it again. I do completly agree with this statement because it makes you look at life and everything differently and in a better way that is why i agree with Winston Churchill.   "
1897,8EEEF415AA1E,"People can make their own decisions because they can do anything they like, something they aready goal on for a long time. Nobody like to do something that they don't want it, they have their own chose of life decisions on what they want to be or what they want to do.

However, some of the decisions they may have are hard way or easy way, the hard way is they have to try hard in life: study so you can have a good grade and work hard, the easy way is they have to put stuff or money on the first start of they future decisions, is a short way but is really hard and not all people can make that decisions depend on if they want it or not. Also depend on where they at in life for a example: people have alot of money the way they want their decisions on future is more short because they don't worry about other thing tact or payment and people are not have alot of money the way they start their future decisions are more longer because they have to worry about alot of money tact, payment, pay for their car,... also they have a to work more extra hard for they decisions. I meet a friend, he was go to school and work in the same time he was about to out of high school and go to collenge but he maked a bad decision on his life, he about to out of high school but he stop and he said to me that ""go to work are making more money than go to school"" so he stop school, his job now is doing nail that job do sometime do alot of money and sometime don't and he don't want to try more hard, he can go to collnge and later on got a good job make more money than Nail but lose that chance and it change his live forever now he can't take it back. And my brother was the same thing, he was go to collenge for 2 year and than he don't want to be in collenge more so desige to work, if he continue on collenge maybe he got a better job. So sometime people have to think of what about to happen in their future and desige what they gonna be in future lean on what they have and about to have. People can make their own decision but sometime they need help so other can support their life decisions. However alot of people don't know what they gonna do in a future, they don't know what they like or interesting job to do on future so they are stuck, they need help to chose their stuff that may interesting them later on in life.

The chose they have and everything that happen around them to make their own future decisions, and all of the support from people around or family can make it more better decisions on their own life. They have to desige their own life, work hard so they can have a good life on future and do anything they want. If people work hard enough so later on their children can more easy to make their decisions about their own life. "
1098,545E9BF477C1,"the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day.

with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out.

i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day.

with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students.

with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail.    "
2735,C93925EDB882,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a quote that has Inspired me,""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". I truly agree with this quote because it demonstrates who you really are by doing hard work,everyone has something to give to the world and it is important for self esteem.

By doing a lot of hard work and not giving up, it demonstrates to people who you really are, that you are a person who is determined to get where they want to be and who preservers no matter what the chanlleges are. People may or may not agree with what want you want to do, their are always going to be someone who is going to try to bring you down emotionaly, physically or mentally but you have to show them that you are going to be yourself and do what whatever it needs to take to accomplish it. This reminds me of myself because in my senior year of High School I didn't have enough credits in order to graduate that really got my family disappoint that the time I was going to an online school and it was harder for me to make up for all the classes but I saw how my own family started to put me down and it did hurt my feelings but that used that feeling to pick myself up and work everyday on the classes to be able to graduate on time. This showed people and most importantly it showed me that im capable of showing people who I really am by doing hardwork.

I think everyone has a lot to offer to this world, you never know who will be the next person to discover a cure for a illness that people thought it was terminal. Everyone is capable of doing what there heart desires it just take determination, hard work and desire to accomplish what you want. People should not listen to what other's say it only matters what you know that you can accomplish and that you believe in yourself that is all it takes to became and be where you want to be. My plans after High School is to go to college to become a ultrasound technician. I speak two languages Spanish and English and I believe because I speak two languages fluently I have something to give to the world, to the community and to any one in need. I know my own family wanted me to be a lawyer to help people with immigration lawsuits and for a while I started to consider following my parents dream of me being a lawyer to make them happy but my passion for the medical field was bigger and from my knowledge a big percent of pregnant women are Hispanic and as a person who speaks Spanish very well,I think I could help out people who don't know English in order to get the resources they need.

Being yourself and showing the world what you are capable of shows the world that you believe in yourself and it is important for your self esteem too because it makes you feel good about yourself and most of time your going to be alone doing your own stuff, taking care of your business. You can not always depend on people to get you what you need, to get you where you want to be. I remember when I moved out of my parents house with my son and having my own room, my own space and paying bills made me feel so good about myself. I finally felt like I was doing something for myself because my parents wanted to keep me at home but I managed to get through everything and anything while living on my own and It made me more independent person and it helped me boost my energy and believe in myself.

Nevertheless, Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". This quote has reminded that you should truly believe in yourself, be yourself, do hard work and it will motivate you to be where you want to be. I think this quote has a lot of different meanings and I think it depends on your own personal experiences and It has honestly helped me a lot through my teenage year and overall my biggest accomplishment was to follow my heart and be who I really want to be in life just like the Ralph Waldo Emerson said.

3732,F8A3497B5F2D,"Many schools allow their students to visit different types of companies so they could explore many interested jobs,for example schools and companies get in a deal to help students to get knowledge for their future and also companies allow students to be able to visit and get information in their occupations,I know as a fact that students can be professionals in what they want with good knowledge,as a example my whole family went through all of that and know they have become lawyers,doctors,and one of them works for the president. If managers give students the opportunity to visit their occupations,students who work hard won't lose that excellent opportunity,and managers would have an amazing great roll in students achievement which I know it would help the company. Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future.

Some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,for example,my older brother had the opportunity to visit an important company called ""Dream Big""he expect that in that company they would have information about what he was interest,but sadly it didn't went that well,my brother was sad and angry at the same time,so he made a fake account to talk about the company ,as a result the company decrease in a 20% of people that were involved.

Companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,for example,my mother always tells me a story about how she became a lawyer,she said that as a student,she was preparing herself for the future,thanks to school,they gave her a chance to explore and get some knowledge about lawyers in a company called ""Everything is possible,if you believe it""she had the chance as a lawyer to meet the president,also there is a story about her in the internet,she became a lawyer because she had the opportunity.

I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future for example,I read about an incredible woman who know is a professional chemistry teacher ,in the story gave details about how she became who she is it doesn't specific which company she went to learn about her career,but the point is that she has an excellent job,because she got prepare for it.

Although some say that companies should not give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because if the company that I went to visit doesn't have that much of of opportunities for me to discover,whether I'm interested in what they have,and I may be disappointed ,and probably I would have in mind to talk bad about the company that they don't have sufficient knowledge or information,actually companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,and I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future. As a result schools and companies help students in their goal to have a knowledge with their interest,and for sure parents would be thankful.        "
1698,80DFF2FC7C1F,"i am disagree with this because, is going to have a negative effect because, you are going to lose the comunication with the people.

first reason: you can't go out side to shop.

example:when i was in my country, i was going to the store, i was go in my bike or walk but when i move to the united states i don't need to go because, my mom just call to the store and they bring the prouct or food.

second reason: play games with your friends.

example: the last week, i ask to one of my friend who live in my home country if they continue play games like soccer in the soccer field or anther game in the street , he tell that now they play populars games in the phone and they don't like play games in the street enymore.

third reason: the little boys don't want to do others thing just stay in the phone.

example: my little brother who is to years old, he just want to watch videos on the phone, when my mom take the phone he cry because he want to watch videos or play games on the phone he don't do other things, he don't play with my other brother.

fourth reason:

go to visit family or other places.

example:when i go to visit my family or other places i can leave my phone because everytime we go to visit my family i be bored. and when wi go to visit new places i like to take pictures of the place.

fifth reason: you will be a addicted with your phone or computer.

example: i have a friend here in the school who use the phone in the class, sometimes he is play games , some times he watch videos, when the teacher look at him he is in the phone she tell him to put on his packet or in the back pack but he never do it, some times he sit on the back of the room so the teacher can't see him.

547,29BEFF0B3FA0,"An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. However, it might hurt a person's feeling. Well I disargree with that because, what if someone came up to you and said, my mom bought me this dress and said it looks good at me and asked you if it looks good on her. Well what if you said no it looks ugly for you then, the girl will be hurt and would think that her mom lied to her and will start crying.

Anther reason is, what if your friend got in troublem and said he didn't do it but, you knew he did it and the teacher ask you if he did it and you said yes. Well their're somethings that could happen to you First, nobody will trust you Second, the kid that you snitched on won't be your friend and won't talk to you forever Lastly, everyone will call you a snitch because you snitch on you freind.

However if someone said to you or wrote it to you that they were going to shoot the school. That's when you could tell the principle or the office because, shooting a school is something seriouse that could scare people and if you didn't tell the office or the principle and it happen well it will be something that you will need to live with for the rest of your life because you didn't tell the principle or the office that there was going to be a school shooting."
1999,9735E542665C,"Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.

To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see,

students could not have time to play and do their homework. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.

In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.

Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools

In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. Students needs time with friends and family. "
37,0381BBE47393,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree on what he said about us people always doing something will help us accomplish more. I will explain why i agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote about always being doing something. Even though it sounds like it is not a good thing i will give you my point of view of why it is important to always be active.

First, one of the reason why it is important to be active doing something because you will accomplish more. For me i like to be busy because it will keep me focus,be determined, and keep me motivated. Being busy will help me finish my work or task i am doing. An example would be,i would rather be busy doing homework than just sitting around doing nothing and not being productive. You may have stress if your always busy but at the end it will always pay off.

Second, another reason i agree on why always doing something helps you accomplish more is in time managing. Because you can not always be something and always finish it. People like to time manage so they can finish the work that will keep them occupied the most first. If your always doing something that you need to do it will keep you from doing stuff that will not benefit you. It is good thing to build time for other task you need to do then to just stay focus on one and not accomplish as much.

Lastly, always doing something makes you a proactive person. Being lazy and not being a proactive person will affect you. Because you will not accomplish more than a person who is always doing something and is progressing in their own task they need to be doing. Always doing something is a good habit to have that will help you to always be successful. You will feel more proud of your self for the hard work you put in on your task for being always active on them.

In conclusion, all those reason i talked about are reason why i agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote, About it being a good thing that if we are always doing something we accomplish more. You will never have to worry about not doing a certain task you need to do if your always active and productive. People will not worry about them forgetting to do things if they are always busy and remembering to use their time management skill to help them.  "
3845,FD7DC289E98E,"Many students involve themselves in a lot of school activities to enrich their educational experience, some Students can also learn responsibility, because the students can choose how many activities they would like to do.

The students could also feel more mature by having to talk with their parents to do any activity after school. Students also have the opportunity to make lots of friends by joining clubs or doing sports.

Although if the school controlled the students involvement of doing any activity, the students would have a limit of joining a certain amount of activities after school. That could help the student not stress about all the responsibility they would have to do. The school also makes students have good grades in other to join a club or sport, which helps the students focus on school assignments first. However letting the school control a student, would make the student struggle with responsibility and communication with people.

If a student wants to play a sport and be in a club after school because the student wants to make friends, they shouldn't be limited to joining just one by the school. Instead the student should be allowed to choice and join as many clubs or sports they would like. It would help the student to communicate with people without them being scared or shy to talk to someone. Going out of their comfort zone early would also help a student with finding and working for a job. Communication is one of the most important things in a daily life, and if a student can't join an activity because of their grades, how would the student be able to talk to someone if their scared too.

Joining a lot of activities after school, helps a student with responsibility. When a student is involved in a lot of activities, they learns to use their time wisely and would help them later in life for when they are working. It would also help with daily events like taking out the trash, washing their dishes, cleaning their room, and doing their school assignments. Since they have to be doing well in school to even be doing after school activities. Responsibility is something a student should learn in a early age, and should have during school and after they graduate from high school and even collage.

If a student is committed to doing all the activities they chose to have, they will do great. Not only will they feel good about themselves, but that will make their parents proud and show them that they ready to be independent. That would also look good for when the student signs up for a collage they would like to go to, but also for when they get a job. When someone is committed to their job, their boss will notice that they really wanna work and could even get a raise. Commitment will help a student, because if they believe they can do a lot of school work and do lots of activities, They will feel great about themselves at the end of their high school career. "
1119,56E188D44884,"The first impressions are difficult to change because is something special that forever goes to stay in our minds for example when someone go for the first time to the beach, it is the first impression and is as a picture taken in his mind that will never disappear,there are a bunch of impressions the people can not forget such a new father when he come in the hospital and look at his wife with the baby on her arms is something that is undelete in the mind,good impression are alike to persuase the mind of the people, a beginner political always is trying to leave the best remain in the mind of the people to later get their votes because he win because knew that leave a good first impression was the trick to convince them. The firs impression can be used to persuade but also many times to hurt a person that is why always consider to be carefully at leave it.

I am agree with the statement, never someone could have the capacity to change something have left recorded in his mind, I have examples for my opinions such as an inmigrant who just pass trough the border from mexico and the border patrol cath him up he always going to remember that the border patrol did that his dreams stop because he was an ilegal guy, everybody have different experiences no always the impression going to be to turn us in a happy mood,this stament is quite real, everyone have to think about leave a good impression ever."
2534,BC0703638937,"Haven't you got an advice from multiple adults in your daily life? Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.

He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.

Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one.""

Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. You could also use the people's advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it. This is my thoughts on why some people would like multiple and how it can affect them in a certain way."
137,0ABD502C5BF9,"have you ever needed examples to learn something or you learn better with different ways instead of receiving examples? Well, was as Albert Schweitzer said "" Example is not the main thing to influence others"". this means that there are other ways to influence other without using or giving examples.

One way that people may get influenced is if they receive help from others, not receiving examples; This can be better than give examples to illustrate this, in the class of ceramic the teacher mostly give us examples of how to make clay stuff, she almost never help me and this results difficult for me and for others how to make things because she only explain one time how to do it and some of the students forget about it. when she help someone their project result always to be the best of the class because of her help on the student.

Other people say that when they receive examples sometimes they get confused, this happens when the examples they get make them change their perspective over what they are doing, for example: doing a drawing, sometime the teacher tells to make a drawing of your imagination,this means of your thinking and whatever is on your brain. What could happen when the teacher tell you what to draw after she said that the drawing is about your imagination and she give examples on what to draw this make you think that she wants you to draw others things that are not on your thinking, this shows that sometimes the examples does not work on specific subjects because those get to confuse you.

Although others may say that when they use examples they are more able to influence other because they show the experience that they have on it and also teach how to do something also there are many people that learn better get more influenced when they use examples. I think that there are a few ways that are stronger that make the examples less useful or powerless to influence others. For these reasons I think that there are better ways to influence other without using examples."

446,21884C3DC96A,"I like to work with a group because working with people helps you benefit from a lot of ways. One way is helping each others when working in a group. when i work with my friends we help each other with things that might be hard for us to do. I sometimes don't know how to answer a question so i ask the people i am working with to help me with it. The people you work with might not know something that i might know so that's a good thing when you work in groups. I like to help my friends or my group members with any thing because thats what group work is about.

2.

When working in a group we communicate a lot and talk about everything we have to do. i like to talk when i work in a group it even helps me learn more things that i did not know about. Sometimes i don't know how to say something in English so i ask my partner to help me say it or pronounce it. When i don't know something it's hard for me to talk about it or try to help when i don't understand what they are talking about. its good for me to work in group because it helps me learn more English.

3.

working in groups helps you and your partners to do less work. When i work in a group we split the work fairly if someone does not like the part he/she have to do we will give them a different one. For me i like to do the most easy one but i do not get that all the time sometimes i have to do a hard part and sometimes i have to do a easy part. I do struggle with things sometimes because i do not speak good English but i ask my partners to help me with what ever i do not understand.

4.

One way to get to know people better is working with them and talk to them. When i work with people it shows me who the person is and what they like to do. For me i like to know people better and make them comfortable around me even if they are shy. Some people don't like working in groups because they like to work by them self which is not a bad thing. Talking to people is one of my favorite things to do especially if i know the person more.

5.

It would be great for me to work in a group because it benefits me with a lot of things in a lot of ways. one thing is to get help from others and help others. The second thing is communication when u talk to people it helps me learn new things and they might be learning new things too, and i do not do as much work as if i was working by myself. its really good for me to work in groups because of all these things.

2005,976E2E05C4EB,"Some businesses only work 4 days in the week maybe to conserve energy or maybe to the employers can rest one more day. I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework and they could work too. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for this students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where i am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids.

In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because i have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came only four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom.

I agree with the businesses who only open

4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when i was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we don't had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you don't pay the energy."" and sometimes i get mad because i wanted to listed music and watched TV.

Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parent, student, and labor and the week is to short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because it's not easy to anyone to be responsible. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers and I was think how can she do all those things and then I realized that she wake up everyday because she want the best for us and doesn't matter how tired she felt. We can't ""never give up"" because fighting.

In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things. The Government will can make that my dream came be true to have only 4 days of school."
856,41D9F5D10332,"I believe that students accomplish more when they are always doing something. That serves more of a purpose than not doing anything at all. Students learn more when they are doing something productive. Students accomplish more when they take action. Another reason why students accomplish more when doing something is that they get farther in life than others. Lastly they get mature and learn what life is about. That why i choose that when a students get all those thing in place the student will accomplish more that someone that is not doing anything in life in their whole lifetime.

The reason I choose that we accomplish more when doing something is that we cant accomplish something when not moving doing nothing. My first reason why we accomplish more when when doing something is that when we do something we are learning. For example in the 4th grade i was really mad at math , so I took action and practiced everyday after school for the rest of the year. I would get good grade after i took action and studied every night. What I'm trying to say is that i wouldn't have accomplish that if i wouldn't have done something. Another example is that studies show that students that are always doing things at home or after school do accomplish more than students that don't do anything at all. Finally they learn how to mange their time more better.

Students that accomplish things get more farther in life than others. For example my aunt is a doctor and she put her mind in everything that she did. For example she took a lot of test to take and study for. So what did she do she always was multitasking. Another example is that a person that has made so many challenges in life is going to understand that you need too do something for it.

Finally the reason is that students when they are doing their work they are going to understand what it means to be a adult.,and to be more mature in life. Students get mature when they start work and going to school because they start to mange their time more wisely. Like for example a students is going to work right after school and they have a lot of work to do. They make that time do do their work some other time when they have time or at work on break. Another example is that if a students have a goo example in life they will get really intelligent .

Finally students that accomplish more are the students that are doing something in life other that just doing nothing. Students that are accomplish more are learning life skills. Students that accomplish more are going to get farther in life than others that aren't doing anything. Students that are accomplish more things are going to become mature. For knowing that they are doing thinks that are smart."
3407,EA105A8B8699,"I agree because in life you can achieve many goals and pass through so many good things like me i always think positive thats why so many good things happen to me also never disagree because in life you never know what could actually really happen maybe something bad that you have no clue about . Life is great if you keep a positive attitude for example give people advice on somethig good maybe one day they will do the same for you be greatfull with what you have or get beacsue soem people dont have what you have and they really want . Thats why i always have a postive attitude beacuse when i make good discissions i get what i want.

Here are some examples of why you shoud agree for example you get a job a costumer comes by needs help you give them a positive attitude they will give you a positive attitude to help eachother out give them respect talk to them nicely you never know something good could happen second of all what could happen if you give them a bad attitude they will give you the same attitude to. Look at the bright side what happens when you them a positive attitude and they give you a bad attitude you keep the same attitude no matter what they will see and think to their head wow he or she has a nice attitude while the perrson is giving them and ungreatfull attitude.

Always be the bigger person with great attitude even if the person is having a bad day probably try to give them a positive attitude and probably you might cheer them up its always good to make people feel good about themselves afterwards you will feel good because you helped them out . Its never a bad thing to have a positive attitude because good things will come to you ."
2651,C444D6A0AC1C,"Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldn't made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student don't want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities.

First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents don't wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents don't want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools.

Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student don't want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student don't want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision.

Lastly, some student don't want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then it's up to their families choice, but most of students don't want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents.

This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. For me I disagree that school should not make a decision for students, decision should made by students families or by their parents for my three reasons. "
1654,7DAD3B639FB4,"Many people say how wonderful it is that much can be done if we are always doing something. But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing something to perserve our future and make it safe and way better then how our generation is now. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ''determine never to be idle'' which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then would've never done anything like build roads or invent automobiles or anything, we would've never had what we have now.

Inactivity can also serve a pupose to our society and how our future is going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people would've been inactive. Everything that we built and invented would'nt be here in this generation or the next one. We probably would've been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there would'nt be any people working or there would'nt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. We would've been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future.

We all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose."
1670,7EED34A43536,"Inside of each people always has the right and the wrong sides. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.

First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.

Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life.

In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.

Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves."
1300,63BAE4B3ADDA,"Being yourself in a world that wants you to be something else is a great feeling but it takes time to be happy for a example,your parents want you to be a doctor or a lawyer but you want to be a rapper or dancer but you don't know how to tell them because you think they would would be disappointed.

would you want to make your parents to feel disappointed,ll give another example people who like the same sex, theirs been so many stories an articles of people dying because their expressing them selves a lot of people are scared so they don't tell anyone so they become depressed they use a lot drugs to lose the pain but nothing ever works.

In my opinion i agree with Ralphh Waldo Emerson it's a amazing feeling to be yourself and not follow other people because at the end of the day you need to be doing things that make you happy not for other,your priories come first be who ever you want to be like and who ever you want you live one life."
3266,E3097287CBD1,"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help.

Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too.

Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.

When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.

Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest,

but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.

Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work. In my personal option school should not have online classes or video conferencing. Student are going to have a better knowledge if they go to school and, they work with teacher. School should let student enjoy take their high school life and not have online classes."
1902,8F29D9B8D64E,"Have you heard about this aweson!! place, where no matter what you do, you will be amazed for all the things that are in that wonderful park? well.... that one place is Generic_City park. Generic_City park it's located in Pennsylvania and is one of the places I would like to go there with my family. One of the reasons is because there are great attractions, like roller coasters and games. One thing I would like to see as soon as I arrive is the Chocolate factory and the Lazy river that is in the Aquatic park.

As I said before, ""There are awesome attractions in

Generic_City park"" let me talk to you about this amazing roller coaster I would love to ride and the name of that roller coaster is 'The Super dooper looper'.

The Super dooper looper is one of the greatest roller coasters and the reason is because this roller coaster has more loops then the other attractions and one of the loops is super big. But that's just the beginning, there is also one section in Generic_City park that I would like to go too, and is the area where all the video games are and you can win tickets every time you win a game. You can win prizes with those tickets and you can also buy food near that place.

I also said that I wanted to see the chocolate factory. The chocolate factory shows you the process of how they make that delicious chocolate, you can see everything there, from the beginning to the end, that is one of the best places I would love to go because you can't only see how they make chocolate, you can also buy it and feel the taste of the best chocolate ever 'Kisses'. The chocolate 'kisses' is one of my favorite chocolates that's why I would like to see the chocolate factory.

The aquatic park it's the best place to not feel to hot when is super sunny outside. Everybody sweats when they scream and feel the adrenaline of the roller coasters. After all of that you want to just relax and enjoy your day after walking and waiting in line, Well the Lazy River is one of the pools you would like to go in while you do nothing. The lazy river is one of all the attraction I would like to go. The fun part is that in the lazy river is that you can talk with your friends, and enjoy the journey after a long and fun day.

And that's is one of the places that I would like to go and maybe you will like to go, because Generic_City Park is a fun place where you can have fun with your family and friends, and have an amazing and unforgettable day, with so much adventures and fun."
2450,B68C62AB1515,"Careers are a big part of a person's life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a person's personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do everyday, and they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives.

Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often don't know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there.

A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students don't really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who don't take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students don't know what to do in their free time. Also, students don't really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes don't really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them.

Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them.

A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they won't have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens don't know what they wanna do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they won't have that problem later on. In fact they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age won't have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older won't have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students aren't as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they wanna be.

If a student who doesnt know at all what they wanna be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they won't be as stressed.

Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they arent well educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career so they can be sucessful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time. Finally they won't have any stress or problems later on in finding a job. "
1763,858DFA7A9980,"Good Morning,

I just want to start this letter by telling you a little bit more about my interest towards your company . As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage .

Farther more, I'm very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers.

For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what I'm going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company

For example, what is exactly the job I'm going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc.

If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do.

I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers. I believe I can apport a lot to this company."
1368,6932E62C6338,"Thomas Jefferson was a president, and he wrote this to help people to do their work always.

It is really good when we are doing our work and it will be done when we doing it always and we will learn it to do it will be easy for ourself.

Somtime it will be boring to do our work always but it is good that we can learn it really good if we do it always.

I am doing my work and my job and my sport always because it will help me to remember it and also doing always is good that can learn us till we can teach it for example: when we are reading a book always it will help us to learn a lot about everything the people that they are not doing good and always there work and there job they are lazy people and they will not learn anything when they do not doing it always.

If we think about it we can see the diffrent between the people that they doing always are better than the people that they do not doing it always so like: doing homwork always, sleeping on time always, going to sport always, going to job always and etc.

We will help the people and tell them to there there work always we should help them.

In the first when the school start i was not good and i was not doing my homworks and studing always until my friends help me and told me to do my work always and i am glad that i learn this to do my work always and i want everyone to do there work always never forget it. And also when we are always eating good food it will keep us healthy and we do not need go to the doctor always.

keep doing it always."

1865,8C5BF0347F87,"People around the world have thought about the way students should be teach or the way they should be treated but a few have notice that many students are struggling to build self-esteem. Students have difficulties and they affront them without their parents' help. Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Although some people say praising student's deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students.

According a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Praising them probably won't help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote.

However, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For example Generic_Name, my friend's brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life.

Even though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever.

In addition, praising student's deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year.

In conclusion, self-esteem comes from the student's best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. Because of his great achievements,

Apple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work. Every people have different thoughts about how a student should be teach but whatever they choose will influence their children's life forever."
3604,F3550CF50ABC,"Have you ever wonder how our character is formed? John Lubbock once wrote, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.

Many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourself and not caring what anyone thinks however, I think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them. For example, if my friends are always skipping school and they ask me to skip school with them and I am going to say yes since, they are my friends. What most do us do is ,that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school.

Another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. Social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. For example, on social media there is a lot of models, and singers. A lot of young teens want to be like them so they will change the way the look and act. Since society has made it seem that if you don't look like Kylie Jenner or any other famous person that you're not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character.

Finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. For example, if I am at school and I want to be friends with a group of girls I will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. Since I want them to like me I will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others.

I urge you to think about your character if it's formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by who you surround yourself with. We should not let people choose how they want our character to be. I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us."
149,0B6316123881,"Duke Ellington said, "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Do you think a problem is a good way to learn form your mistake? Learning from your mistake is a great way to know, what you did wrong, and how you can fix the problem.

What does he mean by "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best.""? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don't. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.

I do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don't really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn't care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.

I made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn't care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job. One of my other mistake is my anger. I would always get angry but I always try to clam down because I would always take it out on people, but it won't hurt to try to learn form your mistakes.

Everyone can learn from their mistakes and it won't hurt to try. The benefits is knowing what to do when the mistakes happens again. Like what Duke Ellington once said, ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."""
3188,E03B6B157C32,"""Does true self-esteem comes from praise or does it come from achievement."" Self-esteem comes from achievement because it makes you feel good. It makes you feel that you could do anything. Also you can learn not to give up.

Self-esteem comes from achieving, it will make you feel good about yourself. For example, if Generic_Name achieves shooting five times at the three point line and makes all of them; he will feel good about himself. His self-esteem is feeling good so he may try to do more next time at the three point line. But feeling good about yourself is not the only thing that will help with your self-esteem.

Another is it will make you feel that you could do anything. For example, if Generic_Name wins the art fair only in her class, but the school is having an art fair for the whole sophomore class. Her self-esteem will kick in and she may sign up

Also you can learn how to not give up for example if Generic_Name lose the class discussion but the class is going to have another one the next day she is going to try her hardest to win the next class discussion.

I think that achievement will help kids with their learning because nowadays kids like winning and winning things at the end it makes their self-esteem built up."
332,188FE8830590,"Is it better to finish high school early? Yes, I would say finishing high school in three years is better. Why? because you can start college early, or go into the work force, and you can have the time to explore the world.

By doing this 3 year program, you can start college early. In today's society, finishing school early may be a big benefit. If I had the chance to do this program, I would take that chance. You may be looked at different but in a good way. Also, by starting college early it can be a huge advantage to your future.

Finishing school early can bring you into the work force. I would believe by finishing school early, it can be a huge benefit for looking for new jobs. Also, putting on your resume that you graduated early, the employers would look into it and see that you had to take summer and evening classes. You would look your very intelligent and responsible.

If having a year off, and don't know what to do, you can explore. If I had that year off I would use the time to see new things, things that i've never seen before. By taking the year off, you would still be on track in your schooling. In life some people don't want to go into school because it is overwhelming. Have the time to go out, if not then you'll regret not having that time to yourself.

By taking a 3 year course of high school, you can start looking into jobs, have time to explore, and you can start college early. Some say that finishing high school early, you don't get the same high school experience as others that don't do the 3 year program. But finishing high school a year early, can bring you more benefits than just doing the normal 4 years. In the future I believe that high school will only be 3 years of schooling."
1036,4F35BA561593,"Some people ask if it is better to work with a group or alone? Everyone has different opinions about the benefits of working in a group or working alone, some people prefer working alone and others prefer working in groups. I believe that the best way for the people to improve is by working in groups because they learn more and understand better.

First, working in groups help the people to improve in school or at work because they learn new things. For example, listening other ideas and points of view from their partners. One day my English teacher make groups of four in class and gave each group a piece of paper, then he put some questions in his board and told us that we need it to answer them as a group, when we finish the teacher told us that we were going to discuss it, then when each group discuss their answers with the class we all realized that each group had different opinions, ideas, and points of view. Each group learn something new from each other.

""Everyday we all learn new things in life"".

Second, working in groups help the people improve because they will understand better. For example, asking their partners if they have a question or didn't understand really well. My history teacher gave the class an assignment that we need it to completed by the end of the class, when the teacher gave the instructions i didn't understand her really well, then i ask one of my partners if he could explained to me again in order for me to understand it, be able to give my opinions and help my group.

""We could do more if we all help each others"".

Many people believe that is better to work alone because they will concentrate more. For example, they will not get distracted with anyone and will finish the work faster. A friend of mine has always work alone because she said that when the people is working in groups they tend to start talking, distract others, don't do their work and by the end of the hour only got a couple of questions done. However, this argument is meaningless because if they don't understand really well, then they would not have a partner who could explained to them what they are doing. For example, not finish their work because they got stuck in a part. Not having someone to discuss the work with could be hard sometimes.

In conclusion, there's a lot of benefits when working with a group. Some of the others benefits that working in groups has are; making new friends, having the opportunity to learn more about your partner, and learn more about yourself. Having to work with someone is a good idea because you don't have a lot of pressure about having to finish the work on time or not having idea what to do. Even though some people say the opposite, i believe that working in groups is better than working alone.

""Sometimes you will need a little help from others in order for you to improve"".    "

When it has to do with life's important matters people should be self-reliance. Making your own decisions in what you'r instincts tells you, or even ideas that crosses your mind. Can lead you to the path you want to be in. All decisions or ideas you have should be followed.

Making choices or even having ideas about your own life matters, it's important Because at the end of the day it's your life and you want to always make the choices for yourself. Your life dosen't effect others, what you want to pursue or have should be done by the choices you decide.

1780,86B2AFB816D5,"Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. The employers look for people's responsible, and make a good job. Most time the employee do not have experience, and many time the employers look those. Many people look for a job without have experience for a better life, and learning new stuff. In lots places taking decision for giving job for people's do not have experience.

First, most of people do not have to study by cause not working, by do not have experience, and do not can pay the study. The employers can giving news opportunities of working for people's have a better life, and future. Anyhow, the employee doing a hard-working, and the employers be glad. When the employee doing a hard-working is for news opportunities.

Second, nevertheless when you are responsible may-be your employers giving a raise. To be a good employee help always for letter of recommend about your ability. Also more people have the requisite by working; although needing experience but can learned. A job can teach the people's a lot things. For example, responsibility, respect, and more manners. The manners is very important in your potential, and your characteristics is important too, because the employers evaluate this.

Some may say, which people's do not have experience can not working, because thinking this persons have a bad conduct. Most employers think which the employee do not following the rules, and doing a bad job. When the employers misjudge a people's because not have experience this remove the opportunities; but the reality is everyone learning, and have the privilege of working.

3458,ECCAD55DE7BA,"I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I think it does because it helps us learn on what to do. We can teach other the same way as well.

We have other people helping us in different ways. For example, we can teach them different ways on doing things they don't feel comforable and that they would feel conforable if they keep doing it. Although it may take time to get use to it they would have experience at the end. Also those people can teach other people. Learning new stuffs is hard but if its a good idea people should do it.

I think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lifes. For example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. Although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. It can be helpful to others in the world. I think they would know a lot more if they did.

We would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. For example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. Although it would need a lot of taking to one each other. It can help by not getting to one an other. Getting to know new people by doing things.

If your not doing things you won't get anything accomplish in life. For example, if you don't do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job. People can stop being lazy and do their work. They can ask for help if they need it. If they ask they would have a lot accomplish."

98,076262AA0CD5,"The Curfews Keep Teenagers Out Of Trouble

Once, I walked down the empty street during midnight. Then, I heard a rising sound of a strange footstep behind me. Suddenly, I felt anxious and scared that someone might come up to me and murder me for money. Lucikly, there was nothing happened to me. After I got home, I had a thinking that what if a city council adopts a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is published, any teenager who is wandering on the street after those hours would be violating the law. On the other hand, some might believe that the curfews unfairly interfere in young people's lives because it does not let the teenagers have their freedom and accomplish something that is very important to them, which they cannot do it another time. I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night.

Some people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews aren't carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure.

The curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents' awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many companies prefer to choose employees with a good moral because they did not commit any crime in the past, which proves that they will not cause any danger while working in the companies. Unfortuantely, people who had done any crime or violated any law in the past will more likely to stay unemployed because they are considered to be dangerous. The curfews is brought out to protect all teenagers's future from being damaged by any of their wrongful commitment.

The curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because most of them would not want to be kidnapped or murdered while walking on the street at night. To prevent any harmful cause that can happen to young people, the U.S. government should set up curfews for teenagers. In fact, there are many unfortunate cases of missing teenagers in America. This fact proves that numerous teenagers had been kidnapped while they wander around empty public places at night. In this case, the U.S. government should adopt curfews law because it can decrease the act of kidnapping teenagers. However, some teenagers are killed while they are going out at night because there are a lot of robbers appear during this time. To solve this problem, the U.S government should let the city council bring out the curfews law, which can restricts all teenagers from going out at night and protect them from being murdered.

In conclusion, curfews law is significant because it can reduce the criminal acts within a society. It shapes the society to be more organized and less dangerous to the citizens. The curfews can keep teenagers out of trouble because it restricts teenagers from committing any unfortunate crime. It helps teenagers to become better individuals in society who treat others in a correct way. Specially, teenagers can avoid death and being kidnapped when they obey to the curfews and stay home at night. Lastly, we should set up curfews and believe that it can protect all teenagers from getting trouble because they are going to be the one who runs the planet one day."
40,038480498E5A,"Dear Principal,

I think that it is a great idea for you not to allow students that have a C average to participate in sports. My first reason, is because a lot of kids who have good grades such as B' s and A' s they don't get as distracted in school. Therefore, they will be focused better in their activity, and not in doing something like homework. People who have C' s, D' s , and F' s they will not be focused in the sports activity because they have to worry about doing homework and getting their grades up. Because they are responsible for having bad grades they shouldn't participate in school activities. Maybe you ask ""What if someone has the potential in playing but doesn't have the grades"". Its probably because they get to distracted, in playing sports and not doing their work. Kids who have bad grades tend to be lazy, and if we let them be on the team how can we expect to win if one of the members is not even participating. Another reason why, you should have good grades and be able to participate in activities is because it will look good when you go to college. There are more chances for you to get into a better college that you will like. And when you get a job you will get a well paying job. In conclusion, that is why I think the principal shouldn't let students who have a lower than a C average participate in school sports activities. One because they are lazy, and not well focused in school. I think it will be way better if kids who have good grades get the credit for participating in both sports and class work. These are my reasons why I think students who have B average should be involved in school activities and kids who have a C average shouldn't.      "
3757,F9BE4676CA35,"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity.

To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won't even have breathing problems or mostly any issues.

How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot .

Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isn't just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun .

collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren't just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. Like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . Have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you can't take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .Also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others .

Having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .Also because it doesn't hurt you to give it a try . I agree fully with the principal because not everything is a lot what you want you have to just go with it ."

1881,8DD09D4FCD4F,"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study?

Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school.

In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, student's grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved.

Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying.

Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken.

In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken. "
1108,558C7F83201B,"do you think students should have a career plan by time thy enter high school ? i think no , because they can always change their minds ., like if they end up not like the career they thought they wanted at first . and they pick a new one . in high school you have to take math and history and science and many other classes . and then you pick electives you are interested in . and high school students have to pass all there classes and some high school students have after school activities like staying after for extra help on subject or being on a school teams and clubs . and they just want to hang out with there friends and family and have fun and not to worry to much on what career they want to have in the future . and they might have other stuff going on . and i dont think its a good idea to commit to a career at a young age because your interests change .and i think students shouldn't be expected to that early on. and its not a good idea."
411,1F4961D46D29,"Imagination Over Mind

Imagination it's what sparks our creativity. Without imagination, knowledge means nothing because we wouldn't be able to come up with anything. How we create intricate characters and stories and how incredible buildings stand tall. This is due to imagination and how we come up with such things. Take a second and think of your favorite character from any source of media. They were created because someone imagined them and brought them to life. Imagination is all around us from our stories and music to our basic everyday items. That pen on your desk was imagined up to be able to write and pass along information.

For ages people imagined stories and people listened. People and imagined plays,movies,books,TV and video games all with different stories and design. These things may seem insignificant, but people adore these stories and have been inspired. They have been mesmerized by these worlds and characters. Imagination is what leads people to create these stories. These stories have taught us messages and life lessons also. They inspire us to be best version of our self and to follow our dreams, as we see the characters do. We grow close to characters and relate with them, making these stories more special to us. Imagination gave us inspiring role models and heroes, they also gave us a childhood. How we wait to see our favorite cartoon and smile with excitement waiting for the next adventure to unfold. Imagination gave life to unforgettable characters, how Walt Disney created Micky Mouse and countless other. These characters and stories aren't just for children but adults as well. Stories of all genres exist to bring new experiences and worlds to the audience. Imagination gave us stories to inspire,scare,to make us laugh or even cry for the character. Imagination gave life to countless of stories something knowledge could never do alone.

From the Eiffel Tower to an small little house, people imagined buildings and ways to construct them. It's true you need to understand and know how to build but imagination is more important. Imagination is what let us think of such designs. Even in ancient times people put imagination and knowledge to build a house. Whether it's building a mud house or straw hut people imagined putting all of it together and put it in action. How people designed cars for transportation and made it function properly. Engineers are creative and imaginative to come up with such intricate designs and models. Even everyday objects were imagined and made to help you in everyday life. Whether it's a juicer to a wrench, people imagined these things to serve a purpose. How biomechanics creates prosthetic arms and legs to help the disabled to move again. Theses things all started as thought to help society and now are a vital part in today society. Imagination is what led man kind to create items to help us in everyday life.

Music is an form of art where people express their emotions through song. Instruments were imagined for the sole purpose to create art. Then playing the instrument led to more creative thinking, then songs were imagined and instruments added to that. Songs are written with heart and they express the artists' emotions. They are imagined and written down, sometimes using metaphors to express their emotions. People say that they can say things through music that they couldn't say with words. Being able to imagine such meaningful songs that leave a such an impact on the listener is incredible. Music speaks to people in a way words can't and the artist that make them are imaginative people.

Imagination led these artist to produce such songs and music. Painting is an other form of imaginative art. These artist express themselves by using strokes of paint to produce vibrant works of art. Even though a painting is silent people speak through them to show such meaningful works of art. Artists imagine what they want to paint and execute and you can see such a passion in their works of art. Imagination inspires artist to create outstanding pieces of art.

Imagination also expresses itself in the way we dress and life style. For the most part we choose the way we dress,where we work and what we do. When not in uniform or work clothes we choose how we dress. We imagine ourselves a certain way and choose to expresses ourselves that way. Our hair and how we choose to style it also reflects our personality. Whether it's colored,straight,curly or even no hair at all. We also imagine what we want in our lives and choose to study for that career. Our hobbies and interest also show what kind of person you are. How you spend your free time is how you reflect yourself. Our appearance and hobbies are a self reflection of our imagination and who you are. Imagination makes you who you are, and that's what makes everyone a different person.

Imagination might not seem important but it's what allows people to create stories, construct buildings, create items,produce music,to make art and makes you. We need imagination even more than we need knowledge. Without imagination there wouldn't be a way to put our knowledge to use. Imagination is the fuel of the world, it's what keeps everything going. It may seem insignificant at first but imagination is so such more. Without imagination no advancements would be made. We need imagination to do almost everything life. Imagination is what makes us human. Imagination over mind.        "
2088,9CB6D9467227,"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesn't mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key.

First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and I'm convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that aren't related to what I want or succeed. I try to stay as focused as possible because once I'm determined and make that my main focus, then It'll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal.

Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if

I

don't believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for.

Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then that's one way i can always succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I won't give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority.

Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think it's a huge difference when you do because that's peoples main focus in life. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! "
2709,C78951522AC0,"Dear, manager i want to know more about your business. What opportunities do you give your employees? I want to know new things from your business. I would love to go and have a position there. I'm interested to give it a try in your business. A professional like you can teach me how everything works and how you maintain everything under control with your employees.

And specially if its from a company with great quality and management. Also i can learn how to socialize with people. Learning how to communicate is important for a company so everything is in order. Some companies don't know how to communicate and to be organize. They've to be anti-social so they can focus on their work and not on other employees otherwise there's consequence. Some companies are very strict with their employees. For examples employees have to be obedient to every single thing. As in they've to follow every step correctly or they would get fired or worst.

Thirdly, Your company is understandable to your employees. You treat them with respect and love as if they were your family. I heard that if your employees had a emergency you would be generous and support them no matter what. I never heard one complain from your company either. However, its the exact opposite. people who works there seems to love it and to enjoy it! They've learned to be responsible and respectful in your company. You also are fair with your employees. Employees in that company gets payed well with no complains. They get payed exact the hours they've been working.

However, the way you manage your customers is incredible. Your customers are never disappointed what they order is exactly what they get. Employees always have a smile on their faces when receiving a customer. They're always gentle and polite. But more importantly patient because they're a lot of customers who are slow or aggressive, they like to get attention. As great employees they handle any challenges. And i think it's a perfect start for me because I'll do everything right with no excuses. In the other hand, your company is always nice and neat you make sure that the place looks good and prepared just in case important visitors come to visit your company.

Mean while, i think the environment needs more companies as an this one. because everything about this company is splendid and spectacular. They've great service and employees.

That giving up is not a answer. I would like to be a outstanding person for your company. I want to tell everyone about how amazing your company is and how wonderful everyone who work there is. The organization in your company is great you keep everything in order.

In conclusion, I think i am very interested in learning about your company more and actually try to work there. I want to feel that joy and that responsibility i have to have. I want to spend time learning and practicing in your company. Your company has shown me that not all companies are bad as they say nor terrible. In my opinion i think companies should be more like this one. So if i could get the opportunity to go and check it out and learn that would be amazing. Because i never heard of a company this generous before. And i would definitely would love to know more about it. Everything about your company is great for example communication,organization,employees and deals. It sounds entertaining and enjoyable. This is a enormous deal for me. So Mr. Manager i would like to go and visit it. I could also work that exact day if you want me to it would be a pleasure to work in a amazing company."
1759,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.

First, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.""

Second, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.

I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.

Don't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.

In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.

So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.

This goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

So please please please i beg you am just asking for just once; but if i don't pass thank you for taking your time on reading it; plus English is my second language and i dont understand it that much, and i can't read it that well either.    "
396,1DFAE221EE14,"Generic_School plans to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the student's favorite cafeteria foods. Students would get better nutrions from eating more healthly foods. Also students eating healthy foods would help them stay focus in class. The change to the school lunch menu is a good idea becasue this benfits the students health and education purposes.

Changing the school lunch menu would help students stay focus in class. Many researchers believes that when students eat healthy, they are more likely to pay attention and do good on thier quizes and tests. Students eating junk food will make them feel lazy and make them feel tired during class. Students will not have stomach problems during class if they eat healthy foods. Students eating healthy makes them succed in all of thier classes.

Changing the school lunch menu would also help students have better nutrion. They will be more active after school and not be lazy. Students that have after school activites like sports, need good nutrions to perform well.

Students that have good nutrions would feel good about themselves during school and after school.

Althought other students dose not want the lunch menu to change because they want to eat thier favortie cafeteria foods. This is bad because they will not have a good nutrions for after school clubs. Also they will be very sleepy in their classes and not be focused.

The school cafeteria menu is very important because it decides wheather a student will be successful in their classes or not. The school cafeteria menu should change because students will not get the right nutrions for thier classes and after school activities. They will also fall asleep in class if they eat junk food."
1100,5494132B7229,"Is better for students that are entering high school to know what they want to do after they finish high school? some pleople will say yes but some will say no and they are not wrong or right anwer in thise question is depending in your point of view and how fast you want to achive your goal and how good you want to be in your carrer and work.

The people that say yes they say that because when you know what career you want to take before entering high school you wiil choose you classes better depending in your career and what high school you want to attend because come schools have programs that count like college classes, and in high school you have only four years and that is not enough time for you to choose and you will end up in a carrer that you don't like if you choose the wrong one. If you know what you want to be you will cofus better in that career . You can join programs to help you more in your goals and when you know your goals you can achive them better. You also will try to see how can you get a scholarchip for your carrer and what college are better for you, and you will mead people that like the same thing as you and you can make friends. When you join programs some time you can get a scholarchip if you are good. For example my friend want to join the army so he is taking jrotc to help hem do better in the army but my other friend wants to do soccer for college so he is taking advance p. e. to be in shape and he is also in the school team to get a scholarchip, and me I'm taking business classes to help me know more about business marketing because I want to put my own store and Im putting everything of me to do that because that is my goal and i want to do the best of me in that project of my life.

People that say that you don't have to know what you want to be before you get in to high school. They say that you can join different programs and see wich one you like the most and you will choose your career from that decition and you will know what's about because some people choose careers that they don't like them maybe because they dind't know the stuff you have to do or they dind't expect to be like that. Is better to waste four years then wasting your entire live in a career that you don't like. you sholl try to get a scholarchip that way you don't pay for college.

If you dind't have a scholarchip and finish college and you are working in a career that you don't like and you dind't have a sholarchip you are going to be in debt and you are going to pay alot. If you only study for one year in college and you fell like that career is not for you you have to play for that year and is not cheap so you have to choose your career when you are in high school and see what's about before entering and if you like it because if you don't like that career you are going to waste your time. For example I dind't know what career I like before high school so I join jrotc and i dind't like it and a teacher told me to take business classes and I like it so I chose to do business for my career.

In conclution both of them are good options but if you know what you want to be before high school you can see what's that carrer is about in high school and if you dont like it you can change it and the other one you will have more chooses because you will not focus in only one career you will see more oportunitis. Is depending in the choose you make. All of thise dipend in how you are because evryone is defferent and not everyone is going for the same opsion. But for both of them you have to do your best in school to achive your goal and get a schoolarchip that way you dont pay for college. But first of all we have to finish high school and get good greads. and remember that is only one life so do your best and try to live the life that you want and don't let others tell you that you can't do something just belive in your self and that will be a big change adn wen you are in college do your best and do your work and life the live chill."
1448,6F0330A6C504,"This shows how students could think and have thoughts about what they want in the future, a career is what benefits them in their lives, preparing them would make a change in their minds on what they really are interested in or what would they want to be successful in their future, it would take time to prepare to finally decide whats on their minds to choose their careers as a young age, this opportunities will make a big change is students choose wisely.

After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying,thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose,deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have this opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life,the're changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers starts to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be do for being graduated as a honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as a older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life.

This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think the're going to be success.

However, letting young kids think on what the're going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didn't decide what career they want to take, most of students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldn't get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didn't want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didn't decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what they're looking for in real life as a young adults.

By telling this students should see and think very carefully as parents understands their children and teachers helping their students how they could or might do to get that career on what they need to focus on, for society is really difficult to choose right ways hat might help students and which ones might not letting students choose sense their getting more knowledge they will increase the capacity to get into what career benefits them as students,there are many student that want a career and the society helps them with their courses a they are getting into High School, their final thoughts and knowledge finish for them and they should start to think more in what he career is and how they're going to deal with their job "
702,35D983476332,"Dear. Reader's

It's all my pleasure to be writing this answer, thank you for give me this opportunity to express my opinion and ideas based on my experiences. Even if my answer is agree or disagee; i believe that the life is short and you never know when is going to end. The first impression too but in this case we can know when is going to finish because is a big different between this two. I'm disagree with the statement that the first impressions are almost impossible to change, i believe that we can change the first impression but not in one second i'm gonna tell you some reason the i feel with my experiences that i want to know you.

First, ""the first impression the you receive is very important"" Well i'm not sure of that but is something that other poeple say, so we can think that for one moment maybe is true; because for some people is important the what other people think about them so put this case and the table and start think why base on my experience i""m not going to say that is true but i can give you one reason that i think. Well is depent the who is the person because if is a boy who you like you wanna receive a good impression but if is not pass the time you or him can change the impression because now you alredy know the person the boy the point is the time why? because the first impression is a second but also you can change pass on time.

Second, the impression is how you look like or the expression on your face good we find another point because is other impression the we can change and you gonna think how well this is a situation before one year ago i was talk with a person and she look in the first mad, but she wasn't mad the face of her was express mad but she wans't pas the time more and more my so my first impression was the she was mad now i think the oppossed of her

The time is the words more important in the life that we can stop or pass and also we can forget because his live in our life but the impression is something the we can forget the we can pass and something the can't lived in us because is something that we can change is something that we can move.

In conclusion everything is based on time and if you ask me that if is a possible change the first impression i'm gonna say yes because you never going to forgot the first impression the you receive from other person but you can also change later and your mind or in your background. Always we can change something thanks for everything."

ALlthoug, some peoplesay it's bad idea because the student doesn't care any more about his school. Overall,some peoplesay it's good idea to student work in this time because you can save money from know until you be a man.

First,some peolple say it's bad idea. For example,the student when he see the money he will not care any more about school and his grade will go down and maybe he will repeted the year again. Student is bad to work beacause if he have friend they doesn't work and the guy who work see his friend not working and he just work they will have a big problem. However, is bad idea to student work know becausehe will not care any more about his high school.

Second,some people think is good idea to student in high school to work know. For example,when the student work from know and he save money he will come a man to go to colloge he will have a good money to go to the college,For example,student or other gay work's from they younger they can save a good money and when get like a man to get married they can look up the money and get it fast they can buy a house very fast and he doesn't get worried about the money. In adition,is good idea because the student can grow up and he will have a good money.

In conclusion, In some societies,student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. I think is good idea for me but is not a bad idea is good idea beacuse I can save money know and when I beacame a big man and my friend there reach and they want to travel to Generic_City I will say yes I can ,but is bad idea because if myfriend ask me and I don't have money I am can say no.

In societies, some people say to be a younger guy is good to work. Altough some people say is not a ggod idea to work because your can be tired. Overall,some people say it's nice idea to work because you can help your family.

First,some people say is bad idea beacause you will get tired. For example, if you work after school like from 4pm to 12am you will get tired and you leave far away you will have to sleep from 1am to 7am. Then you will have to wake up around 7am and go to school so your not can get to much of sleeping.

652,327EB11122D0,"Hello mi name is Generic_Name and my prompt is about ''Failure'' and ''Success.''

What i think about this?

The failure is a feeling so bad, when you have a bad day or something was wrong,your feel the person most useless. Yes, I agree with Churchill statement, because he have all the reason. Each person failure has a recompense and all the good what you do make and God give to you multiply.

We all have success why?,because everybody work so hard and they wish make all your dreams. In the personal, i think all start since down, when you everyday work hard your successful is each day more big and blessed,I have three reasons why i agree with this prompt.

My first reason:

Never say ''I can't'' because when you have a purpose you have to make,maybe many persons tell you ''forget it,you never can't this possible'' but you have to know when something is realize with the heart all is possible in this life never forget it.

My second reason:

Always you listen when somebody tell you something,because his advice can help you in the future and you can use the same advice for help other persons too. You need to be better every day for make a present and future so much better and be able to get what you wish.

My third reason:

If you not believe in who are you, you are in a big problem, the unique person can say what you can do or you can't not are you nobody else. In your life you have friends,teachers and you family is the most important in the world the people believe in you. Follow you dreams,follow you future, and always smile and when something was wrong, not feel bad,of course when you have a error you can learn and be a best person each day.

What is my point of view on this?

The life is so hard and beautiful,you can be wherever you want,follow you way and never stop,make the difference and never stop of dream. Be a nice person and do not even threat bad other people. Therefore, you never hands down when you see the past and now the present you can see what long you are, stay strong,be intelligent not lying and always say the true. When passed the time you can see all effort you dedicated,all is possible.

Detail Support:

My detail support is about the immigrant, this is a good example for this prompt,they came to United State for a better life,is very difficult and danger,because sometimes many persons died or have problems in the way, how much time is? honestly i dont know sometimes is one week,two weeks or more than of one month. When they finally here in United State is a new beginning is a new life,of course is so complicated and so sad,because is a new country and new culture y the most important the language is different.

The principal thing is learn talk, and writing in English. After this if you have your permission of work,you can star working in a restaurant o something you can learn fast and easy or if you are minor of age you need go to middle school or high school dependent what age do you have for after you can graduated. and attain a best work. This is so hard but not impossible,maybe you have many days bad,and you cry so much,but each sacrificed has its pay back.

Thank you for you patient and dedication for read this."
2219,A5567EF4C8EA,"I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected.

First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like.

Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career.

Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money.

In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help.              "
3877,FEA2C3FB45D1,"My first impressions was when i come in on this country. Because i did't know nothing me and my brother. We didi't know how are the think, or how work, we did't know how to speak the lenguage

But one day i say no more for everything no mero sad etc. And i say in my own i can do that to. Because I am a person, if the another people can do that, i can do that too. So my first step what i did to star. Was to learn the lenguage, because the lenguage is the most importenthing. Because you can deffend your self.

If you learn the lenguage you can do a lot thing.

Like for examplo you can go to the store, and buy something that you like,

or you can go to a restouran, and buy whatever you like of food etc. Another thing what you can do with the lenguage. Is to get a essy job, or you can meet a American friends. And had a normaly converseation.

For that i agree, that nothing is impossible because if i change my setuation you can change your i know that is not essy but not is impossible all of that is going to help you to overcome your self for that you has to nerver give up.               "
1721,8281058A7684,"Ralph Waldo once wrote,""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow.""I agree with this quote because of my experience learning another language like English it can be hard to learn English coming from a Hispanic family,and video gaming. Some may disagree with the quote because there is nothing else to learn .

When I was in first grade I came to school not knowing any English. Honestly I felt isolated because the language barrier I did not know what the teacher was telling me. All I said was ""Yes"" and ""No"" thats all I knew. I think it was a few weeks later that they call my parents . They notify my parents that

I was not doing well in school. My mother as always told me practice makes perfect. My mother with little bit of English that she knew she helped me to perfect it. Now, I could speak both languages fluently because of that effort I have more opportunities for a better job .

In Christmas the year 2017, I got the probably the best and worst gift of my life. It was an X box one at first felt happy because it was my second gaming console, but I did not know how to use it. It took me two weeks to understand the full operation. Then when I starting playing the first game that I bought was Fifa 18 by the way I did not pay for the game it was my dads credit card.

After that I downloaded Fortnite it was free so I didn't get in trouble . I found the games difficult , I started to practice a lot , then a few weeks later it became an addiction. I couldn't focus in school my grades were falling off where I had them before I got the X box one. My father told me if I did not get better grades he be forced to take away . So I started to focus on my grades ,but yet still thought the gaming console .

Some may disagree that what Ralph Waldo wrote. For example, if your'e a teacher you probably know what to teach for the semester. The job you have does not require that much only a master degree. Or being a car washer you just clean cars.

This has been all I have for this quote.       "
2192,A394468CDEC1,"Do you think getting advice from more that one person help you make a better decision? Yes I think getting advice from more than one person help's you make a better decision. First getting more than one advice from someone help's them make a better decision because they know what advice they need and what they don't need. Second receiving advice from more than one can make you combine all of the advice's together to make one big advice.

While getting advice from one person is great, Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial. Getting advice from more than one person is more profitable than getting it from only one person. Getting advice from more than one person can help you really think about the advice's people gave and you can benefit from the one's you understand. When you get the advice's from those people they want you keep it so you can use it in future. You can get advice from anyone but you have to understand the advice that will benefit you.

When you receive multiple advice's you can combine all their advice's to get one big advice that summarizes all the advice's you were given. When you get advice from someone it connects to things such as, School, Sports, Jobs,and many more. When you get advice it's to motivate your self to do more. When you get advice from more than one person it's usually something your good at. When those people talk about the same advice you have heard before it all connects together to make a big advice. The big advice you get from all the people that gave you advice's is to either improve or be successful.

I think getting advice from multiple people can help you make a great decision. First getting more than one advice can help know what advice is useful and what advice is not useful. Second you can a lot of advice from more than one person but you combine all the advice's you got into one big advice. Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial and it can help you come up with your on decision on what advice is good for you."
3741,F9069F051AD1,"I think an enjoyable educational activity for me is Gym. Because gym is the most fun class I have this year these are some examples of why I like gym. the first reason why I like gym is because during the warm up we are aloud to talk to our friends while we are walking. Also another reason why is when we finish doing our warm up we get to play games or do fun activities. the last reason why is we could also go outside to do games or activities when it is nice outside.

The first reason why I enjoy the beginning of gym is because you can walk around the gym and talk to your friends.

. And not have to wait to talk till lunch to talk all you want. But the main reason why I like that part of gym is because I love to talk even though at sometimes I got nothing to talk about. Another reason why is that I love hanging out with my friends or to hear about there problems. talking helps you feel much better and lonely so i think that talking is fun and important at the same time.

then the other reason why I like gym is because we get to play fun games or activities sometimes. Because I like getting distracted from stuff with something fun like a game or activities. The fun games could help someone feel relaxed and forget about something that might be worrying them. another reason why I like that is because l think it is much more fun than having to be in health, Doing the pacer or doing push ups. But other people do enjoy those stuff but I highly dislike doing those things. but the games could help you get some exercise and keep you having fun the gym class instead of being bored and exercising

The last and final reason why I like gym is because sometimes we go outside when the weather is nice to do activities or other stuff like that. I like going outside because I like it when it is nice and warm out to be doing exercise. It is also nice to be out there and be racing or playing soccer and maybe football. But it is also big outside to be holding all of the gym classes together and the teachers could teach together. And you could also do much more outside even though some people dont like going outside I think it is much better because their is much more space and more fresh air."
2131,9F7E189A2DCF,"Do you believe to know a person through one impression? Some people believe that most of the people's personality will depends on their presentation or the way that dress up, they think that your knowledge or your personality is base on how you look. I believe that the first Impression could change for the following three reasons; Your clothes or how you look do not show your type of personality, the kind of person who you are will depends on knowing the person and through knowing the person your idea about the person could change.

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are.

Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships that's why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are.

Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person.

To conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person that's why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person."
2545,BD4BFB4E8C6B,"Many will say that distance learning is a really good option for students. Several students will benefit from distance learning by having better attendance, less problems , and it will also help students with certain disabilities or health problems . On the other hand , some will disagree by saying that if students dont attend actual school they will become lazy and irresponsible. Distance learning will benefit many student and also school.

Distance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school. Having to wake up so early in the morning just to attend school for about eight hours will cause a student to become lazy and tired.

Unfortunately some student are born or are diagnosed a certain disability to where they cant attend school . However those students with disabilities have a right to have an education. Distance learning will really benefit those students by allowing them to attend school from home. There are many reasons why students benefit from distance learning but being able to help a child with a disability on their education is the most important reason.

If students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education. Schools will stop having so many bullying problems.

On the other hand many will disagree and say that if students stay at home and pursue their education there they will become irresponsible and lazy. Students should be allowed to attend school how they want to . If a students becomes lazy because of distance learning the problem is within the student. Many will agree that it will make a student less lazy and more responsible. "
1783,86ECF13FEDEF,"Why I disagree that first impression are almost likely to never change overtime? Well,In this world many people have experience bad,nice,and fake first impressions. Why because people have a bad feeling about you, you are not aware of what is happening in their heads, and maybe they just wanna take advantages of your personality or who you are.

One, First Impressions that I deal with everyday is give nice impressions with my friends. However, the person need to be interest on the topic you're talking about or just be goofy. People sometimes come up to you and smile and said hi or was sup because they know you're alone. If you wanna make new friends or have the respect that you want you only got to show them your nice impression. For Example: In the movie Everything,Everything the girl couldn't go outside because she could get sick,but the new neighbor his name is Generic_Name and he decided to smile and said hi through the window. She smile back to him and then she went to bed.

Two, I have experience bad impressions about people being rude for no reason. They bring a side of me that when they said bad stuff they think that I am going to stay quiet. I just give them the same energy back because nobody deserved to be treated on a bad way when you're trying to just said Hi or want a new friends. If your in pain or suffering don't take out your anger on others cause for a first impression you going to be looking like a bad guy. For Example: If a Hispanic kid decide to ask a person for the class room number and that person start to laugh in his face the Hispanic kid gonna feel oppress and feel bad. People don't realize that by first impressions you could win the whole world, but no people like to be hard and act childish.

Three,Fake Impressions make the person to take advantage of your opportunities and your personality. The person wants attention all the time but then start talking mess up things about you. I have experience people making fake impressions when they said Hi they look at you a certain way that you know is wrong. Fake Impression led you to think that the other person is talking behind your back. The person pretends to like you, but in particular the person don't care about your feelings or the friendship. For Example: My Ex BFF a year before we stop talking we meet and is was fun, but until I left to VA she decide to not care for me,text me, or call me. That hurt me so much that months past by an you even feel better without that friend because since the begging she was giving me fake impressions and I didnt catch on.

In conclusion, Sometimes you need to calm down before to start speaking to a person. Be nice and never let negative thoughts on your mind that are going to make you look bad. Let people talk to you first and then think about their first impression. I been nice, but sometimes I gotta get mad with people cause they don't even know you and start calling you names but is not worth it to think about that cause that said a lot about their first impressions. First Impressions will never change cause once you speak whatever come out your mouth is gonna stick to that person forever. You know that you when accomplish somebody smile or laugh that's everything to them is important that is their first reaction and by First Impression you can win the world by been nice all the time and make new friends or win the respect that you deserve or them."

what you have already mastered ,those people they don't bealive they don't grow up ,that is not true we have to create a new things improve us self we don't like to stay the same place and nothing is imposible.

I'm agree with Emerson's statement what I already know that's a adventage for us . because it is easy doing something what we have already know ,but if we never try it , and we never know if we can do it, I need improve my self and switch my position that's a new goal . so many people they do not bealive them self , well we born poor people , so nothing is imposible ,trying what we want to do in the life . with the time we can get , and reach what we always dreaming.

You will never grow up , if you doing the same things in the life there is I lot opportunity in the world choose a new goal you will see so many change on your way don't give up.

It's easy doing what I already know because we feel comfortable doing ,for example on my work , I'm working busboy helping the server we working team work ,and easy but the problem is want to be a server but they never let me to try it i want to grow up swith a position to earn more money.

Creater a new things , we have so many skill to grow up don't be afraid doing or tying new things we want to improve us self I don't like to stay the same place doing the same things I don't see any improve on my life your life can be change a week but you have to be a positive ,don't give up , try it, isn't nothing bad."
2423,B403A4E28BCE,"Why do we need to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? Why can't we make our own decisions? It's because the adults knows what's best for their kids and they been through everything that we are experiencing right now as a teenagers. Or is it because they would like to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know what's best for us, we can learn from our mistake, and we want to be more independent.

First, when we do something bad and get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. For example, I had a friend and she decided to go to a party and I told her not to go because it's always a fight. Well she went and ended up getting hit in her face. I tried and warned her but she make her own decisions and I wanted her to make her own decisions so I let her go. Now she doesn't go to parties anymore.

Then, we know what's best for us. If we know something we're doing is wrong but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldn't make fun of us or we want to be ""cool"". But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hang out with. Knowing they are bad but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen or they get you in trouble just so you can fit into the group. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place.

Last, we don't listen our parents or any adults telling us what's right and what's wrong. we would want to figure things out by ourselves and be more independent.

We know when they telling us that we shouldn't do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. But we know what we're doing ( well at least some of us know). Sometime we don't tell our parents what's going on at school or on social media but somehow they find out whats going on with us. We sometimes try to hide the problem and solve it our selves but it doesn't go well.

In conclusion, teenagers today will want to do everything and not listening to the adults. When we get older and start to understand why we did all those crazy and nonsense stuff in high school or middle school, like fighting (knowing it's not going to solve the problem), making fun of other people (knowing that's not how we would like to be treated), and smoking (knowing it's bad for our lungs). We just wanted to be like everybody else"". But,

at the end of the day we learn from our mistake and become a better person in life. "
1625,7B5BC2343286,"In some Societies, students are expecting to identify a career by the time they enter to high school,Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific careers and take the classes they need for the career to practices more and be more specific in the career and have more thinks to know how it work for them, in some career they need a lot of think to try it and they need practice to be in high level of the career and at young age they are expecting what career they want to take when they get older and get to high school.

I think that's good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some career are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it work to get better practice in the career because some career are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers and they talk about it and it work.

When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many career and they talk to the teacher whats better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. and when they get age when they have take classes for the career they getting more ideas about the career.

By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career,

before they get to high school, they trying to be better in every classes they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything.

Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are think what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college.

I think that's a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they gonna take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they wanna be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.

suddenly she cross the final line ; Everyone was screaming from joy. Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons.

For example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers.

Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when

Generic_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.

Generic_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream. Some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future, although its going to help you in the future in many ways . For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers don't like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do. Know you can decide what do you want to do after school.

I like the idea for students to participate in an extracurricular activities because students will have an activity to do after school and the will spend more time with there friends. If there is a student that don't have any friends this will help them make friends and learn new things. Teenagers should do at least one sport or participate in other activities for their own good.

1420,6CE97E45BF79,"The past decades technology has been advancing and helping humans to achieve goals that looked hard to accomplish. Although some people say that technology have a negative effect on peoples lives because technology is making people to not socialize, actually technology helps the people to communicate with others that are far away and technology makes people's lives easier.

The people who said that technology has a negative effect on people's lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media.

However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls.

Also, technology makes people's lives easier because you can shop via internet, complete your work, and plan projects. Technology gives people an advantage to have an life without stress. In other works technology helps people to have better life. Thanks to technology we have the access to success in our lives.

In conclusion, Technology helps us all to have a better life and to have better communication with people we dont often see. dont you agree that technology makes our lives easier?

1269,615FAEE4F8EF,"School should not extend the school days more than eight hours. Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study. Others think that An 8 hours of school time is enough time to study every day. This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good.

Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.

Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active.

Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work.

School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time. Studing and teaching requieres focus and creativity but when students and teachers get tired all that is missing."

Its way better telling people the things that happen so you can get there view because you might not see it the way they do. When you tell more people you get more advice and thats good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice and you take it and try it and it works so it made you feel it better but thats only one advice they gave from all your friends so there is still a bit more. So you day got better. An yes i understand sometimes you don't want to share your stuff with people so you just have one friend you tell everything to and they help with everything they listen,give back what they think. An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice. It's your choice on what pick.

But i still asking people for some advice is better because like i said earlier they give more advice, They will give there option and tell if if your in the right or wrong.

some people disagree because anyone can change there impression anytime. Like when have you seen someone impression the same when they gift them a toy then when they give them a book. Some people will agree that impressions dont change but you can fake your impression anytime.

other people will agree because some people can show the same impression anytime. there wrong because no one cant have the same impression everyday. Some people fake a smile every day and when they get home there down and crying a lot. other people that agree that people can have the same impressionthey gotta look at it from another point of view.

3340,E7510A2A4F0A,I disagree with this statement because you are supposed to have knowledge imagination is like dreaming but when you have knowledge you can put your mind to something to create something big in the future like having your own company and you can signed workers and to make them delivered stuff to people and all of this is reality even though you need to finish school and go to college and get a degree there it take time you have to get your mind set and encourage your self to do better. You can also help people if they need help on something cause you already been threw all of this like how to get a job or how to make your own job and to encourage somebody else to just put there mind to it so that person that you helped they can also helped somebody then it goes own forever and forever and you can tell them how you succeed in they can follow in your foot step and they can tell another person who they succeed and they can tell there story imagination isnt reality it is when you are sleeping or thinking but knowledge you will need it if you are in a situation.
2677,C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are.

Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldn't get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude.

Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didn't like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didn't want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didn't take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldn't because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you don't know them.

First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are.

Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change.

Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think it's a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change.

In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?"
1555,777CB894A285,"I believe on what Mr. Emerson said about being a master at something but not growing. In my experience In working In construction I learned how to measure wood, cut wood, and Install wood frames and all of that taught me how to be a more efficient person at my job. It also taught me how to use power tools and utilitys and for me I think it's better to know how to do different things like how to change the oil from your car or how to fix something that went wrong In your car like If something went wrong with your engine or If some hoses came loose. I believe If a person just want to know one thing and be great at It that's their right and that is acceptable, but they will be only focusing on one thing. But It's alright because not everyone would have the time or just would'nt want to do It. So I think it great If someone has already mastered something that they really like doing, but I believe it better to know many different things like construction or car mechanic or how to connect electricity wires because I truly believe that knowing many different things can give you more knowledge for the future."
1738,8397368B57EA,"Do you think being in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is a good thing? I think it can be bad.

When you are trying to accomplish things and make friends, it can get you hated. First off when you open up to people and be honest with them, they aren't going to like it and turn on you and hate you. when they see you succeeding and doing better than they are, they will talk about you because they arent where you are and they will make you try to feel down and unsuccessful.

When trying to do good things in life people will down really low to the point where you give up, and just try to fit in and do bad thing that could lead you down a wrong path, to where you can end up in prison or dead you can end up in the wrong crowd, when you thought they were good people. They will manipulate you at first thinking they are good people and want to see you accomplish being thing in life. Once you get to know them and see who they really are you will see the complete opposite and it could be too late to turn back.

In conclusion whether you try to be your self and accomplish your goal there will always be people who will hate you and bring you down with them. No matter how much you try you will end up falling because of being yourself and choosing the wrong crowd."
1662,7E48A7A7B400,"When I was in elementary school, I've always wanted to have art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work.

In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. Art would help them in life and school. It would help their future. This is why I would like to share this lesson with them."
1397,6BB4BEB51A80,"People can learn without making mistakes. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important. People should not make their own decision. First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake.           "
3136,DD279F25DC1F,"""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help.

First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas.

Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family.

Second, students can have more time to do their homework. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework.

Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework.

Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of test's coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did.

Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore.

Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework.

Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week."
1038,4F6A4668D513,"The character is the way how you act or behave, and I think that you can form your own character and you can choose your own character traits, no one can influence in what your character or personality is. However some people may think that your character can be influence by which you interact with (like parents), and your personality is based in others personality.

You choose what you want it to be, no one can choose your own way, or in this case your character, is primordial that you choose your own traits, if you don't do that then you'll be un-secure of your self and that can carry many problems to distinguish who you are, or where you should go in life.

Have your own character is a big thing to have, because many people can imitated others character or personality from their parents or any famous person, but if you have you own character that means that you are unique. A recent study in the University of Virginia shows that people who choose their own character and their own way to act, or behave, they are happiest than the ones that imitated other people personality.

You are your owner, your are only yours! Since you are a baby you start forming your character or personality, you have control of what you want to be or what you want it to do. But some people will argue that your parents are whom form your character and they chose your personality traits, but that is not true, your character is formed by your own experiences in life, as Jonh lubbock wrote ""Your character will be what your self yoose to make it.""

In conclusion, you can be whoever you want, your character will be formed by you based in your experiences in life, no one can choose what your character or personality will be. People will always judge you, but You always must do do what your heart tells you to do, be always happy with your own personality or character, and don't let people choose how you will act (not even your parents), make your own character and act in the rigth way.

3569,F1883C3A8C1E,"It has been said that having a positive attitude is the key to success life. I agree but at the same time i disagree. First being positive can bring success in life we so many great people who found the key to success in being positive like Micheal Jordan. He was cut from his varsity basketball team but him being positive and putting in work help he found the key to success in his life.

Next my second reason i think being positive can be the key to success is. Da Baby he was always told we wasn't every going to be anything but had stayed humble and positive and keep his head up and now he is one of the top rappers of are time now. he has multiple gold and platinum records and he has millions of fans and followers he has people who want to see him because he stayed positive and found his key to success.

last i disagree because having a positive attitude isnt always the key to success because when the people out in war doesnt have a positive attitude because they have to be ready for the enemy and i think you wouldnt want to have a positive mind set in that predicament. In conclusion being positive can sometimes be the key to life and sometimes not having a positive attitude can still be the key to life."
778,3C56844D4CF0,"Many students become involved in extracurricular activities enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to or complete homework assignments. In my opinion it would be better if the school has controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities. Therefore, school offer the capacity that students have to develop their potential. Secondly, school count by with the necessary tools that students needed. Thirdly, school helped the students a level physical with the sports. If the school simplify by pushing the controls and the extracurricular activities for the students, their are more productive at school and teaching-learning process undoubtedly be win-win for all the participants involved in this activities.

The first reason that support the school has a controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities, is school offer the capacity that students have to develop their potential some students to take advantage of the opportunities, while that some students their classes seems boring. For example, I don't have any idea that the biology class was a interesting class, because I was observing the animals, plants, bacteria, and human body, biology is a wonderful class in this class I learn the importance that have the activities in the school. Therefore, everything was I learn because the schools offer to me the capacity to develop me potential.

The second reason the school has a controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities. If school count with the necessary tools that students needed, research has shown that teenagers experience with the school has a control with the students. For example, the school count with the books, computers, and different classes, and with everything that a students needed to their life , this statement helped to students go to different schools. Some instruments has the ability to change the students attitude and impact everyone and should be strongly considered.

The last reason to support the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities, is school helped the students a level physical with the sports. Some schools helped the students to have the best level the sports and to make the dreams to paying. For example, my youngest brother playing in soccer team this is good for him, and he says me everything in the team is wonderful and is a inspiration for him because he has a the most wonderfully experiences in the sports. Students can be more productive at school and in their activities, because the schools bring the opportunity to parctice some sport.

I truly believer that having the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities can be more would better is the right step towards a more convenient and enjoyable educational experience, and considered that schools offered the potential that students have to developed their potential, by and large school count with the necessary instruments that students needed, lastly school helped the students a level physical with the sports, I hope my voice get heard to the schools and their make this issues, schools can be more productive if their has the control with the students."
1373,69C15737269C,"We can't remove the impressions of the mind, and neither to change the impressions, Never again forget my first impressions, I can't change the last in my life, I remember the impressions in my life, when i was a children my mom, she also say: ""You have good impressions and bad impressions but remember, you learn new things with impressions of the life"" Would i like to change some impression, I have memory very bad, but i know it impossible my first impressions it was very painful, my mom and my father could have divorce, my life to change, it was my first impressions, but now I understand, the older people sometimes don't know the concequence, My second impressions it was when my uncle say: You want go to USA, that's moment was very happy, because i wanted to live in USA, always to change my life in my country, this is a good memory, all problem life's are necesary because we can to learn new things for the life, My last impressions it was the death of my best friend in my contry Guatemala, it was very impressions because he has a stranger disease, it was a moment very painful for me ever since my life is different

My position for this topic is, we don't change the last impressions, but we can change the impressions of future, to learn and understood the last things is a good reason for continue the life"
745,39524C93F4D4,"People will tell you that without doing something, you'll never get what you want. I agree. Accomplishing something is a great feeling when you know you've done it because when you know you put in the time and effort for it and get a great result. It shows that the time you toke to make it was worth it. Sitting around, letting people hand you stuff will get you no where in life, because instead of you doing something, you wait for them to give it to you, not aware of what that person had to do to.

What does it mean to accomplish something? To me accomplishing something is when you worked hard for what you did and you're satisfied with your result. That to me is accomplishing something. Whenever I set my mind to anything, I do whatever it takes to make it. For example, I had a championship finals in a week and I needed time to prepare my mind and body for the game. The time came to play the game and all I could think about was winning that trophy. We ended up winning, and I won what I was waiting to accomplish. I don't think I could have made it if I didn't make an dedicate my time to win the finals.

Kids nowadays are spoiled by there parents to get whatever they want just by asking. I can understand that some parents care about what the needs of there own children, but I often see parents buy usless things for there kids and that can be a problem because when they know they can get these things that aren't any use for them,

they go asking for other stuff that they don't need. A solution to this problem can be when they are old enough to get a job, to get one so they can make money, so they can buy things for them selves. Instead of leaching on Mommy and Daddy's money all the time. Getting a job shows that you're doing something to get what you want, for example, a house, a car, anything you can spend you're own money that you need. The effort you showed got to where you are and now you know you accomplished it.

A person I know that has accomplished alot in his life is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a soccer athlete and was born in a small town in Portugal. Like others there, his family was really poor and couldn't afford him anything really. He was a trouble child in school and misbehaved when things didn't go his way. He was very talented in soccer though. He would go outside, find anything round and did whatever he would do to a real soccer ball. He was noticed by coaches when they would here a young kid scoring goals not any normal kid would. He moved to the capital of Portugal and would play for the towns Division one team. He never forgot his family back home. He would have made a ton of money to send back to his family and bought them a house in a much nicer and safer location. His goal was to be the best player in all of soccer. He worked in and out of practices to get better and play for a club that people would notice that he was. He was bought by one of the greatest teams in all of europe Real Madrid. He was the most highest paid athlete at the time and whenever he got his pay check, he would always use it for a good cause like, family, charity, etc. He would eventually be nominated for the best player award five times and would end up winning those times. He accomplished what he had dreamt of becoming, and I hope people could see his story and realize you can't just sit around and do nothing, you have to put in time and effort to get what you want.

I can understand when people can get lazy and not do anything to accomplish anything. Not everyone is perfect. But sooner or later they'll realize that without doing something, you can't get what you want. Sometimes people are fortunate to recieve things just by asking, but do you want to live a life leaching off people? Letting them know ""oh this person can't live without me because I get him everything"" I know I wouldn't. I hope to accomplish here that, you have to make an effort in order to accomplish something.

1691,80C0814AF16D,"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school.

First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I don't start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students won't know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and that's how I would like to express myself through my career.

Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didn't start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didn't start at a young age, if I started at school then there won't be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I don't have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career.

Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and that's my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name      "
1171,5AAD796F4D6B,"Why having a good attitude tours someone can have good causes. Having a good attitude tours someone you just meet, can bring good actions like a great friendship or relationship, a reason for a person that wants to hang out with you is because that person thinks your great person and they would like to spend more time with you because you give them a good impression to them and they think your a great person.

For example, lets say your mate wants you to meet his or her parents, so to give them a good impression you would have to, have a good attitude tours everything they say in order to give a good impression to them. another example can be work, having a good attitude at work can be a lot less stressful and more positive in your life and others coworkers because your not complaining of how difficult your day was, they have it difficult too, but maybe not having so much stress in your mind or complaining how life is treats you, you can even hang out with your friends or your coworkers time to time and make new friends or people like you even little more because at the end of the day everything would still be the same so be more positive. So having a good attitude tours your friends, family or coworkers can lead to positive outcomes."
847,410957337087,"Distance learning

In century twenty-first the education in United states and another countries became better that before thanks to technology. Moreover, the technology helps schools to teach their students with a better way. Now, classes are created creative and effective. The schools had been creating different programs such as ""Distance learning"" to offer a different option to students. This is a program that help students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Therefore, there is a question that every body is making Is the distance learning a better option?.

As all programs, it has many advantages. The benefits of this program are following: Anytime class: you do not need to wake up very early in morning, you will be able to attend classes anytime that you consider best. No drive: you do not need drive to school or anywhere, you will skip the traffic. Comfortable: it will be comfortable, because you will stay in the comfort of your house. Work and study: you will be able to work and study at same time, because you can attend classes anytime that you want. No bullying: you do not have to suffer bullying from anybody in school anymore. Focus: you will be focus in class, because you will be alone in your house without company.

it also has disadvantages such as no teachers: you do not have any teacher with experience around of you. if you have a question, you can not ask to some else. Sociable life: you will lost a sociable life in school, because you will stay in home. No books: you do not have all the books to study. Depression: you will pass for a depression that could be caused from being locked in home.

Well, is the distance learning a better option?. In conclusion, in my personal opinion it is. I think that this types of programs will be useful and success. There are many peoples that needed programs as this, because they does not have full time to go to school. Those people that need work and study at same time, because they do not have all the resources or money. This programs was created for all you, people that can not go to school. At end if you want to join to a programs as this, it up to you."
1875,8D1CD79C0F8D,"Thomas Jefferson once said ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I was so successful in life. You want to know why? it was because I was always keeping myself busy with work. We accomplish more if we are always doing something because you get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy.

First, you get more work done, for example I had a science project due in one month and I decided to get working on it until I had finished it, consequently I had more time to work on my other school work. My friend, Generic_Name she is always working at McDonalds and she never takes any days off. She refuses to stay home and be lazy, therefore you will always see her working on something productive. It could be school work, her job, or anything else that benefits her. Generic_Name had a book project to do and since she was always working she accomplished more than her friend, Generic_Name.

Secondly, you can be more successful, for example my cousin, Generic_Name was always exploring with cars until he found out he wanted mechanic to be his major. Since he knows a lot about cars he can always help people when their cars break down and can also make money that way. Generic_Name can later on open his own mechanic shop in the future. My friend, Generic_Name has also been very successful. She absolutely loves doing makeup on her and on other people. Generic_Name's makeup looks are so amazing she has become a famous makeup artist. I also became successful when I opened up my baleada shop. Every one loved the taste of my homemade tortillas filled with beans, eggs, avocado, and cheese.

Finally, you can be more healthy, for example I go out to run each morning instead of sleeping in. Running outside in the morning can be very healthy because you are stretching your muscles to start the day. Although some people may think inactivity serves a purpose, they are incorrect because inactivity can be unhealthy. My friend, Generic_Name got in shape because he goes to Golds Gym every day after work. He rather go to the gym on his free days instead of staying home watching Naruto because that will not benefit him.

You can get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy when you accomplish more if you are always doing something. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and I benefited from always doing something productive instead of being inactive. Help me spread the word that always doing something is more beneficial and healthy than being inactive."
1431,6D8B9B8431A6,"It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you don't want to do any homework. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . Although some say working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information and work fast.

Some say that working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we don't need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. That day my group and I talked where to see each other, then we went to Generic_Name's house. We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. All I can say, we all just waste our time.

However, working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information. It is true that many heads think better than one because if one comes with an idea then all together discuss about it. Furthermore, some child think better if one person gives them an idea. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what I'm thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. Working alone doesn't help in answering doubt that we could have.

Also, working with a group is a great benefit because we can work fast. All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. It means that working with a group is a great benefit, it help us to have better thoughts.

Working with a group can bring joy to our soul by making new friends. We can work and have fun, also working with a team is great because we can talk not just about the project, but our lives. Moreover, a group work can make learning more passionate.

In conclusion, working alone is beneficial because it can save our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because all the group can share information and that can bring a faster work. Thank you for taking your time to read my paper, I hope you understand why I prefer working with a group."
746,39776B3A4C70,"Dear, Generic_School.

For some of the students, school is really far away for them, some student arent able to be in school for there health issues or gifted youngsters, is a really wonderful thing that the schools are offering online classes for the kids, it can really be a big help for there parents and there children.

My aunt, she has two children and one of them is gifted she can't walk normally, my aunt works everyday and is really frustrated , she has to take her to school everyday in the morning and take her home in the afternoon, from there home to school is like a 30 minutes of a ride and the way back , there is no bus able to take her where she lives , during the winter she wasn't a fan of the cold, the kid mostly feel sick during winter season, during at that time every morning they go outside to the car so my aunt can drop her to school she always felt sick, she was not able to attend school normally, it is really hard for my aunt, i told my aunt about the offer that the school are gonna make, about the online school and she really supports that decision she told me "" That would it be a wonderful thing for me and my child"" she is really joyful about the offer that the schools are making,

I fully do support this offer, from the schools having online classes it does help a lot of kids and parents, with they struggles and timing at home, it will be a big help for the counties of Generic_City, we want all the kids to learn at same time so they can be prepare for there future.

Thank you for your time.

2210,A4CD4307D620,"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.

Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. You'd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesn't blow up on you. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.

Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.

All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

2780,CBCA3CFF320B,"Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible."

1427,6D41FAC8F3CF,"The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,"" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyway.

I'm disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody have to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, bacause alot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessent to the people.

To many time the comunity try to change your descision and they do not respect what you said. that's why is alot problem in the poblation. Example; to much politician people want to change customs and religions they can't do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture.

If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and don't peatention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work.

The reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say. The solution to this problem is do what you thing is right; and the comunty need to have a good relationship families,neightborhood, and students.    "
507,2675A97C2B76,"Do you think being hounst at all times is a good thing? I agree with people who are hounst at all times because they don't lie and lieing can cause a lot of problems. No matter how old you are being hounst is a very good thing for kids, adualts and teenagers. I think you should be hounst at all times because if you'er not hounst people wont trust you, and people can come to you for advice, it also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst.

If you are not hounst people wont trust you. Most people want to be trusted. People want to be trusted in a relationship, friendship and a parentship and most importantly you would want to be trusted in your family. Being hounst whould make people trust in you in many ways. However, you can be trusted be not lieing or makeing fake roumers. For example a girl in our school whould make up roumers and lie about an eight th grader. Therefore, after doing all that no one wanted to be her friend because they could'nt trust her.

If you are hounst at all time people can come to you for advice. If your hounst your friends, sisters, classmates will come to you for advice because they would know you would have great ones. Mostimportantly they would trust you because you'er hounst and they will tell you everything and ask for advice and you will tell them what sounds good and hounst .Therefore, if you hounst you can be trusted by good advice that might actully help that person.

Being hounst also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst. Having trust issues can com from being dishounst and if you'er dishounst with someone it really makes that person think that they can't trust anyone at all. Thats because they have been broke by that other person who keeps lieing. That shows me that being hounst is an amazing thing that everyone chould have.

In summary being hounst is good for everyone .It could be hard for some people but you always have to remember you have to be hounst so, people could trust you, people could come to you for advice, it helps people with trust issues know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst."
3106,DC099826F469,"People is always trying to make you be someone else or follow new tendences ,especially in this time everyone is trying to have the same haircut,color hair,or body. A lot people is afraid to be themselves which is mean show to the world who they really are. For these and many reasons is why i am agree with Emerson's statement because if you obtain to be yourself you are gonna be unique,you are gonna follow your dreams,and you are gonna be confident.

Everyone is trying to do the same things that someones else does, but imagine being unique you would be different from other people you would play or practice any sports that you want. You can get your own style use or create your own clothes, and start to use your imagination. You do not have to be worry for follow any fashion because you would have your own sunshine.

Dreams? I am pretty sure that you have dreams like I do, but my dreams migth be differents from yours, probably you want to be a doctor and i want to be a singer. However if you get to find yourself you are follow your owns dreams you will be more happy that anyone else doing the things that you love. You are gonna enjoy your life every single day, every moment ,and everywhere. You alwalys are gonna get the positive side of the things even in your bad days because you are gonna love what you have and what you do.

In this time be confident is something really hard for many people but if you are a confident person you will not care about what people say, which is mean you are not gonna care about they opinions because you will be focus in your goals .You will belief in yourself, in your decisions do not matter what will happen. You will be an example for many people who does not felling in the same way that you do and you migth inspire them to follow their dreams.

In conclusion be yourself does not matter what people say or what they want for you,live your own life because life is only one. Get your own goals ,and do not try to be like someone else, do not follow their style because if you do not be yourself ,you are never ever gonna be happy with your life and you will not get all the things that you want in your future. Get your own sunshine just try it, it is inside of you and it is waiting for you ,Love and be yourself.                      "
1196,5CA2DCC616C6,"Energy had become the most usable thing in the world; without energy students couldn't be able to find information for their homework or projects. In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend.

To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information.

Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school.

Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend. Students would also adapt to find information in books. In conclusion, if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school, would be helpful to conserve energy and resources."
121,092BBD374359,"""Hey I had fun reading this book with you"" , younger student said. Kids especially younger ones love the older students because they make everything cool and fun. Since some schools have a program where they pair up a younger and older student together to help both of them. The program could help both of them learn something cool, interesting and the older ones can learn how to assist a kid and could share different opinion that they can't share front of the teacher about learning.

One way the program can help both younger and older student is by. They both can learn about something they have never learned or what they young want to learn about. Younger kids can teach the older ones how to say different stuff that they are learning. The older can each them what they are learning in class. This could be a mini deal that both have with each other and it could help.

Another way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The older ones are almost ready for job. He could learn more about how to control a kid and teach them or assist them. The younger kid could tell them ways and teach them. This could lead to a good bounding with older students. I think they would see each other after years and be like I know who you are you were the one who assisted me.

Last way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The feeling a student has is like why are we doing this. Is this even related to anything. They would able to give there opinion what they think about the topic or subject. Mostly students are shy front of class, but that would be only person to person, they won't be shy. This could help the students explain there self. I think it would make both of them feel comfortable.

I think this program would help alot of the students confident to talk to people and learn in a fun way. This help alot of people I

am one of them. When I was in 6th grade I was a reading, so I read books with my reading buddies it was fun. You get help in subject you need help in it makes everything easy. This program could help you in different problems you have. It will incourage you to learn more, so you can tell your helper.  "
1952,93575D076743,"Dear Principal,

The reason why I'm writing you this letter is because, I would like your students and all your school to help us to do a perform community service.

All the schools are planning to do one in their community because the state weather its not so good in the communities, because of the contamination of the fabrics and cars, its better for the students and teachers to do a community service because that way we can have a better life without contamination and another way that helps is that we can have a better health. Those are my reasons to do a perform community and, I will like your school to participate with us on having a clean area to live in.

Thank you"
3380,E8E07D453C9B,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks, without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives. I believe that technology had positive effects on people's lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends.

The first reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we can't talk with our families that are in long distance. And we don't know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. That's why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because it's important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you can't go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you can't come today, if there was no technology it wasn't possible to do these things.

Second reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However that's good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you can't drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money.

Third reason is that technology had positive effects on people's lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you don't know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you can't ask question because you don't know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you can't talk or ask them for help. That's when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator.

Technology had positive effects on people's lives technology helps people with more stuff, and they can use technology as a useful thing we use technology for everything."
206,0F7DB6BD1AD5,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done.

students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking.

students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases.

students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time.

Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise.         "
1696,80DB9AB00E74,"i would take the offer of finish high school early and stay after school because they giving a chance to finish early so you might just take it you get to go to college early and probably get a full time job get you're own money and not worry about not having money no more.

It is a good idea because some people would like to finish early then late some of them would rether get a job then come to school but you need education to get a good job and be succsesfull in life and a better job gets you good money for the people that like to spent money on clothes and stuffs like that

A lot of kids dropping out ofschool why because like i said they rather get a job then go school but you need school to get a good job but they giving you the oportunity to graduate early but some kids just guve up on school and drop out of school but i would take the oportunity to finish school early so i can be succesfull in life and have a better life and not worry about not having money.

But some students wouldnt like to come during summer or after school so they would have to ask all the studets so they can agree to see what they prefer to do like just take the classes the you really need for graduation insted oftaking classes that you dont need for graduation so they wouldnt have to stay after school or come during summer "
3509,EF4966D17FFB,"Eating healthy food is good for our health. People can also live longer eating healthy food in their life, and eating same food everyday can also be bad for our health. Taking this situation our school principal should change our lunch to healthier food because students will not get bored eating same lunch everyday, students will stay healthy, and students will have new experience.

Students at school are getting tired eating same meal every day. If our school principle change to the healthy lunch, students at school will be so proud trying new food, but some students who have their favorite cafeteria food they might have to get their food from home or try new healthy food at school.

Students will stay healthy from eating healthy food. Eating same lunch everyday can be very dangerous in our life. Students are getting sick everyday and have to struggle with disease like food poison, vomiting, and so on. Changing school cafeteria food to healthy food can help many students stay healthy. Over the past years many people have died eating same meal everyday, and that's what we are doing here at school ""eating same lunch every single day"".

Students who had never tried healthy food like salad, vegetable, apple and so on. For those students it will be fun experience and also some students love to try new things. Students who have their favorite food in school cafeteria, they can try new food once. Students might like those new food and be their favorite food.

Eating healthy food is one of the great thing to do to satay healthy. If our school principal many people would like the food. And eating healthy food or trying new food have many advantage like stay healthy, new experience, and they will not get bored with same lunch everyday.

i was not able to speak English, and every time i went out to play or go to school people were showing me examples of what to do or where to do same for me if i want to go play soccer or go to the play ground ill point outside the window or draw a picture of it, i tried to come up with anther way to example what i want but examples was the only think avalibel for me until i learned English.

Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because,thats the only way others will figure out what you talking about examples is what everyone use to help each other to also understand each other however,others say that example is not the mine thing to influencing other because, there are many other things to influence others for example, Google translator,Google,YouTube there is a lot of other apps that help to influence others.

i agree that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others; it is the only thing because , example is used every where and most of the time even when you want to speak to someone with another language and also kids see adult people as an example too them they see what they do and copy them example is used with everything for ex, for parents if they want there kid to be good they got to be an example of them or they have to show them an example of something or someone how to be behavior is one of the most important things because it show others hot to act and it it gives other people example of how to act in a sernat place for ex,if a kid go to a library and see tow adult being loud and playing around he going to do the same because he think that they doing the right thing because they are adult and should know how to act in place like that .

wall others say that Example is not the mine thing in influencing others because there are more thing that we can influence each others with technology made a lot for us that we can help and influence each other with other ways for ex, Google translator if i go to another country i dont need to show people examples of a museum or draw i can type it and show them or say it to them and they will give me direction and students that dont speak English can use a dictionary or Google to help them understand.

269,136F4548CFD0,"Some students think that summer break is good for students because its long break and students always like a long break so they can spend time with there friends . Actually, i think that there should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall because students get bored to doing same think like a study so and they can have more rest.

Some students think that students should get a summer long break because its long break and students always enjoy long break . If students get long break and there parents are not in the country where student living s so they can go to out of country for example; they can go to there hometown country to meet there parents, friends and relatives.

I think students should get a year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall because if the students keep coming school without break so they will be more stressful to doing some think again and again without break. Also,

Also, if students have a year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall so they will get a short - short break so they will be don't have so much load in there brains. Moreover, after a long break students don't like to come school so shorts break are better than long breaks.

Finally, i think a year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall is a good idea because students get bored to doing same think like a study so and they can have more rest. Also, after a long break students don't like to come school and they get more lazy, so shorts break are better than long breaks.  "
2719,C85795794D51,"Forty-five percent of people in the world enjoy doing outdoor activities. Something like going to community parks, state parks, and even national parks. The other percentage of people are indoors sleeping, watching TV, or playing video games. I personally can do both, there are other days when I just want to stay in the house and there are other days when I want to get out the house and do things like playing soccer with my brother and father. Enjoyable ways to spend you time outdoors can be going to festivals hanging out with friend or even reading a book in the park.

Some interesting and enjoyable outdoor activities that I like doing is going to the zoo, going on a picnic, hanging out with friends and family, playing some type of sport, or visiting a amusement park. Away that I would spend my time outdoors is hanging out with family and friends. By doing that I can go to the zoo with friends or go to a park and play sports with them. There are many thing you can do you just have to find the right activity the you like and enjoy. Another activity that I enjoy is playing soccer with

my dad and brother we always go to the park and play with my cousin then after that we would go out to eat and its better than sitting home all day and doing nothing.

These activities can be enjoyable because you together with family and friends and that can make things fun. People can use these activities to take their minds off certain situation like problem at home or something going on at school . People can use going to the park and reading a book as an escape of reality and life and going into their imagination. There are many reason why these activities can be enjoyable. Just sitting home all day doing nothing can cause you to be lazy and hide away from the world but also going outside is good for you mental growth. My mother has always told my sibings and I that we should go outside more often and I think to myself why is it important for us to go outside if there are more problems in the world the being indoors.

I think that being outdoors can help you open you mind up more to new things and experiences. For example my friend PROPER_NAME had skin cancer and he was so scared of being out side and he wanted to hangout with his friends, play sports, and go to the park and have picnic. This story is what motivates me to go out side because I dont want the freedom of going outside to be taken away.

everyone like a little bit of fun for example last week me and my friend went bowling and then we went to the mall it was pretty enjoyable because I forget about everything and focus on myself and the people I am with. I find it interesting the when we were younger we loved being outdoors playing with our friend and now that we are older and have electronics we decide to stay inside because its more entertaining. In conclusion, there are many enjoyable things to do outdoors you just have to find the right activity that suites you or maybe even try new things do to by yourself or find someone to do it with.

135,0AAD73A0AA91,"I think working in a group is more efficiently and helpful then working alone. In these paper i will argue about the benefice of working in a group. Working in group is better because we can share ideas, prepare us for the real world, and save time.

If we work in groups, we can share information, ideas and thoughts. We can see what its better for our teamwork and the assignment that we were doing in school or jobs. I think the most of the jobs in the real world are in groups, however, when i work in the mechanic shop with my dad and brothers, an i'm replacing a engine, i need their help because it takes strange, agility and experience to replaced it, because it's really hard for only one person to do it, so it's important to learn how to work in group, these skills prepare and help us for the real world by working like a team or family group. The army, police officer and government are some good examples of groups, they work together to finish their work and see the benefices of working in group. Doing work as a team is not a waste of time, we share the responsibilities,so it would not be the much work for only one person. Two or more people is a good combination of beneficial and fast work.

some say that working alone is better then working in group, but they wrong because when we work in groups is more easy by sharing thought with friend and partners, we get to now each other and makes new friends, that is the way how people get better in life by working in groups. Working in groups make people to put more effort and attention in what they are doing because we want to get better opportunities in life, good greats and chances of getting a great job."

886,4462E068017D,"This prompt is asking if they should reduce summer vacations because they think its hard for students to retain informartion easily after a long break.

Summer you can travel with your family to different places and have fun and not to worry about school things. Students should have summer break after months of been at school and they can take their stress out during the big break and focus on other things outside of school. You can travel to different places or countrys to see your love ones if you haven't seem them in a long time. Summer is like enjoy myself time because you can do things you can't do while you are in a school year because its a short time but summer is like two months break. Students can go to retake classes during the summer if they fail and they want to recover a credit for a class. Students that play sports would have more fun enjoying playing it because they don't have to worry about anything but stay in shape for their sports and they have more time to play sports. For the students that like to read a lot they have a lot of time to their self and can spend major of their time at the library reading tons of books. Students that like to travel a lot they can anywhere and later they can write journal or take pictures and tell their classmates how their summer went.

Bad things if they reduce summer break will be more school time. People wouldn't be able to go places because they have to attent to school and they would have to worry a lot. Most people would be stress from school if they don't have a long break like summer. Summer wouldn't be fun for students because thats when they all gather together and they have fun and enjoy theirselfs.

I think the school boards should not reduce summer break because you can travel with your family to different places and have fun and not to worry about school things. Students should have summer break after months of been at school and they can take their stress out during the big break and focus on other things outside of school. You can travel to different places or countrys to see your love ones if you haven't seem them in a long time.

But same people are using technology to do quick look at their email, look if some one is texting them form far distance like friends and family, checking if they got the job they sign up for, and the news what happened in the world. What people should do is to use technology for enmercy only because you can save some one life when they get in to a accedient. People should stop using technology for sign up for job's they should do it on person so they can see how good are you in the job, if are you on time, and if you are do it the right work. Some peolpe love technology because it makes thing easier for them things to do. Most of the people are into technology.

1436,6E248B1F33B0,"The one person that has shared wisdom and experience with me is my friend, Generic_Name. Learning or sharing wisdom and experience with her have taught me a lot of thing that is around the environment. The benefit of learning experience from people is because it help to make the right choice, help to know activities more easily, and also it help people to be strong.

Making the right choice is not something that everyone are able to do on their own. The experience and wisdom learned form people can help to know the mistake that have been done which will help them to prevent it form happening. It helps with learning from other failed experience in life which also help to bring the best out in making that right choice in life today.

People doing thing and knowing activities more quickly other it because they have more wisdom and experience for a long time or they have notice the activities form someone they know in their life time. Having the experience of knowing thing easily can happen in both in school or at the work place. It helps them to move forward with others that are high than moving backward.

It also help people to be strong in so many ways by giving them some encouragement that they can be better than what they were before. It also gives hope to a lot of people in today's life. Experience and wisdom can easily help people that are not too great in doing thing outside their home and also make them to the top of their school or their work.

In conclusion, learning wisdom and experience can be very helpful in people life today. Experience can help give them power that they can be better than what they were and also learning for people's mistakes so that they can prevent it from happening .                         "
743,394F5867B7EC,"Working alone is great but have you ever thought about the benefits of working in groups? for example, when you are working with a group of people it it easier to get ideas; for example,you can all put your thoughts tougher and find out the resolution. Also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks; some people take longer than others so its good to have people around to help.

Most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example,if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions; which will help throughout the way. In other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out;instead of figuring it out by themselves.

Working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example,some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework; while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. It will also benefit the teacher because there won't be any late papers.

There are benefits of working in a group but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example,sometimes it gets loud in the group and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. Even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting , it is still a more beneficial way for students.

In conclusion, working alone is a better way for students to show what they know but working in groups is more helpful for students who are struggling. It has been listed on google that Researchers have proven that it is a more helpful way to learn."
3178,DF74545A44C8,"The great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

This is mena that people setitng their direction to high they falling quick, but they setting their direction too low that achieve their mark.

For my opinion, people set their aim as high as they can, because they know that if they set too low; they won't have that power to finish or to get it. This made people thought their aim is high; they need to work harder not just the 100 precent they need to put more than 100 precent into it and get thieir aim. Not all the people can reach as high as they set, but at least they try eventhought they fall they still on a good postion. For example, I have a quze total points is 100 and I try to get the full points, but in the end I only get 85, it's still good, because I know my aim is high, I need to do hard. When people set their aim too low, they won't have that power to finish it, because you know that it's easy to get it, and you don't even have to prepare or try for it. This make you don't know what you really want and need. It will let you just stuck there. From my opinion, I really agree Michelagelo's satement ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

In my conclusion, people should set their aim as high as they can, eventhought they cannot reach it, but at least they try it, but don't set a easy aim that you don't even have to try your best to get it, this will not improve yourself. "
1491,73234AB62383,"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.

Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them .

Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they don't go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.

Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.

In my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .

I wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep."

271,13AB4CC7F80F,"I like to play my instrument,because I like the relaxing songs we play. And my older brother use to play the violin so that's two reason why i started to like instruments so much. And I been trying to learn how to play the violin for a while now. I also learn how to play old to joy which is a amazing song in my opinoin. My new music teacher this new year has very been pushing us to our limit which is great because he could help us on the parts we don't know how to play yet. Moon night is a old music sheet that we still play. The music notes on it are really hard to play, LIke on line number four and ten. It seems like i'm been getting better in just a short amount of time which my teacher and brother are very proud about. If i do master the violin i'm gonna try the paino next and my reason for that is just to play it on a rainy down and I know which song to play and it's called thank you by dido, it's such a lovely song to play when it's raining outside. Also i heard a song called happier which I been trying to play this week. I wonder what kind of jobs i can get if I keep going down this path, hopefully it's a good paying job. Instruments are good educational activitys becasue it makes people to try over and over again until they get it right which is very hopefull ti those who want to keep trying. My brother haves been takeing his time teaching me how to play the violin because he nocites that i been playing it lot or he had nothing else to do. The good thing about instruments it teaches you that things take time and partices to learn just like most things in the world which is really hopefull.

And ever instrument teaches you something a little different from one another which I find it amazing that each instrument has new to explore on it. Also in the world of music you can your music you just need to take your time with it. When you do that song can become the next big thing. Plus you can your feelings into the song and playing from the heart is what music is all about. Playing from the heart can be a little odd to most people, and most people are shy about it as well. And stundents can help each other parts of the music sheet so the teach won't have to waste his time ever stundent who dosen't know a part. Learning how to play a instrument it enjoyable and a new to learn something new, Which every teacher wants from their stundents correct? Also buying music sheets is also a way to go out to world and see whats going on. Which music your mind is your only limit, well that's what my music teacher saids anyway. Plus you might go into a collage for free if your very good at playing your instrument. Which is really amazing that could happen. And i think theres clubs for playing imstruments so stundents can learn which each other with things that they don't know yet which could be a huge help for them and maybe later on as well. Also if they have someone in thier famliy knows how to play a instrument they can teach them as well, and maybe even more."
3447,EC3B982A622A,"I do not agree with adding another hour to school, because some of us would like to go home, some people have places to go after school. For example what if a student wants to go pick up his grandma from the airport but her flight gets in while the student is still in school. If school would've ended at the normal time he could've went to pick up his grandma. Even though staying an hour more would help students more, there won't be anytime left for after school activities. in the winter time it gets dark fast and some kids like to go outside and play for a while after school,but if they add that extra half an hour kids would have to get home fast and leave there stuff to go outside for a little bit. There are many bad reason why adding another hour to school is a bad idea but, there are many good ones too like a good reason would be kids can catch up on there missing work, a bad idea is kids go home later then they used to and some parents would not like that. If they do add an hour of school they should open the school at 8:30 instead of 7. If we come at 8 kids would get more sleep and not fall asleep in class with more sleep kids have more energy and with ms are more energy kids are more productive. In my opinion i don't think adding another hour is not so bad, just that no other student would wanna stay another hour. Students could get frustrated because all the work they do at school,and then kids got to go home and study and do there homework. Therefore i disagree with the idea of adding another half an hour."
2506,BA5DC45B0E3F,"Our character develop sometimes by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of a person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you can't really pick a side and stay at it , there's good in every bad and there's bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs. They're wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that don't care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isn't just about being a good or a bad person , it's about having a good personality , loving yourself and loving people , making others happy , having a positive energy , but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed , like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, that's if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really can't choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control , it all depends on the life you were born in , like your culture , religion , and the people around you , but that's not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and life's decisions will choose something else for you , life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are , they always change , grow up , be mature , or things that happens with them in life will make them grow up even if they're young or still not an adult yet. For me I think age isn't the thing but a number , the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think , if life didn't force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different don't try to copy someone else and be life them , just be you , be different it's more beautiful."
1835,8A6FEEA6C0D3,"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world.

Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the one's that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them.

People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set.

I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams.

All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished."
3309,E54E238C6DDB,"I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. In conclusion i think it's a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student's to take online classes so they can get the help they need.

3099,DBC60BDBC49E,The school board shouldn't add one and half hours to school each day. To begin one reason i think they shouldn't is that a lot of kids who play sports or clubs after school might not be able to because they don't have time to learn about how life is and how difficult it is and people's life difficulties. One example is that some kids play videos and since they dont have lots of time out side of school they might just play video game instead of sports and if you give them more time out of school more opportunities students will have. secondly Students will be more tired and less focus because if students have more time in school the more earlier they will have to sleep and most students don't fall asleep early also students have homework since they well most likely be tired from school they might take a nap and there might either wake up to late to do homework or not have time to finish all there homework. Thirdly more students will not want to be in school and may drop out from either too much stress or they just don't want to be in school because the longer time there in school the more tired they are and less time they have to do what makes them feel relaxed or not have time to do what they love to do. students also might not have time to make friends because there focusing on school and it might ruin there social skill and conversation with strangers out side of school. Lastly less amount of time they have to spend with there families because they would have to go to school for extra time and as soon as they get home they have to do homework and honestly by the time there done there going to be most likely tired to do anything beside resting or sleeping. Also some students have younger siblings to take care of after school so that would put more stress on a student and either a family would have to pay for a baby sitter or some families don't have money to pay for one so parents might take there student out of school just to take care of there sibling and so the extra time in school wouldn't help him. To conclude those are the main reasons why I think we shouldn't have more school hours in school.  
700,35D43561EE62,"Studies have shown one way to improve a student achievement is to start a after school homework club. Some ways this club can help students can be help with home work,help with classes,and having a talk with teachers. would you volunteer by helping a student?

How can this club help students? It can help kids with home work,not every one likes home work,home work is like getting sand or dirt in your delicious ice cream. some students are not good at doing there home work so this club can be good for helping them with homework. You can get help with subjects like math,science,and reading. Do you need help with any subject from school?

Reasons why I would volunteer for this club. I don't mind helping students out with work but if its bad kids then I am not helping them,I do not want to be treated like trash. It wont affect my agenda because most of the time I am just staying home playing video games so I don't mind helping out,I will finally have something better to do. Helping someone is like a firefighter getting a cat out of a tree,I am the firefighter and the cat is the student and the tree is the students problem. The feel of knowing someone looks up to you because you helped them get better in math is a outstanding feeling. I like helping people out because it is some thing nice to do and I think every one should help students get better at school subjects so we all can do something nice as a team.

Studies have shown one way to improve a student achievement is to start a after school homework club. how can this club help students get better at school work? It can help them with home work like science,math ,and reading. Reasons why I would volunteer for the club and what I would teach.1 reason is because helping a student makes me feel amazing and it helps me be a better leader,being a leader can help me with running a company or other jobs. The subject I would teach would be science because I know a lot in science,I have a wonderful grade in science,and science is fun because you can do experiments. this is why a after school homework club is good for students who need help.

Is it really true that Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Thesis

I honestly disagree with this knowledge is important.

Claims

Knowledge is more important than Imagination.

Can Imagination be helpful to you.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets see what we learned.

Conclusion

That was all my reasons why I disagree what Albert Einstein said. Knowledge is more important than Imagination, what can Imagination do to help you, Some people can start to Imagine and think that it will help them. those where my reasons why i disagree."
3028,D8F9861CD318,"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the work early ?

The programs that some school districts offer to the students that allow students to graduate one year early, is not covenient for the students. To do only three years of high school is not good way to start forming yourself. They will not have the necessary knowlege as a regular high school student. It is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school.

First, to do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself for the future, all this is based on the future and what you are going be able to do, for example, if you do not do the four years in high school you will miss more information, that is going to affect you in the future, and sometimes you will not be able to select courses, or in some cases you will have to take these courses on summer, which is not a good idea, because most of the students with ages around sixteen and eighteen hang out a lot, so for the students is harder to focus on their thing as their courses, While the students that are doing four years of high school will have more time to focus on their courser, and they will have the oportunity to learn more.

Second, the student that decided to graduated early are not goint to have the necessary knowlege, as the students that are doing the four years, for example, responsibility is one of the most important things, that you will use in the future, so how can you get it, for example, the homework, projects, and team work that you will have in high school, because doing four years in high school give you responsibility, and new abilities in the proces of learnig, also it develop your brain, and as consequences of learnig, and responsibility you will get new skills that you will be able to use in your work area, or college, while the students that graduated early are not going to be able not have the enough experience to enter a new system.

Last, in my opinion the school that let student graduated one year early are not thinking in the welfare of the students, because they are not just letting the students go ealry, the schools had found a way that the student can rush themself to get out of the school soon, to go to college or work instead of doing the four years in high school, that will help a lot in the future.

Because it is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school, the students will not have the necessary knowlege as a regular high school student; to do only three years of high school is not good way to start forming yourself for the future.           "
314,16DEF72E220A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I don't think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument.

Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they don't know. And if someone who dont' teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they don't help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didn't go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesn't have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didn't study as well as can't catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you can't study by yourself, It couldn't help you that learn.

Also, the students can't communicate with other students. It means that the student can't study with other students that they can't make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that they'll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students.

On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesn't have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we don't have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we don't have to demand to do only one way,

they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home.

In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.         "
1836,8A7081C962D7,"To conserve energy and resources, some bussines have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consist of ten hours. In my opinion, this idia would bring benefits for some students and disavantages too. For example the students who really like the school it would be a great idia, to be doig team-progets or just spend time with friends and teachers. In the other hand some students don't really like to be 8 hours in the school so I just realize that they would not agree with that idea.

A mayor porcent of the students wo don't like school, decide to quit or just apply to an elective shool. Like in my case olmost 1 year ago i decide to start going to an elective school, the reason is that I work a full tme job after school and it was difficult to arrive on time everyday to the basic school. I thing the idea of adding 2 hours more to the schedule of the basic school is not a good idia, because students who are in the high school and have a job as a part-time or even a full time would decide to apply to a basic school. I mean a basic school is better for the students who work at the same time they canmake their schedule smaller and have enough time to sleep, work, and to study. In conclusion, this is my point of view."
3860,FE3CA06DDCA1,"Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one's talking most of the time? Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. Reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. Reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice.

They will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said  I dont think these would help me much I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more.

If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. If you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. Everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. If you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice.

In conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. When you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. Also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice. "
1867,8C83ACEF2A15,"I agree that some district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of 4, some students don't have enough money or they don't want to go to college. Their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life.

Nowadays employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant,store et in one year. Other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old,they would have more time, energy, and interest. Some teenagers just don't want to be at school for years they don't like school, this program help them have more time to experience, try new things, prepare them for what they want to do and how they want to do it.

Generic_Name

INTRODUCTION:

Havent you ever thought of starting an after school homework club for students who are having difficulty in certain subjects?.

BIGININ:Well in certain states school barely have extra help for students for Example in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and more states but in the united states is different they have extra programs the main thing is us the students they want a good education in my Generic_School we have an after school it's call Hornet 21 and in my opinion i think that having a program like that is awesome why you might be asking well here are some few reasons 1st of all you get to see on what the students need help 2nd of all you get to ask them on what they get stuck or don't understand. 3rd of all you get to meet you'r teacher and they get to meet you. there some students that are to shy to talk about it this will also help the teachers on where or what group they should them to work on what do they need work on? witch would be very helpful them and there teachers and the teachers might notices some changes or not. not every mistake can be change but you can start fresh again.

FIRST: it would also be helpful to see on what subject there really good and they are confident about it those teachers who help on everything like they know everything they move from one to another class room they could help those kind of students that get homework from different subjects for example like Math,Scients, Social studies. and the teachers could inform the students teacher on what there struggling and on what there all good on I mean you never know if those student's could be are next president or are next doctor, police.

this program is also nice because it helps students practice English not for all of them but for some of them yes this help me a lot.

MIDDLE: this program will also make the student proud of them self a little thing can change our world to be come better our country need programs like this programs that are going to success us programs that were going to be proud of this kind of programs have help a lot of students i know sens elementary school and not should middle school have it high school and elementary to and is also nice because some parents come late to work and the program would be finishing about 4:50 so there going to be fine when they get home so they can be home alone this after school activity would also get them prepare for there exams they could study and they would easy get an A or a B. END You could also do this to a student who doesn't want to do there work or nothing you can make them stay in after school and they can finish what they decided to not do and that might be a big lesson for them to learn you could also tell some of the students to spread the word to some of there friends so you could get more students everyday and if they stay Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday on Thursday and Friday they could have a free day you could have them do soccer basketball anything they want if they deserved it, you could also announced one day so the whole school would know about the program this could also be fun for the teachers not just for the students teachers to well that's what i think on a after school homework club. Base on this information I can say that schools do need this program Because it's really helpful for the student's. outside in the worlds there some kids who don't even know what school is because there working to feed there family. The community should do more programs like this so students get extra help. not all the county gets to have fun activities like us. and my opinion is yes it's good to have after school programs for schools and kids who care and that have a featured."
942,48292985CC59,"Well I want to start saying that the first impressions about people can change but if the impressions change is because something happen. I'm saying it because of some of my experiences with other people that I met and change my impressions about them. Sometimes people don't change,instead of saying that people change your impressions about them maybe you need to know your self first and see what is happening also you need to known why that person change your impressions because maybe something sad or bad is happening on their life and you don't know it.

So let me tell you an experience that happen to me a few moths ago so I met this girl and she was very nice with me and I start thinking that she was that nice with everyone and no I was wrong she only was that nice with me so I decide to date her so I tell her if she want go to see a movie next weekend and she tell me, yes! and I say great so like 3 days before going to see the movie she start acting weird and I ask her if she was OK? and she tell me yes,so the next day I start talking with her and she tell me what was happening and she tell me that her mother was sick and she was sad,so she tell me everything that was happening and I understand why she was acting weird.

In conclusion my impressions about her it was starting to change but I decide to talk with her to see what was happening, before that I start saying that she change and my impressions about her change. is bad to change the impressions about a person without knowing what is happening in their life,because you don't know if that person is waiting for you to ask them what is happening. So I think you should ask that person what is happening and then you decide what are you going to do. These are some of the many reason why I disagree with the statement."
1457,7065B172D758,"When you have a problem do you think to yourself, how can I do my best to fix this problem? American jazz legend Duke Ellington said,""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" In my opinion, I agree with Duke Ellington's quote. One reason, is if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.

I agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.

I also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.

Another reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice. Finally, it is important to do your best in a situation because it would make you improve yourself from your mistakes.

In conclusion, I agree with this quote because you should always try to do your best in a problem. First, you wouldn't regret at least trying to solve a problem. Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it. Finally, if there is a problem it's also chance for you to show others what you can do.      "
831,400E5AA27067,"It has been said that first impressions are impossible to change, I disagree with this stiemant. The reason

I disagree with this is because first of all first impressions are a snap chat of who you are.

Second of all the more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind of who they thought you were from the first time they meet you. At this time of peride people are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, so they are willing to give a second chance.

First impressions are a snap chat of who you are, for me personally first impressions are always heard because based on the few second I spend talking to a person they will always think of me as that person specie if am never going to see them aging. Job interview is a big one because based on how you present your self at that moment of time will determan whether you get the job or not, and you might get nerves and act a sertine way that will not help you get the job even tho that's not who you really are. For example like a year ago I had soccer tryouts for a big soccer team the whole month I have been training and feeling good, but when the day came I was nerves because I never had the chance to tryout for a big team like that. I ended up not getting into the soccer team because the whole time I was worried what time the coaches will think of me and they were not impress with me the first, but this year I made it into the team the coaches liked me because I was much comfortable on the ball this time then last time and the coaches changed there mind about me . What am trying to say is first impressions are not impossible to change.

The more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind, Sometimes you will like person based on for the few seconds you seen them or talk to them, but then when you spend more time with me you come to find out that they are not as much as inserting as they seam. For example I had this kid in my class he was funny and seem inserting. but the more I got to now him i found out that he is funny when they are a group of people around him but when you talk to him one on one he is like a whole different person. This just goes to show that it is not just bad first impressions that are not impossible it's the good one's too.

People are starting to get the idea that first impressions are't always correct, Job are starting to understand that first impressions are not always correct for that reason they are willing to have two job interviews with. Sometimes it might be first on the phone than in person or just have two job interviews in person and I think that is a good idea spicily for people like me who are not good at first impressions.

inconclution,

Some people might say first impressions are impossible to change and I can see where they are coming from, but all am trying to say is the more time you spend with a person you are going to have more understanding of who they are. The only time I would say first impressions are almost impossible to change is if you are going to see the person just for one time and never see them aging. If that is the case than what ever the image of you they have that will just be it but be sides that first impressions are not impossible to change."
2481,B86530090737,"There are lots of activities one can to do outdoors. Many people now a days stay in there home and play video games. There is so much to do outdoors like you can go rock climbing. Rock climbing is a very fun, dangerous, and healthy outdoor activity to do. Many people who do rock climbing are living the happiest and healthiest life they can. You can also do hunting. Hunting is also a fun outdoor activity you can do, but it requires risk to do. Hunting is done by a gun which many people cant use or dont have but hunting is a fun activity to do if you do have a gun and know how to use it.

you can also go to parks. Parks are really enjoyable, there is lots of fun stuff to do in a park. There are slides, swings and other fun stuff. There are also animals some times in a park. its like a park and zoo mixed together. people can really enjoy there self in parks. Parks are not only for little kids and there are not always slides,swings, monkey bars etc. in a park. There are some parks that are only made for people who like to jog, run and walk. There are so many different kind of parks.

One of the most enjoyable thing you can do is play a sport, like Soccer, Football, Baseball, Tennis etc. There are many places outdoor you can go to play. There are soccer fields made for people who like to play soccer. There are Football fields etc. Sports are not only fun but they also are healthy for you. Like in Soccer there is nothing you can do accept running after the ball. Football is also fun and healthy for you and many other sports. Doing something outdoors is way more fun than doing something inside. If you play video games all the time you can lose your eyes and you can get fat easily.

You can also go to the beach. Beach is the most funnest and enjoyable place. There is sand. ocean, sun, waves and other fun stuff. if you cant swim you can also stay in the sand and make a sand castle or something like that. If you do know how to swim you can go to the ocean and swim in the waves and have lots have fun. If you dont want to swim and make sand castle you can just lay on your towel ad enjoy the hot sun. If you are with your friends and family you can also play lots of different games like frisky, Tag, etc. You can play music on a boombox or a speaker and have fun with that.

Another fun activity to do outside is skydiving. If you want to fly skydiving is just the thing for you. It is another one of the most fun outdoor activities but it requires skill and lots of confidence to do a skydive. If you dont know how to open or use a parachute you will not be skydiving alone you will be tied to professional skydiver and you will skydive with him/her. You still need the confidence to skydive or you can have a heart attack or you can pass out and passing out in the midair is not very good for you, you can break your neck with the air pressure or die.

Skydiving is not really healthy but it still is fun and enjoyable.

Hiking is also one of the outdoor activity and it is really fun. In hiking you can go to mountain peeks or just walk to the middle of a mountain. Hiking is similar to rock climbing but you dont have to climb rocks you just have to walk on the track and and have fun. hiking is also one one of healthy outdoor activities. Once you reach your goal you can enjoy the view and be proud of yourself. Hiking is not an easy thing to do there are many rocks and unstable ground on the way but if you do hiking often it will be easy for you.

Camping is also one of the outdoor activities. camping is fun and enjoyable but it is also dangerous and risky. Camping is when you alone or with your friends go to a forest or camping spot and live there in a tent for one or four days. camping is so much fun especially if you are with your friends or family. you can cook yourself food, enjoy the nature etc. If you like nature camping is just the thing for you. camping can be dangerous and risky because there are a lot of dangerous animals in the woods like lion, bear etc. but if you pick the right camping spot for yourself then there is no danger. many camping spots are where there are less harmful animals.

Outdoor activities are fun to do. Most people dont them because they waste all of there time time on video games and indoor stuff. Most people dont like nature and the are discussed of it. outdoor activities are fun and healthy for you they can keep you in shape and you can have the time of your life. Outdoor activity is for people who really like nature and want to stay healthy.           "
27,025722D0AFB7,"Now a days most employers are looking for specific characteristics in potential employees'. They look for someone who is responsible, hard-working, humble, and kind. Someone who is going to be a role modle for the company, and also for the community. Commonly, they look for a person who has experience, specially with costumer service. When the company decides to hire someone with all of these characteristics, the company is going to increase its sales, more costumers are going to visit the location, and they are going to be happy with the service provided.

I belive that by having a good behavior and showing our values and manners, we are representing our families, and who we really are. Manners and values play a big role when hiring an employee. When communicating with costumers there has to be mutual respect. Responsability is also really important. Showing up to work on time, with a clean uniform and a possitive attitude, is a way to show responsability and respect to the company. Therefore, by working hard and staying true to your self we are going to help make work a better place.

A role model is kind, humble, learns from its mistakes every day, as well as to be a better person at work and outside from work. An employee is a role model for the community, and also it represents the company.

As we all know, work can be hard sometimes, so it is important to ask for help when needed. By doing this we are creating a comfortable atmosphere for costumers to feel like home and to feel welcome. Eventually, sales are going to increase and the company is going to make more money.

Most teenagers my age don't have that much experience in any jobs. Mostly because they're too young, and the jobs they apply for recures at leas 1 or 2 years of experience. However, I think that at least we should get an opportunity to get the job, because no one would ever know how good we can be if we don't get an opportunity. In my past experience, I've worked before with as a cashier. I'm also respectful and responsible. I take my job really serous and I don't like to play games. I'm a straight forward person, who belives that if employees are good to the costumers, more and more people will visit the location and the bussines will show more growth.

I highly belive that I am a good candidate for this position. For me it is really important to have manners and values, specially inside work. To treat people with kindness and respectfuly. Also to be responsible, and something that is really important for me is to work hard to get what i want. When i go to a restaurant or to a store, I like to feel welcomed, so that why I treat costumers the way how i like to be treated. In advance, i will like to say the importance of being a role model for our generation, We are the future of this world and we have to make good decitions every day.            "
752,39E0A362CF29,"The Generation of today they all want success instead of failure,for success to occur we have to fight for it,success does not come by itself every single human have to built,A success live without losing the enthusiasm,but the problem of today, is that people usually likes to give up things. Although, some say that success does not consist of going from failure to failure actually, it does consist of going from failure to failure,one reason is,because we are getting stronger. At some point we fail in something,for my own perspective it is like a new opportunity for us,so we can learn from our mistake. In general all the people at some point can commit an error,but the problem here is not the mistake committed, the problem is that people start losing the willing to learn,and willing to be better. there is not even one perfect human, who does not fail in anything. Another reason is because you can meet your level. It is really important for us to know our capacity. I am sure that our brain is not limited we put limit in our lives we all have the ability to get things done, it doesn't matter the situation or the problem. There always have been solutions for every single situation,for all the people who does not give up.

Those who believe, that success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm have their reasons. They believe that failure does not give a good outcome to be re joy of;They seem failure like a pain hurting people making them feel really bad, and it makes them not to keep trying. They also think that failure make them doubt themselves,and that is not true my argument is not to give up so easily. They have to try until they get it done,and clearly,but nevertheless they regret it.

In my point of view, I believe that when failure occur we get stronger. An example of this would be my friend Generic_Name: 20 years old, a white man,black eyes, and black hair. He wanted to go to college, to study electricity, but his finance was slow,so decided to learn it without going to college. I knew right away that he will be challenged to make his way thought,so he start practicing looking tutorials, how to fix things, how to change a lamp, all that kind of stuff,but my surprise was when the time pass he apply for a electricity company. I said to him

! are you serious ! don't tell me that you already know electricity. He got a moment of silence... and respond yes, i make my own way he start explaining me all the difficulties part that he was on. He said that at some point he wanted to just forget that,but something inside of him wanted to keep trying. Of course the people were saying no you cant do it in a funny way,but he did not listened to the people. Moreover he wanted to keep going. He knew that it was something hard to become an electrician,but not impossible. Today Generic_Name is a really good electrician. He did not only learned electricity. He also learned how to paint houses. This is a proof that we cannot give things up only because it seem hard. It is not based on your finance. Some people have a low economy,but still there is not wall that can stop the willing to do something. It only required a personal character and volunteer. What might happened if Generic_Name loss the enthusiasm he probably will be putting less importance on him.

I also think that when failure occur frequently, we will know and meet our level our own capacity, like what are we made of. A prove of this can be my sister in law. She was on high school senior year. She had some problem in her algebra 2 class at the beginning she did not understood anything. She was in every single class,but the problem was that her grades in algebra were critical,so she talked with her boyfriend Generic_Name which is my brother. She was saying that she did not wanted to go to her algebra 2 class. Not anymore,because it was too hard she feel less intelligent and she wanted not to keep trying. My brother respond, I think that you are just starting in the way that you have not try like I would like you to try, if you doubt yourself that is a problem,because I can see a really smart person right in front of me. Believe in yourself and try again after that, she decided to give everything or nothing, so she was studying really hard, asking a lot of questions to the teacher, with that hunger to learn, and be the best in her Algebra class. Even though her classmates were ironic. Her eyes were not on them. In addition she learned a lot at the beginning she was below of her classmates, more often she was the Hornet in her class with a reward for trying super hard, and get things done on time. Image what might occurred if my sister in law give up, so easily of course she will fail the class in all quarters and have that tone of loser on her.

In conclusion, when failure comes don't let it the opportunity to take over you,because you will be thinking of yourself bad things. If you are having hard times and you can't see things clear, just ask these question to yourself Do i am doing enough for it or i am just starting?. every single of us have a big ability there no exceptions. there is people who really know what they want,and fight for it and there is people who easily give things up. We should be those kind of people who does not look for their goals and dream who are sitting down expecting how other people naturally reach to their dreams."
1789,876B9CDDC1FC,"I donr undertan why people is stupid to ''act' as someone else. From my point of view, is so stupid. Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latino's accent trying to be cool or staff, and it's not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Because with that they're showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, that's no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention. What I want to get with that is,that they is another people who do not have atention or love and start doing things to their friend or other people start to pay them atention. Personally, I feel comfortable with the little what I have. It's not my idea be someone that I don't. And I also start to be neutral. How is it? For me, it's like if someone want to be friend, good; if people do not want to meet me, it's ok, too. Lastly, I don't care about other people, I only care about me, my 4 friends and my family, and that's it. I feel I don't need to meet more people. I'm good with what I have, because while less people I met, less people treason me. "

Imagination is more important than knowledge because you don't actually have to know something, you can use your imagination instead.

You can use your imagination to solve math problems. You can use your imagination to build stuff. You can use your imagination to draw or design.

You can use your imagination to solve math problems. When you don't know or don't understand something, sometimes you can use your imagination. You don't actually have to know anything to solve the math problem, but sometimes is best to use your imagination because you don't know what the problem is going to be about. For example, if you don't know how to do math or you never got to go to school, you can use your imagination to solve the math problem.

You can use your imagination to build stuff. If you like to build or to make stuff, you can always use your imagination. It's best to use your imagination when your building things because if you use your imagination, you can create things that nobody did before. Some of the useful things that you're building can help a lot of people. For example, you can build toys, make video games, or do anything you want to build with your imagination.

You can use your imagination to draw or design. You can do a lot of great thing with your imagination and not just have to know everything. You can do different things or different designs with your imagination. Some people use their imagination to draw things or make things. For example, you can draw pictures, make cloths, or design things that you like using your imagination.

You can do many different thing like designing, building, or even making things just by using your imagination and not just your knowledge. Like Scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge.""

That means that you don't actually have to know everything, some people can use their imagination to change the world and make a lot of things. You can do anything using your imagination!"
2522,BB5B58E098AB,"Well i think we choose our own character traits,because its up to you what you want to do, we choose if we want to be happy,sad,or angry. I've learned that with my mom,she always tells me,""you choose to be happy,sad,angry""

Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and that's okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,it'll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened..

After that your character it'll be what you choose to make it.

For example,i've been trought a lot this past years ,my chilhood was not the best i did not had a father or my mom when i was a little girl,i grew up with my grandparents my uncle raped me when i was seven years old,my other unclu he used to hit me all the time in my head,my grandma used to hit me with the belt , i was fat when i was a little girl,and people used to make fun of me,

That really affect me ,because i'm unsecure about my body,or how i look,i've in Hospitals because i try to kill myself last year,because i was depressed,because all the things that i've been trought and now i choose to be happy,im going to therapits on Monday's,i started working ,i play soccer,or i go out with my sister.

I have choose to be happy .

Sometimes it's hard to be happy,even that you know you want to be happy you just don't see one reason to be,and it's sad because you know your family it's feeling the same pain you feel inside of you ,the only thing you think in those moments are, ""why would i do this"" or ""why am i trying so hard "" .

Those are the worst feelings,when you want to get up in the morning but you can't.

In conclusion,my opinion it's that everyone needs to know that ,our character will be what we choose to make ,we have to make good decisions to be good."
619,2EEB160A4BD1,"85% of people think that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has been said that people who have a great attitude have more opportunity to sucess in life than people who have a negative attitude. However, some people may think that a good attitude is not always necessary because there are job that doesn't required a positive attitude. Having a good attitude can help you to find a job, make new friends and help you to archieve your goals.

For example, it can help you to find a job and if your job required to comunicate with others people your attitude will make people to like you, also your manager will like how you work and how you treat the costumers. Furthermore, your attitude can make you the best employer in your job and help you to find a better job.

In addition, a good attitude can make you find new friends and they will always want to talk to you or be all the time with you even if they don't feel good they know you can make them happy because you have a positive attitude that they like. More over, you could only have friends that have a great attitude like yours because people that have a negative attitude would not like to have you as a friend because you are always happy.

To archieve your goals you may need to have a good attitude because when you don't feel good and you don't want to continue trying your attitude will help you to never give up and continue trying until you archieve your goals. When I don't want to continue in high school and I just want to get a job I like to have a good attitude and think about my goals and how far I'm right now and that help me to make me happy and to not give up.

In other words, your attitude is really important in your life not everyone has a good attitude and not everyone think that attitude is important, but a great attitude can help you with many things like to make good decisions, to be a better person, and to make people love you.                "
2410,B3241FAB44C9,"A homework club is a great opportunity for students who have a difficult time understanding their work. Sometimes work can be hard and not everyone can understand it. Homework clubs can help students understand their work better and have more confidence with it.

The homework club would have to start at the end of the day when everyone has their homework,the club can be from 3:00pm to 5:00pm that way students have 2 hours to get their work done and have time to chill out at home.

I am sure that many other people agree that we should have a homework club. We all know this would be a great opportunity for students that have a difficult time understanding their work.

Homework clubs can also help students improve grades which will then lead to higher test scores all because students will get extra help and have someone who will help them understand their work better. I am sure that starting a homework club will lead students in a great path to success and wealth."
2395,B204869FA146,"Is technology a positive or negative effect on human life? Technology is a negative effect on all human life because it is a limitation on communication. With technology there is no talking to others, so you become socially awkward. You would not be able to talk infront of a crowd and you do not go out to meet new people.

People become socially awkward by not having the practice to communicate with others. You can not spend the rest of your life shopping online hiding from people. People who do not socialize hide their face when speaking, they can not even order food without getting shy. It is sad how the world is relaying on technology to do everything for them. Something that is amazing is having someone to talk to in person. You would be able to see their emotions and feel their energy when you are talking to them. People are not their just to listen but to also give advice to you. I do not think technology does the same. It does not ask how was your day or how are you feeling because it is not human it is a robot.

When you do not talk to enough people in your life you start to become shy. You will start to realize that in almost every job you need to talk in front of a crowd of people. Even if you can not do that you will have to because that is part of your job just to communicate. That is why in school they start to teach you at a very young age how to communicate. Teachers asign presentations for the students to get comfortable talking to others. Practice is the best way to handle talking to others because talking through the phone and in real life are two different things. When talking on the phone you do not need to see the person you are talking to or you can even just hang up. But in real life you have to learn how to start a conversation with someone and keep the conversation going.

People do not go out to find new friends. Yes, it is awkward going up to someone and saying, do you want to be friends. But that is where it all starts by making one friend you have achived a lot because now you have a friend that you can talk to and not feel alone. You can not stay at home just being online. You should ask your friend do you want to go watch a movie or go eat. That is better then staying at home a playing games all by yourself. Yes, you can talk with your friends and play games at the same time but it is also important to change things up a little bit. Just once in a while find something else to do rather than sitting at home. You can do a sport. You communicate a lot when playing a sport. Being at home you are just surounded but technology and you would never really get away from it if you do not try. Another thing: making friends on socail media is not the same as in person. There might even be a chance you never meet the person you met online or might not even be the person you thought they would be in person.

In conclusion even though technology is a great way to communicate with others that are long distance. It is still important to communicate face to face. Even if it is just for a couple of minutes you should still have someone to talk to. So that later on in your life if you get a job that involves you talking to a crowd you would not be scared. Also going out once in a while is not bad. You should not just stay at home playing games with your friends asked them do you want to go for a walk then you could talk to them in person. It is always a good thing to stay away from technology just somethings. There are other things that you can do even alone. You can read a book, sketch and color, or even just have a nice relaxing walk just to think. Technology should not stop you from having a good life and communicating with others. Just remember technology to some people is everything but to you it should not be."
283,14EE006078C4,"Some student can learn to attend classes from home. And I think it's a great way to learn if you want some good grades. If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live.

Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website can't be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered.

Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures.

Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like you're teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me.

Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me. But I likely used online because it pretty helpful because let say I forgot a textbook and my homework is due the next day. Well I can go online and check my answer if i got it right. And I sometime I always used online to see if how to bake a cake or other information that I need."

969,49F54A35F6F3,"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that it's better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself.

Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses.

Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other person's side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person.

However, even if they won't be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely.

In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever it's taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals. "

2714,C7BD62EA392F,"Dear Principal:

I personally don't think its a good idea that your considering changing school policy so that people may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

Sports has nothing no do with school, that's just another activity that's after school and the better you play sports the better your going to be good at school, specially with your grades. It keeps you organized and makes you stay on topic. For people sports are really important and really fun to play, it makes you runs and concentrated on how you play. You might think that for some reason that's why people are getting a bad grade average, but its not like that. I consider that sports are really important to me, and even if i don't play in a team i still love to play any kind of sport. It keeps me awake and motivated. It keeps me from stop being lazy all the time. There are 2 main reasons why i don't think its a good idea that you should change that policy. My first main reason is sports have nothing to do with school ,is just another amazing activity that people would enjoy instead of just watching TV or being on the computer. My second reason is like my mom always told me a story. When she was little and lived back in Mexico, she would tell me all about her childhood and what she would do at my age. She used to tell me that she would run every morning to exercise and breath the fresh air outside, after that she would be with my grandfather and helping him with everything that she could and then she would play Basketball with her friends. Having a little challenge to see who would win and just to have fun. I remember asking her if sports had to do anything with school? if that was an activity to bring my grades up ?' What she said Exactly was "" They invented sports so that kids, teenagers and people would have a routine and be a better person. Believe it or not mostly for teenagers, sports brings there grade up and well organized , and when i started playing sports, it did bring my grade up. What the captains do is that they show you how to be on time and do all your assignments so its similar to sports.''

I'll never forget the message that my mom gave me about sports.

Their is no reason what will their reaction be to me back in the day , they didn't know what the older students and younger students react i bet they pray for the older students and younger students to get along on the first day of school, to see their reaction. What i think is it will be normal the effects like they will get use to it and they will mine they old busness plus to me they will say we gonna have to treat the younger students the same like everybody else .

Do they unfairly interfere in young people lives the curfew wants to Procter them people would think that they are interfere in their life. they want them to be save people won't like other people do what they said.

I think that curfew are trying to Procter them, and they don't want to interfere in their lives. But if the the curfew are adopting teenagers on the street after those hour they are breaking the law they are saying that the don't want other one to do adoptions after 10pm on weekday and on the midnight of the weekend. The curfew want to interfere in other people lives, because people won't like the curfew say something what they are respecting and they are not doing the right thing. Curfew they think that they are doing the right thing but they are not cause, if they would be doing the right thing they would already stop all that. It is unfairly that they are doing that because the dont have to care about other people.

other however the ones that need assistent might not know what to do when they have a decision to make. those people ask for help. they ask for guidance so that they can have more of an idea of what they are going to decide which gives them a more higher opportunity to decide which could led up to a good or bad situation. it all depend's on the person who is determen to decide.

Seeking for more advice will help you know other peoples opinions and how they feel and it will also depend on the question they are being asked. People might want others opinion because they want to know if people agree or disagrees with them and they might want to see if they feel the same way or different. When people want more advice it is because they want the best for them or they want the best others.

Some people might also need more advice because they are confused and they might not know what do in the life and might be worried. Advice from other people can be good or bad because some people will just give a lot of bad advice so life doesn't go good for you some people will give you good advice because they want the best for you. Asking other people for advice can help a human make a really good choice and for a human to go good in life and so that later in life they can have a good idea of what they need to work on.

People will be needing other peoples advice because they don't want to have a bad vision of life because if they do they won't know what life is actually about.

1449,6F30733E6B4B,"The first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree about that, cause me personal i don't have issues with no one around me. Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesn't mean that they don't like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesn't bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me.

This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didn't like me that much so we didn't talk too much. He didn't even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didn't like me because I was dating someone he liked that's what happen.

My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasn't I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked.

I don't get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I don't have issues with no one around me. It's just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that its's not difficult to have that. If you only have personality that good or have charisma that even greater to have, sighing out.                "

Generic_Name also wanted to become rich so he could help his family. But Generic_Name dreamed so little for himself. Generic_Name hated when his parent told him that he was not going to be a nurse. When he went to school the next day , he told his friend what his parent told him. Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right."", He said.`` Isn't nurse a good job too?,"" Generic_Name asked.``It is , It's just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents,"" He said.``Why,"" Asked Generic_Name .``Because it doesn't have enough money for you and your parents,"" He said. When Generic_Name went home ,he started thinking maybe his friend was right . He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first he didn't want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school,he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didn't have any problems .He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didn't have any money problems .

In addition

The one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because

I want to protect people in the country.

Once there was a girl named Generic_Name .Generic_Name lived with his father and mother but she didn't have any siblings. Generic_Name

Generic_Name 's father was a soldier .Generic_Name really loved being a soldier but her parent didn't let her be because in their country girls weren't allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name 's home and told Generic_Name's father that there was war in their town so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldn't go because he was really sick .And the problem was he only had one child and she was girl. Generic_Name's father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick and she didn't want her father to die and she also didn't want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self . When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her father's house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl she's a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didn't have any one to protect them .Generic_Name din't want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said he's waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didn't saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didn't have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her .

One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didn't have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general though that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers.

Dear

Manager I would like to employ for soldier because it is a good way to protect other people and it has a lot of money. Some people think that only men can work on soldier work but if you believe that you're wrong because soldier work is for all of us not only for men. If you're a woman and you want to be a soldier just do it it doesn't matter what type of a person you are."

When you has a great good positive attitude for your life is when you got everythin right .You can't worry for anything for the only thing the you can importam is to have a attitude right and the people dont talk bad about you, and the society. I think the positive life is the most importamt in every life. Every single life has to be positive an got a very good attitude. And every body cant have a greAt position to make the society most better.

I was thinking the attitude is very importamt for every body because if you don't have a great attitide you can get a job . Because in a job need people with a positive attitud. Also you can't improve and ,any job the you, cant have because you got a very greatt positive attitude about , you be very friendly every peron and every person who not have a very good attitude, the person never improve because,i think no body want a person the is not positive in his on life in every work need people with a very geat positive in his own life in has a great attitude   "
878,437B5914340E,"Why positive attitude is important in our life? People should have a positive attitude on their life. Specially on the work place, school, and home. But some people think that positive attitude is not that much important. It's important because they can make positive decisions, they people around them on work place will be good with them, and student with positive attitude can be respect full with their teachers and other students.

First of all, people with a positive attitude can make a positive decisions on their life. Because, if a person have positive thought and attitude they can good think and they can decided to have convention with good people. And every parents wants to teach their child to have good attitude with everyone, and they wants to their child respect them. And everyone like mother, father, brother, sister, friends will proud on them.

no matter where you are going, which communication you life, just be a positive with people and with yourself it will success you.

Moreover, the people around them on the work place will be good with them. Because everyone likes to be with a person that has a good and positive attitude. And to being good with each others. A person can have a good attitude and respect with people whom work with them. And you can save you job by being good and positive. If you work some where and you have bed attitude no body will loves you and they will never want to conversion with you. Being positive on work place.

finally, students with their positive attitude can be respect full with their teachers and other students. And also teachers will help and support them a lot. And students also learn in school to have positive attitude and teacher always telling to students if they have a negatives attitude, whats doing to happen with and if they have positives attitude, whats going to happen whit them. student by having negative attitude, they will lose everything on their life. just try to be positive by doing positive thing you will feel good.

It's good to have a positive attitude. And being success on your life. The attitude not going to change anything on your life, but the positive attitude can change one thing on your life thats a success you on your life. In life one thing is more important is to keep people around you. And how you going to keep them? by having positive attitude you can keep them. In my conclusion by having a positive attitude and being nice make your life easier.                                                             "
1255,60AEEA05E1A9,"Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday."

I believe and think,that all student's already graduate of the schools or university,they can work in a place where they can have some opportunity. Also they can putting in practic or demostrate your habilities.

In my opinion , every student, they can have a right, to demostrate your habilities,and then they can have more ideas,and get more experience for survive in his life. also they can be more smart, while they putting in practices your habilities,because they are gona putting the best effort. even think that they can be indepent by your self,also they gonna reconize all the effort of the parents didint for their Also too i think they can choice what carrier they would like to take or they can be think what is better for their or what is gonna helping in the future for getting a better life,that is my conclussion,about what are talking.

3515,EF9677DEFA79,"I think the teacher should let any students play in any sports or activities in school because the might be better at sports or activities than any other kids. They should at least have a c grade to play in the sports. They should at least have a c grade because they are not to low nor to high. I think just because a student doesn't have a b grade and higher doesn't mean that they cant play in a spot or activities. Maybe they are not that smart but they are trying there best but they might not be able to succeed. Sometimes kids cant improve because they might have problems at home the teachers might not notice.

Maybe even smart kids grades go low and the teachers might not notice.

Maybe they have problems at home.

I think before they not allowing them play activities or ports the teachers talk to them why they have low grades. Maybe the teachers could help them with a problem and help them improve their grades. If the teachers connect and get the confident with the kids they might now what is going on with there grades instead of the teachers saying ""you can not participate in an activity of sport.""

The teachers could talk with kids and see if they could do anything to help them with their grades and help them improve."
3294,E48441F53011,"Having a homework club after school isn't just a great way for students to get hel on homework but for many other reasons. These are my reasons on why I think having a homework club is beneficial.

Students don't just get help on their homework,but gives them a better understanding on the subject. Students also finish their homework and get a good grades on it.

Staying afterschool can encourage students to try harder on homework and school work as well. Staying for homework club can also make students to be more productive then going home and not getting homework done.

The homework club isn't just beneficial for students but as well as for teachers. Teachers can see questions that many students had a hard time on and then go over it. teachers find it useful to see questoions many students have a hard tim on so that they can practice. Teachers feel good about students finishing their homework and understanding the subject better.

In conclusion I think having a homework club is a great thing because students get a better understanding and getting their homework done. It encourages students to do better in school ,and it is very beneficial for teacher as well."
2268,A9ACA0A6ADE8,"The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said,""No act of kindness, no matter how small,is ever wasted.""

In the futerch there will be more acts of kindness that way we can be happy with one another

I hope that I am right about there being more acts of kindness ,but there are not a lot of people who do acts of kindness. I feel that people should do more acts of kindness. If you have time go to a nursing home and bring flowers to the elderly women. You can make a now friend by doing something kind ,or by just being nines to them. We all have to do something for a act of kindness also by doing something like that you feel better about your self before you help someone. Make your friend happy by doing something kind for them because you never know what they are going though. You also never know what someone else is going though ether.

I think what the Greek storyteller Aesop is trying to say is just be kind to people. Doing a act of kindness can make someone happy if they had a bad day. For Example,if you help them water there plants you can make them happy. A good way to do a act of kindness is by helping your mom Cooke diner another way you can help is by doing something you don't have to be asked to do. We all have those day were it is just a bad one and you dont want to do any thing well if someone does something for you with them not knowing you had a bad day at school or at work. there should be more people to do something kind to other people.

For Example, it a trash day were it came later then before me, and my step brother had to take the trash done to the side of the road. Will there was elderly layde that was outside when i was outside. in the place

I lived in there were always contortion going on. when we were my step brother had to get something and i stayed outside when the workers began to work aging. When they starred they scared the lady that was outside. I had to make a diction on if I should go in and get my mom or go to the lady that fell. I got my mom and went to her then my mom called 911

to come get her. When you do a good thing for someone they feel happy even if it is a small thing you do for them. That's why we need more people to do more acts of kindness."
518,278DE0BFACBF,"School's should not exend a school day by two hours and have a three day weekend. Just to conserve energy and and resources. Students would have to work a lot harder. Student would also have more resonsibility.

Student already hate school and are already really tired when they get home from an seven hour school day. So whyadd another two hours to there day. This would cause a kid alot more stress because of the extra amount of work they would have to do, keeping there grade up and staying fouces on there school work. Plus they would still have to come home and do there homework or any work they didnt finish in class.

Also some student might have a lot more of resonibility to do and adding another two hours would just stress them out with the amount of work. Like what if the kid was doing some after school activites, the kid would be to tired to do any clubs or sports. Students would also be unmotivated to get job because they would have the time or enegry to work.

Some would say that it would a good idea to extend the school days by two hours because of the extra day off they'll get, and because of all the energy and resourcs they'll be saving, but wearing out the kids by giving them extra work to do. Stressing them out moreis not worth it.

So in conclusion I dont think school's should extend there days and give us another day off. It would be to stressful and to tiring. Student need time to go home after school and rest, and have a few days to rest."
3381,E8E60E149B48,"New ideas always help us in life. Some people think people should make their on decisions, it's easy to see both sides, but one stands out people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters, because new ideas can help us decide something and guidance help us when we're confused to make that decision.

First, new ideas can help us decide something that we're not sure to decide. Guidance can explain what you want; they can tell us what is better for us or if something going to work. Guidance is really help full in life, if we didn't have guidance in our life would be a little hard for decide things. New ideas can help you decide something.

next, guidance help us when we're confused to make decision or don't know what to do. Guidance can help in our future and they help you decide witch idea is better for you and for your future. They always know what is better for us.

The other side, some people think that we should make our on decision, it make since, because it make us have responsibility and always know what we want, but what if you do the wrong decision and you can't change the decision, because you already choose it. That's why people can't make decision alone.

Concluding, people should choose guidance, not just choose your own idea or talk about it with someone because you can make the wrong decisions. New ideas can make people think more and make a good idea. Always think twice before make your own decision."
766,3B6893E9CA71,"If we're always doing somthing then we're always busy. As long as we keep busy we'll sooner be done then later. For example if there's a project to be due, then that project must be due, and if the teacher gives you a due date it would be more motivating to finish it on time then later or even late. As long as the person doesn't give up and keep focus, then there's nothing to worry about. Staying on task isn't that hard, but if there's any distractions you must remove yourself from that situation and get back on track. Like imagine if a student was in class having trouble focusing because the students around them we're distracting or noisy. Then they may ask the teacher that they prefer working in the hall because the noise in the class is to distracting to them. The key is when it comes to doing something you must keep busy to reach that goal of finishing or being done. There are going to be some challenges, but you just need to overcome those challenges and learn from it its all about learning and progressing as you keep working towards it. These are some of the reasons i think would help best to keep moving forward."
1168,5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us.

New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think it's also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes.

Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation.

Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing.

My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents won't be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents won't have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that don't they are going t get used to it. Thats going to help every students and people from outside are goin to see the changes in the school and others schools should start doing the same for their students. Healthy life with less risk of everything. This is my sincerity opinion and hopefully the Principal takes some ideas of what the students think and what is the best for all of us. Thank you !"

I could see the nice green grass moving side to side, smell the fresh air, and see the pretty nice tall green trees giving a nice long shadow to the ground. I can tell people were having a lot of fun by their smiles on their face, and by running up and down the field. I can see people are having fun it made me want to have fun too. I remember the first time I went to the Community Park, then I went to the State Park, and also I went to the National Park.

The first reason, is when I went to the the Community Park for the first time. I could see this big blue, and yellow playground. Also I could see people running up and down at the Community Park having so much of fun. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. Lastly, the Community Park had so many fun equipment to play. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park.

Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. I could remember walking under the trees with a nice wind blow to my face in a nice shadow made by the trees. Also I kept walking and I saw a lot of animals that were not attacking people. Animals that I saw were Frogs, Turtle, Fish, Lobsters, Birds, Snakes, Deer, and Ducks all over the park. Lastly, I saw their was a big river where people were fishing. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park.

Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. The park has a lot of fun things that we can go look at and visit animals at the park. The animals they can go and visit are Monkeys, Snakes, Giraffes, Turtles, Tigers, Pandas, Birds, Frogs, Crocodiles, Gorillas, Sea Lions, Donkeys, Horses, Lions, Lizards, Iguana, and Elephants. Lastly, the National Park has food stands were we can go and buy food if we get hungry at anytime. We can take brakes if we get tired of walking in the National Park and sit down.

In conclusion, enjoying the outdoors is very fun because we can go and visit a lot of different Parks. I will never forget the first time I went to the Community Park, State Park, and the National Park because it's a very fun way to enjoy the outdoors day. I will never forget playing at the Community Park playground that day. I will never forget walking at the State Park river that day. Lastly, I will never forget looking at does pretty animals at the National Park that day."

Guiding students for what they like since a young age is an acceptable idea because they learn more and more each day. Their mentality is improving each day. For example: They try to look for information, asking people that already have experiences with the career that they are thinking to take. After Middle School and High School students are ready to start college and they should be assuming what is best for them.

In some parts of the world teenagers do not have the opportunity to go to school, countries that do not have good recursive, for example: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Africa. In those kind of countries many teenagers do not go to school because they prefer to work beside of going to school, their education is not good enough. That is why so many people come to U.S. because they know that the education that U.S brings them is their future. Each Teenager comes with a dream to U.S. Kids at age of 12 of those countries comes with big mentalities with big dreams, that is what helps many teenagers to choose a good career in U.S, at young age they know that they have to make their family proud and be the alpha of the family with a good career. Also as the population in those countries is increasing day by day is harder to find a job even if you had a good diploma it do not matters. The society in those countries when kids want to go to school their parents don't let them, ""the education here is not going to guide you anywhere"" that is what they said, that is why now days are many terrorism in many countries because parents takes the dreams of their children and through them to the trash. Many parents should give teenagers the opportunity of studying and talk them about how important is to have a good education and let them think about the career that they want at young age.

The importance of knowing and thinking about the future at young age has been an impact in now days, because in many cases around the world teenagers do not think about their future, they do not care about school, jobs, education, or their family, but in U.S teenagers have many chances of getting a good job and getting a good healthy life and a great education.

Teenagers will have their life set after High School.

Teenagers are going to be an inspiration for others.

They will have a good job.

Ensuring that students should have their career in mind by the time that they enter to High School for them to learn more and preparing when they get to college and learn much more and be an inspiration for many other teenagers and for others to think of the importance of having a good education and career. "
268,136B3124BE79,"In my opinion the students can't go to college when they are too young, they don't have too much experience, those societies have to accept the reason why they are too young to think about a career, they cannot expected something that is different just think about it, the reason they are young it doesn't mean they can have a though about their career yet.

1, They don't have too much experience.

ex: When your'e in school the only thing that you have to think is in your grades, and your classes ,so that's why your experience is not count because there is no experience for it.

2. They are too young to think to go college.

ex: Sometimes your age counts a lot when your'e thinking about college because when you are older you can think clear what you want for your future.

3. Not every student have any plan to college some of them can go. but other student have different thoughts.

ex: No all of the students likes go to school. so they cannot have though like have plan to take a career..

Students of high school can't expect what they want for their future, this can make harder the things because students can already start to think about college that can make more complicated, each student is different some of them want a career other don't wanna go to college they just want get a work and get money, so is impossible all the student want go at college when are too young. The experience always have point because if you don't know what you want for your future, it can make more difficult the things. Everything has to be less desperate, because your are young can a have lot of options at end. "
3305,E52BA6E4D7EE,"Technology in people's live.

Technology have a positive effects in people's live, make you do thing better and easy, like if you don't want to go to the library you can read a book in the internet, or if yo don't want to go to the store and buy something you can buy that thing online technology is one of the more important thing in the world for many reasons, doctors use the technology to help you wen you have a problem and see what it is, or in the airports to see if you don't have something illegal if places like this don't use the technology is very complicate to do the job and more time to due.

In school we net the computer all of the time to do the homework and test and now is an important thing to have if you are in the school and no't only in the school also people that work from home or in any other job they net the technology, most of the job in this time net a computer, or any other type of technology, some people say that technology make negative effects in people life but on my opinion is not true because must of the people who say that use the technology to say that is bad and affect the population.

I know the must of the people use the technology, or sometime of their live they use the technology and the technology help they to do something,a lot of the medicament that we know on this days are create for the technology, technology is not only computers and phones technology can be something pretty simple like a clock, is not necessary has to ve something very sophisticate, some people say that if you use the technology you don't have contact whit other people and something is true but that happen when you use the technology to much, but it does't mean that technology is bad if you use appropriate.

What people net is responsibility to use the technology and know when they net to use, that way we can be more sophisticates, we can use the technology to talk, play video games,etc but we can also have time to stay whit the family and friends."
2797,CC8647F0D1E1,"Should the school board add one and a half hours to school each day?

School should not be extended any longer than it already is! Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with a hour added its going to be much more difficult.

The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With a hour and a half students would probably get to much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!!

Because the school board wants to add an hours more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress. Without an hour added, it would give so much relief to alot of parents that wont have to fight for what they believe the school board should do with the time schedule."
2864,CFEC920440CE,"We accomplish more by doing tasks that we are assigned with to complete.

We have always get something done if the tasks or assignments are done.

Take for example people that work jobs, day and night they tend to get work or tasks or assignments done.

How do they get stuff done, workers usually plan it out like steps to go though to complete them if they dont follow the steps like how are they going to complete the task or assignment to get it done. Workers always need to plan it out before proceeding to the task or assignment to finish or complete. For example Generic_Name wants to figure out how to complete his project, he need to plan step by step and what materials he needs for the project. He follows the step by step plan but realizes what he needs to do later on he gathers the materals and starts to complete his project just by always doing it.

All of us always have to something to complete any tasks or assignments to finish.

It's not going to work if we dont always doing something or plan it out , it's the reason why if you wanna get it stuff done you have always do it in order complete it. For example take school students for a example, they tend to always to get work done so they can free time to themselves and usually making sure the answers they write down are correct to get good grades. School students have determation to complete classwork they're assigned to, so later on they don't have to complete it for homework at home for free time. It's better to always complete work so you don't have to complete later on. For example any job work usually has work to do like car manufactures , they have a assembly to work on because it's where the cars are starting to be made by the workers in the assembly line. They have to work the machines to put the parts on the cars that are being work on so it can shipped of to the car dealership. Everything revolves around on always getting something on time, so it doesn't become a problem later on. Everyone like to job workers to school students alwayss have to something , its why we tend to get stuff done.

Always accomplish it by doing it

Reasons why, we have to do it if we tend to get our task or assignments done then that work doesn't get it the way of what you are trying to on the next task. Accomplishing that we are trying to get to is a good way to start off, you see like CEOs of a company planning what they want done and to figure it how to accomplish it. For example take CEOs they're good at getting stuff done and accomplished it pefectly cause they own businesses and tell his workers what food products or drinks that stores need for people to attract to buy their goods or clothes. People always have to plan to work towards to they want to achieve or accomplish even for their future. it's not going to work if you don't put the effort into the assignment or tasks to make it happpen. You always have to make sure what you want and to make it happen so that your future has more opportuniites.

In conclusion Always put the effort into it so you can accomplish on any work,task, assignments that you can achieve later on in your life."
1733,83165647126E,"One way to improve student achievement is to create a homework club. I think making a homework club is wonderful for students a homework club can help students improve their grades,have more free time,

less tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time.

First, of all, establishing a homework club is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. They also, get to study more and don't have to worry about failing the test. Lets say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with.

Also, students have more free time after school. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. A homework club sounds like a club i would join because after i come home i'd relax or go out or hangout with some friends. if i joined a club like that i'd be happy because i wouln't be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we don't understand.

Furthermore, A homework club helps students less tired. They don't need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. Just imagine what their going through right now.

Next, Homework clubs and help students on many different things but at least they learn something new. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they can't do anything. I

believe every student has the courage to get something they done just like that.

Finally, I think creating a homework club is great for the students because it helps students improve their grades, give them more free time when they get home, less tired from school, and grateful that they have this club.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name"
1980,960D7C072801,"Hello Mr. Manager I would like to vist your work space. Visiting your work space could help me learn about how you work and everything. Visiting your work space can help others understand what your do. Visiting your company could help understand how things are made at your company and what your goal is for the future of your company. This visit will help me understand how the people are too.

Visiting your company could help people understand what you do at your work space. Looking at a work space can help people see what the company is working on. Also at a company while they are working help people see how things are here and if they like it or not. Letting people see your work space will let them know what kind of company this is.

Opening your company to people would help them understand what kind of things you need to work here. This could help chosing colleges and schools. Instead of wasting time looking all the colleges looking here could help narrow the options a bit. Knowing what course to take will help me pick what college I want and will help me narrow the list instead of looking all over the place.

Letting people vistit your company would them see what your working on. Letting them come in and everything could help them know what they might be getting in the future. Helping people understand is a good way to keep your company out there in the world."
1669,7EEB8E9614C2,"In my opinion do we accomplish is if we are doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things.

First, if you are always doing something you can have what you want you. For example, if you want to buy the car of your dreams, you want a big house is gonna cost too much money but if you have a good job and you doing well in what you do, you can have a car if you want or a house however if you do not want to accomplish you never gonna have something. So, you need to always doing something if you want to accomplish.

Second, you can keep learning new things in life, in the school if you still are in there and even in your job. For example in your job if you are new you need to learn how you gonna your own work and if you do to want to learn you never gonna be good in what you doing or in the school, when i start go to the High School i was scared because I doesn't spoke English but I started to doing something and now I speak is not the most better English but is work.

In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because if you are always doing something you can have what you want and you can always keep learning new things. "

Some people have a hard life more when they trying to be better because some of them feel like they are failure by not having a good jod, or by living in a bad place.

Firts, for some peolpe is hard to find a good jod that they can really appreciate be good finalcially. To be sure that they can have evething they want for life because soometimes people try get somenthing but they can't. It's better to force their self to get whta they really want. For example if tey trying to go out they have to make sure they dont have anydebitos they having pay yet.

Second, some peolpe that livi in a bad place is depend by the econom. Some of them says they loss the enthusiasm by not having a good palce.

Thinking about pleople that really do thinks in live to get a good life is depend on they record. For example the people that go out and find hte way to move from they old life they had to take alot of choice. Or have making alot of bad choises to get something they do have now.

For the people that have evething is more easy to do the things they have i their mind.

On the way tha they can doevething they like or they want. but the enthusiasm they will have will be alot of better them what others can have.

2807,CD4135EAFB1E,"A Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow. Some will said you'll grow but won't reach their beyond what they mastered. Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will never stop you from doing it. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. The instrument that I'm now play is Villain my brother though I wasn't good enough to play a instrument. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didn't started learning until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you don't understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better. I grew up become better the thing I love the most and did it because I had sibling following my foot step since I was the oldest in my family."
3786,FA9E315D7939,"Some school dictrict shifted to a four day week and at ten hour for day, not because fo fenancial needs, but other did so to make it earser to schedule soporting event or after-school activities. On my opinion, my school should follow the model by extending the school day two hours. Beacuase they conserver enegy and resources.

The benefist of goint to a four-day week and ten hours day for schooling, is that if offers teacher and students an additional day of rest every week. More rest then equates to dealing with less strees over the courses of a school year. Students feel lees pressure, because they have more time to study at their own place at home, especially in the later grades. For example, I am senior in my school, if my school follow this model I will have more time for work in my homework.

The disadvantages of four-day week and ten hours day. Shifting do this schedule does have centain disadvantages, especially for the working parent. For the parents of yourger student, an aditional full day of daycare nay need be schoduled very weed Instead of a partial day this leads to added costs that some families, living paycheck to paycheck, may not be able to afford.

In conclusion, the school be should the four-day week and extending the school day two hours.     "
3283,E4124757C2B0,"I

disagree with adding one and half hour to school each day because students would get tired and it would be more things to the students have to know.

In our school we have 9 hours of school and if we add it would have 10 and I don't think students want to stay in school for a long time. I get that school is a place where you learn and school get's you a job and you can get a free scholarships to college without paying but at the same time students need 7 hours maximum so they would fit all the knowledge and all the subjects in there mind.

Teachers want students to learn more because they want student's to have a successful life and learn more but student's have less time to listen because they want to go home .In our school we have 4 subjects were we have tests and some students fail it because there studying for other classes even though it's not important like for example,elective classes,I get that elective is important to but students but it's really not important. The important classes are Math,Science and Language arts, and History. The school board is not gonna like when students fail there tests when they have 10 hours in school each day. Students should have time when they get home to study so they can ace there test,Since our school is a Middle school we should have less hours so we can pass 6th,7th and 8th grade without having any difficult in school.

Students wouldn't benefit if the time is longer they would not even pay attention to the teacher so i disagree with having one and half hour to school each day. On the other hand,I think i could agree to this because in order to become successful you have to study and work really hard and get enough to time to do your work.

I think students would go to college if they had a lot of time and students would understand things better we should have a vote where students decide whether we should have one and a half hour or not so then the school board can see which one got the highest votes and they would decide if we should have a longer time or regular time. This year a lot of students are getting bad grades because there is so many tests and works they have to do and it's always do on time so i feel like we should have less time in school so when you get home you have a study time.

The school board will like this idea because being in school for us is so much and there is no point for staying 10 hours in school because teachers would get tired and students will get bored. Students have a lot of work they have to do so it's better to stick with 9 hours of school and let student's go home and do there homework and then read and study for the next day of school."
1953,935A26E2610C,"Do you think that the first impression can change my statement?

some people change the statement with the impressions for to made best result or to have a bets answer, therefore not all people can make this possible,

but while the people always try the bets.

i'm disagree because, based on my experience some time i said my first impression, and its hard to change, but is not impossible all is possible if you try the best, my mom said that you always have to change the first impression if is not correct.

My mom said that you always have to change the first impression, because you will be more secure of what you doing, and your life will be more better, and safe, I remember that she always toll me becarefool of what you choice, because that what you do in the present will affect your future.

Some time you have to think of what you choice, and i choice that i'am disagree, because i said if you think two time your impression your impression will be better if you said a best impression, so you have to think what you said because if is not correct you will have a big problem.

Should the people said the first impression, but if you see that you first impression is not correct you have to change the first impression, and make a better impression, because two is better than one. "
2855,CF453C152FD5,"This is an easy choice technology has a negative affect on people. There are many reason why but three big ones are. one you lose a lot of communication skills. another is you only see things through your phone. And finally you lose family time or time with friends .

The first reason is people lose communication skills. such as you dont see people face to face you are just texting them and you dont know how to talk to them in person so you dont hang out with them you just text them. and they pretty much just a become and online friend. another example of this is during a job interview you don't know how to talk to someone. it's really hard to do stuff when someone doesn't have communication skills. and you can get food online so you won't have to talk to people.

most people just see things and hear about stuff thats happening. don't go and explore or experience thing the just go on the Internet. because everything around us is technology based. you can't go anywhere without the internet or a TV. so everyone has gotten used to that so they don't have a need to go out or play outside if they have games on there phone,computer,iPad. so people don't have to travel because you can face time people or use other apps to see people. you can order food from uber eats so you don't have to leave your house and people won't know how it feel to be in a restaurant.

finally people wont be spending time with family because of the internet. because someone could be watching a YouTube video and then another then after a while it could be dark outside and you just lost the day and havent said anything to your parents because you have been watching YouTube or Netflix. people get used to that life style and a lot people won't change because its become a habit and its a bad habit to over come. people also forget about there friends because they just wanna be on there phone alone watching videos,playing games , watching TV. and you forget about family and friends not on purpose and you still do it without knowing. And its not just kids it's also adults. They pay everything online so they only leave for work and nothing else. then come back order food or get groceries online. and cook while watching TV or on Facebook ."
2529,BBB9D66F934C,"So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School.

Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen.

So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice

So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50

chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year"
2704,C71E90669DFA,"Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. Problem is not rare this days. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. I have several reasons why I agree on Duke's statement. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes.

Problems make us work/push harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better"". Problems make us to push harder. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it.

My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. Problems make us create goal to achieve. My brother and me are a great example of that. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again.

Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. Because before problems mistakes comes first. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Then, when I know what's the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. When you learned your mistakes and don't create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". Brain and feelings are created so we can't make the same mistakes as before. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life.

My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. All of these reasons are very important to know. So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us go together and help each other. Humans are created to enjoy life and learn from problems to problems."
912,462769ABDD5B,My opinion about performing a community service is that they should have a community service. i think that they should have that because the a community service gives a help to the community because helping out in the community is very good and could give a good help to residents in the community because some communities have old people or even paralised person which can't help out in the community. So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.

Doing just one thing, they never try something new they mind be thought the in the future wouldbe use less or they just don't feel like they actully need it but if you get more experiences you will grow as a person and besed on experiences too.

For example. When you start growing u learn a lot of things that make you a better person. You know that there is a person that want to learn new things, even if he's young but you know things like that adults know that make you be a older person. In the way that you know things that persons that have you same age not , but you know that you have some other responsabilities, because based on what you know you life have to about on that things that you know or you make or that things that you learn.

For example, you go to school that is a place where you learn and where you been intul you graduate because if you know more you have more oportunities to be succecful, and i'm agree on his coment why? let told you the reason. A lot of people never try new things like if you are a teacher and after like 5 years you don't feel like to teach more. you can try to be something else that help you to grow more based on experiences because if you try more things like other jobs or try to study something else like gona be rich on experience because many people sometimes get stuck on one thing but everything in this world have a solution but to get your goals is not a easy thing you have to sacrifed many things that you love.

For example your hoobies or your family or other events, but at the end of the day you have everything you ever wish becuse you deservet and you work so hard to get it. And you start see the succes that you have. You would see that all you did to get there was correct and that make you grow because you have more experience. Nothing is inpossible. For example if you are the owner of a little restaurant and you want to your restaurant grow more, and more but you remenber that you study bussines and also you work for a restaurant and on that restaurant you were a manager, so you have the experience and if you know how spend money and you make a good marketing plan you can be succesfull and you will growing as a person and as experiences.

In addition I think he's right becuase how I been saying if you know more you have experience and you can a have better jobs and that way you growing you have oportunities more chances to be a better on your life and unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Based on your experiences."
2361,AF8963C142A0,"Benefits on working with a group is a better way to get work done because most students get to use different ideas,Helping each other out with different parts on projects finishing work faster,and communicating with each other is key if working in groups.

However not everyone would agree with this position, because it benefits of working alone is most students don't have to wait on others to do their work. For example The teacher assignes a project and they have to be in groups of five and two of the students do their work and the other three don't do their work. It brings everyone else down.

Working alone makes students not have to worry about others not doing their part of the work.

Most students get to use different ideas when they work on groups. For example students get together to start talking about how they are going work together and start giving differents ideas on how to work better as a group

Working in a group makes students jobs less complicated and stressful by having others helping each other

Working in groups students get to help each other out. For example each student gets to be in charge of one part of the assignment so everyone contributes and work gets done faster. Helping each other out is really important to the group and communication is key when students work in groups.

Communication with each student in the group is really important if students working in groups want to get work done. For example each member of the group comminicates with each other and work gets done faster. Communication helps in different ways,helping someone if they don't understand something,Giving advice to another student if they feel like they are stuck or need a different opinnion or not agreeing with someone else there's always a different way to communicate that to each other. communication is key to work in groups.

Working in groups benefits one another by working faster, communicating with each other, helping each other out when someone is not understanding something and giving different ideas. Working in groups can be helpfull if students know how to use it and take advantage of the opportunnity. It should be the best way to get work done and be able to help each other out. "

Some students would be affected by the change. Students that work after school are going to be affected by the change. and that also will affected the income that the students have to help their parents, if the students work less hours their income would be affected.

Also students help their parents taking care of their sibling after school, some times also students help their parents at home as clean the floor, wash dishes, make dinner and time for their hobbies, made the life of the students more easy at schools and at home.

students that like to do sports after school as soccer, fotbool, basquelbal, or tennis, some just wants to have a little time of peace by themselves as reading or walking alone those little thing is what a student can miss but if teachers decide to extended the schools to hours late, students also are going to work the same amount of time the only different is that they have to work to hour more each day to complete the forty hours work for week, and those two hours would private students to do what they like to do and make the life more happy.

considering the idea of work after schools some students need that income to help parents bring food over the table this is what some of the mothers do time ago, look the possibility of help their parents by working a little part time and getting food for their tables, always think that those mothers are heroes that god put aver the earth to do the best they can for help their parents, amazing some students already have the opportunity of study because their parents already pay the price of work hard and now we have the opportunity of have a better future.

2370,AFF314E99BF2,"seeking multiple ideas can be good because...

they can give you good ideas and you can see that people think different.

you will be able to have multiple choices to pick from and make the right decision.

you can even meet new people while your at it and also they can help you see it in another perspective.

Are you having a hard time deciding something? if you are you should talk to other people and see what they think its good to see what others think because, they can help you decide and give you great ideas,for example i had a friend and she would help me decide all the time and she would give out great ideas and i would pick the right decision with her help.

Also they can give you ideas and you can decide what is the best one and you can make the right decision and see what is the best idea and you can make the right decision not just that but you can see how others think and they might think different from how you think for example if you think that chocolate is better and your friend thinks strawberry is better then you should give a try and see if you made the right decision by picking strawberry instead of chocolate or she might be wrong and chocolate is better then strawberry but you will never know in till you try it.

Perhaps they can help you see things in another perspective,also you can make new friends while your at it,but not just that you can share your ideas as well and they can see what you think and help you out if your stuck and they will tell you if your doing something wrong and help you out and see it in another perspective,you might think that going to the movies is better and your friend might think that staying at home and watching a movie is better and she starts telling you why its better and you end up staying home and watching a movie because the reason she gave you where good.

You should give new things a try to because you will never know if its a good idea or not just ask your friends on what you should do during the weekend and they will help you and you will be able to try new things and take new ideas from that and its also nice to talk to someone and share ideas it will keep your mind off things and you wont be as stressed because you will have someone helping you.

those are the reason i think you should be seeking ideas not just from one person but from more and i think you should give it a try and see how it goes and hopefully it goes well because it works for me so give it a try hopefully i helped you see things in another perspective.       "
2929,D2FB14A7C43B,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" However, it is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influences by others. It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do.

First reason is, People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influence by others. For example, my friend

Generic_Name has a son, who according to her he wants to be a lawyer. Generic_Name husband who's name is Generic_Name is a lawyer. Although their son Generic_Name is taking only math classes in collage, which it has nothing to do with laws. Generic_Name and Generic_Name want to influence Generic_Name to become a lawyer. But Generic_Name is being influence by his Algebra class teacher. Generic_Name has a very high score on math, and his Algebra teacher believe that Generic_Name can be a math teacher in a college. Generic_Name teacher knows how hard he works to do everything right and how his behavior it is showed.

Another reason is, It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. For example, when my brother was nine years old he wanted to be a Pilot, but he was just really scared of heights. When my brother graduated from high school he wanted to go to Army. Somehow my mom find out that he really did not wanted to do that what he really wanted to do was being a Pilot. My mom is a Flight Attend and she told my brother that some people will say you are too weak to do this and that, but they actually does not know what you are capable to do. With those words my mom influence my brother, and now he is a Pilot and he works for the Air Force. My mom gave him an example that no one believed on her the only person who believed on her was her mom. As my mom says, "" Don't let other people think you are not able to do things, which they we're not able to do.""

Some people may think that there are better ways to influence others. However, it can be true, but people get more influence by examples. There are not many ways for example, if someone who is very important who wants to influence someone else who is not that important to be come important as they are. Does not mean this person is going to have the same luck to become really important. Do not let other people influence you by other ways, let them give you an example of how you are going to success.

In conclusion, It is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. To teach them what it is good and what it is wrong to do. Given your own examples and teach them how to behave. Dot let people think that example is not the main thing to influence others."
2180,A2CAB9C551B9,"""I would identify you playing an online game such as cahoot, coolmath, and theres lot of other games you could play online that will help you learn something. The thing is the games are fun to play and are educational. Examples would be Cahoot is this game where you and your classmates play the teacher gives questions and whoever gets the most right wins at the end of the game sometimes the Teacher might give you a reward for winning. There is also coolmath it's not one particular game but its a website with tons and tons of games you can play math games there really fun.

The games are fun because you get to play with your friends and specially on cool math there is this one game where your a cube and you have to run and theres levels it helps you with geometry. ""I would say lots of people that go to public schools have played that game because it's just that popular and fun. Especially cahoot every kid that attends a public school has played this game either to study or just have some free time.

""Im not just saying you have to play games to have fun while being educational but it does really help a person out some kids would just rather maybe get a book or do the work straight up and thats also good but sometimes you could enjoy playing games and those games are enjoyable and help you learn to ""I really suggest them. But there are other things like doing a science experiment you could find interesting things that you never knew before, also playing an instrument ""if you enjoy music thats really fun you can learn how to play a instrument,You could also be in a play if you like acting anything that fits your interest and is educational you should try it.

"" I also identified math , chest , and science fairs. First we will talk about Math , when your good at math and want to compete against other students or just learn more and be good at math there usually pretty fun when you finally get to know all that stuff its a great experience.

""Now we will talk about chest , chest itself is a really fun board game you have to use your brain to make good plays and focus on what your doing why its fun is when you become good at the game or already are it gets easy and enjoyable. You can win money from chest if your competing for your school or maybe a team they have tournaments and you can win money which is great because everyone wants some type of money.

""Last one science fairs making volcanoes erupt, making just in total something amazing which you can show your whole school thats pretty cool. Why its enjoyable is because when you make something cool your peers around you get to see it and if your good at stuff like that you will most likely enjoy it."
2747,CA11FD3CAC43,"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age.

Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good life's quality.

Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Once again, if students have the school's support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have.

So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school."
108,07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?""

When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up.

When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When I'm sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher.

When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones.

When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school.

Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us. "

Students effort to do their work. They when are absent, they stay after school with their teachers to complete their work missed. Some students praise when they need to do something good but they study first and then they praise to have good grade or something like that. They sometimes don't like to do their homeworks in breaks.

Students try to get more energy to do that. They are eat breakfast in the morning. They bring some snack to their house. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. Some studens need help to their teachers and they help them. They need to organize their work when the teacher give some papers.

Students work all the time to get the best work. They study after school at home. They do their homework and they practice some exercise when they have some break or when they complete their all work. Some students go to the library and get some books to read about the class, they need to pass.

426,205D590BCBB1,"Community, state, national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities. I will write about an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. I will use specific details and examples, to explaing why someone might find that activity enjoyable.

For my opinion i think i will like to have a community, state, national park that has two fields. One basketball field with soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot. Then last but not least a tennis court. That would be cool.

Then i will want the parks/play ground, to be split in two. One small play ground for little childrens under 9 years old.

And then the other one will be for kids above 10 years old.

Now i will describe what will i want to look like or have on the babies' play ground from a 2/3 year old kid to 9.

kids and parents will like to have tiny slides of a hight of 3 or 4 feet tall and have sings that are special for babeis'. Then little benches were they can sit with there parents. After that i will like does little horses made of plastic or metal, that you can move back and forth.

Then now i will tell you and describe you how can kids will love kids to have on the other park or play ground from kids from 10 and above.

So maybe kids will love to have two fields' because maybe they like to play soccer or basketball and tennis so one of them will be a basketball field with small soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot because a lot of kids like soccer and basketball. Then the other field will be a tennis field. What kids will love too is have to courts on one field too. Then for the slide i want four of the to have a hight about 6 or 7 feet tall and two with curls and the other two, just normal.

Then the other biggest ones will be of a high of 10 feet tall and i will promise you that kids will love it!

So they don't get bord and say; this is boring. This is for little kids, i don't like it!.

So this is what i think that chlidrens will like to play on. That is all i wanted to say."
3714,F7DF6ABE8573,"I strongly believe that technology is positive on human life because of all the effects it had on us in the past and present. Such as: technological advancements, you can talk to people easier, caused scientific break throughs which made us go further in life, and it also gave us security or protection.

The technological advancements are practically everywhere because everything we use is technology. It has helped us with new vehicles that could possibly be more fuel efficient and possible will create more safety in the cars since it's easy to hurt someone in a crash. It helped us in school and made us understand things such as looking up answers you dont know or checking when the next test is. It inspires people to think of other ways we can advance our technology state currently.

Its really easy to talk to people because it doesnt take that much effort in order to have a conversation. The news is one example because it tells us whats happening even if they are far away from us, we can still hear them. The weather could change into a disaster and they would tell us to evacuate. It allows us to talk to relatives that live in other areas or countries. It could let us see political debates and see whats happening in other areas.

Without technology we wouldn't have had any scientific break throughs because it moslty helped us with everything in life. An example of this would be us landing on the moon which is a important day for the people because it showed that we could do really big things. If people did not take the time to study and think about the different scenarios then we would not have those outcomes. It helps us by looking up something we dont understand on the internet and in five seconds you could finally understand whatever you were trying to look up.

One thing that makes us feel safe would be your own home but what if someone broke in and had bad intentions. There would be an alarm system that would ring and call the police to indicate that there was a intruder. It gives us security by giving us locks on important things such as banks so no one can enter it unless they knew your password or any other necessity.

Technology definitely played a huge role in our daily life and the evidence shows because everything we do involves technology or is something about technology. I strongly believe that technology doesn't stop human interaction but helps builds it up. I think this because we can text friends, text family, work on a project, or do school related stuff with it. If we keep on making up better technology or improve it then I believe it will make discover or invent big things that will push us into the future."
2323,ACE1BE41A8E0,"One of the most famous quote by Thomas Jefferson is, "" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believes that there is so much that can be done if we are always doing something because if you are doing something all the time even if it's little it can be done but may take time. I believe we accomplish more if we are always doing something for example if you don't practice everyday then you won't get better at soccer. There is a lot of things that need be done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism , if we do something about that everyday to end racism.

If you are always doing something then you will get a lot done. When your building a house you are always doing something to it but if you stop then it will more time to build. I always believed that i can do a lot if i'm doing something all the time. When i was little i use to make Lego's i would always build them, i was always doing something to them. My mom always told if i'm building them everyday i could get done fast. I prepare for school the same way when i have big projects. When i have big projects i tend to freak out. My mom tells to just break it down and do little bit of everyday. When i do that i get my projects done fast.

If you don't practice everyday then yo won't get better at soccer. If you want to be professional soccer you will have to work everyday. When you don't do that you won't get any better because you have to train everyday so you can be great at soccer. I use to play soccer 2 years ago and i wasn't practicing everyday so i did't get any better. My dream was to be a soccer player but i wasn't training everyday so i didn't get where i wanted too. Everyone has dream to be something in order be that you have to do something everyday to reach your dream. Most people don't make their dreams because they don't do the little things that matter everyday.

There is a lot that need to done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism. I believe we can end racism by doing something about it everyday. One of the most important things in this country is racism because a lot people are getting killed by it. Police officer shooting black men that didn't do anything. That causes people that have been killed family's pain. I think racism needs to end as soon as possible. A lot white police men are shooting black men and are not getting anything for it. I think they should at least get some punishment because it's not fair to the people who died family's. I believe this could be fixed if we all come together and do something about it everyday.

As you have read we accomplish more when we are always doing something. Only when we do something you accomplish more. By doing something everyday you can accomplish your dreams and get your work done. The world would be in better place if we everyone did something to make the world more cleaner and safe. "
943,483EE18C996B,"As I'm part of Generic_City community, the majority of students have been changing the opinions about the transformation of our cafeteria foods that will occur. Recently the cafeteria have decided to become a new healthier school lunch menu by eliminating some of the students' favorite cafeteria foods and providing a completely new meats. This change is a good idea, I'am certain this action was taken to awareness as students to eat healthier also to build a efficient body .

Eating healthier will make people aware of the fact that they must change their meats and life routine, Also it encourages them to practice sports as the athletes students and at some point they will prefer so much to take care of their health by dieting, being familiar with the vegetables, fruits, and milk. And going to the gym constantly on purpose to build a beautiful body.

In addition, Eating unhealthier causes the disperses and the isolation when we became adults. Furthermore, this strategic will reduce the percentage of getting cancers and dangerous diseases in the future due to lack of knowledge of nutrition. Being fat makes our life more difficult imperfection, and tiny. It is so necessary to be flexible and active in our life. the spastics says that many people die young cause of heart attack that occurred from the unhealthy food such as the poison ingredients.

My primary reason that i support this action is the important of eating healthy. it increases our intelligence the students will notice their progress in school by paying more attention in the classroom. Also, it benefices our beauty of body by making the person looks much better and attractive. and it makes us feel so much powerful in our life.

In conclusion, Many students are affirmative with this action, whereas there are many students criticize it too.

i'am going to support highly this idea by making them aware of its importance.        "
1296,63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.

Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.

If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.

Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.

Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.

The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping."
3182,DFB7AB4481AC,"I think that people can success without having the cosists of failure without loss of enthusiam. There's other way to success without failing, one of them is to practice. An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study other's failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isn't wrong, there's still other success with out failure.

First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you can't success to be the best soccer player if you don't practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, you'll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure.

Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, there's some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it.

Another way people can success, is by watching other's failure and success. When you watch other's failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldn't have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You don't just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure.

So Winston isn't wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making you'll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time.

So I don't agree with Churchill's statement, because their is more then just failure to success. There's so much way to success with having to fail. You can practices, study other's failure and success, and sometime success on you first time by winging it. So those are some reason, why i don't agree with Winston Churchill."
459,22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

I think,student should go to school because I believe that we can do better when we do thing that not just read books or study at home but we should go to school fore getting better.         "
933,474D243CD03A,"Every students expect that they are going to have a great time in a summer break. Some students enjoy their long summer vacation because they do not have to worry about the school for a while. But some students want to reduce summer vacation and have longer breaks in winter, spring, and fall. There are some pros and cons on both sides, but I agree with long summer vacation and short breaks in winter and spring. Among the numerous reasons, my most important reasons are students cannot make a long time plan during the vacation; it is not effective to have a short shcool time and then have a break.

One of my most important reason is that students cannot make a long time plan during the vacation. I believe that many students want to go travel or want to tour other countries with a long time plan, but if they have short vacation, they have to worry about the assignment and school while they are traveling. Sometimes, it is hard to see everything you want with a short time, so you regret that you did not have bunch of time. If one of their family lives in another country and it is hard to see each other, they have to make a plan to have a wonderful time with each other during the break. They, obviously, want to stay together for a long time because they do not know when they are going to meet each other again; It could be next year or 10 years later. They, however, cannot enjoy their time as much as they want if the student have to go back early. Because of these evidences, I agree with the long summer vacation.

Another my most important reason is that it is not effective to have a short school time and then have a break. Every sports have a season and the players or coaches focus on their duty during the season; they do not have a break for like 3-4 weeks because of their body rhythm. I believe that it works for students, too. For example, people who want to be good at music instruments have to practice consistently; practicing 10 hours a day and doing nothing for a week does not help you at all. Even though the practicing time is shorter, using the instruments everyday reminds you and help you to get better. It is hard to come back to school after having a long break, but it is more effective when the students change their body rhythm for the school time than having a short break after a short school time. Because of these evidences, I agree with the long summer vacation.

There are some advantages on the other opinion because not every single person has the same studying style. Some of the students study very hard during the short time period and then take a break, and it works for them. However, this type of studying has a risk that the students can forget what they have learned during the break because they tried to put much informations like math, science, english, and history in a short time. Even though the students who cram for the tests or assignments can get a good grade, they have to go over it after few moments later. Therefore, it is better to have a long summer vacation than a short summer vacation.

As I mentioned, summer break is what students' best time in a whole year. Almost every students makes their own plans on what they should do. Students, however, have a difficult before they have a summer vacation, so some of them want to reduce the summer break and make longer the other breaks. It is not a bad idea to move on, but they have to know that taking longer breaks in winter and fall would affect their whole summer plans. They also have to realize that they can do much more thing with longer break. That depends on how people use their own time, but if you have longer break it would give you wide opportunity.                                                 "
3740,F8FE459205F4,"Do you agree with churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

Should i agree that when someone fail and if they continuo doing what they were doing they will success later on?

I'm agree because when you make mistakes you'll learnd from it, and next time when you do it you will be better than what have you done in the past. If you are a failure and if you keep trying then i'm proud of you because thats the mean that you're in the good path and that you'll achive your goals soon. My reasons are nobdy is perfect and no one will be perfect ever, my second reason is even famous people have fail and now they're in the top, and my tird reason is there are some people who like to accomplish their dreams by working hard and never letting other people stop them.

To start with nobody is perfect, is because we all can make mistakes and also because it is okay to make mistakes, no one had died because they fail doing something like work from school or stuff from work. So it is like when you go to other country and you have to try new things like their languge, their food. their traditions and all the stuff that their country have and I konw that sometimes to feel like you'll never be like them, you'll never understand what they are saying, but it is false because I am a immigrant, I came to the United States when I was 14 years old not knowing any english, with only one person by my side that was my mom, and leaving everything behind. For one moment I think that I was never going to get used to this country, that I was never going to understand english and that I was never going to be enough to this country but now I can say that I can speak english I can writte in english and that all the people (brothers,and sister)

that I left behind I still love and that someday I will returned and I will tell them everything.

To continuo with famous people had failed in their past, and i'm saying this is people I know that to be where they are now they have done alot of work and they've done alot of sacrifices too like leaving their family behind because they did no support them or maybe because they didn't like that profession, friends becuase some of them are fake or maybe because they want to help them to progress, maybe schools need to be more focus about they work like wrinting songs or even focusing more in their dance, works because you need to choose the one that you like more, and I can tell that it did not stop them, they keep fighting to be better each day to give all the best about them to have a mentality about progress. I've seen alot of famous videos about people that I like and i've cried because some of their stories are really sad and I know what they where feeling that time. You can follow famous people and i admire them because they have fail millions of time and they've never stop doing what they love to do.

To finallice with that if you are one of those persons who like to accomplished dreams then you should never give up because thats what looser (mediocre) people do, they give up when they see that something is hard or maybe because they are shy about them how they look like if they are pretty or no or maybe because they don't like their work because the people is mean or their managge is agressive in the term how he express so they decide to quit. We always tried to put the best and to be the best of us even when you know that you can fail, that there are other people that are good too but you tried and you put effort on it so if you fail you'll know that you win because to did it and you finished it. You never can think that you are a failure if you didn't win, you can see that you are good in some other things where other people is no good. You will always have options you can choose if you want to tried hard or if you don't.

To conclude I am strongly agree that failure plays in the pursuit of success because nobody is perfect and if someone wants to be perfect then they'll need alot of work, we also know that even famous people have fail so if they have fail we should fail too beause then we will see what we had done wrong and we can fix it, and also even when it means that you need to leave that people that you love behind. Furthermore even though sometimes it takes a little too long to notified how much we have success and because we don't see that, we're mad with our lifes, we think that if we don't have a good possition at our work is because were not good enough but it is not truth because they are some people that doesn't have work or some others supplies and were complaining about our possition at work. It is not fair to have that kind of mind because we all should be happy with what we have and with what we can affort. Furthermore been a failure doesn't mean that you don't know how to do something or that you can not win. Been a failure means that for more that you fail the better you get and the more capacity you'll have later.       "
676,343A80DD6FB3,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others.

People can checkout books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives?

Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty.

Especially when phones are advancing in the next years.

One day, technology will take over the human population.

Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media,

but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc.

They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but there's rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully you'll be there too.

Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone,

but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it?

Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face. Honestly everyone who does this, should just atleast try it and see what's more than life, then just being on the phone most of the day.

Once the day comes everyone will just destroy their own phone to prevent from robot abomination.

Sticking together as one, we can stop phone users and type of electronic device to end this obsession once and for all. Opening up to someone, its like a flower is about to blossum. Seeing that special someone is a delight!

Through peoples lives this is a negative thing toward human lives. Knowing that someday we will come together as human beings and sttle this like us!"
144,0AFEC3CC53B5,"yes is good idea, because they know what they want in the future.

And they can choose good career for they life. And they can preparation they can go to wall University. When they will be adult they have experience when they get job and they get own money they will be ready but you can help you family and if you have girlfriend you can help to became they help you to when you was little boy your parents away they told you what do you need to do at you life they was good example, for you no said no because you no that

In some societies ,students can brace for the future when they want a family they are ready for change and they can get Bette life. and you can start the future they can choose some work because if you study you can get more opportunity and you can will be good person en your life a person ready for start some wort nobody said nothing because you are ready for the job and you can will be a boss in you work but, you need to study and focus in you career because you need good grade in your school you need to have good presentation and you can get good job and you can help your family and friend .

Many people can not comply they goals. because they not ready and they can not find good job because they not ready before when they had the opportunity they not appreciate the opportunity and is to late for start agent. but you can start with your life in other something like work in contrition , drive truck ,or cashier bank and whatever work do you like.

For example you can study, hard because when you will be adult your are ready for your responsibility' and you can get good job maybe in a office, the point is you can have better life and you can get, all you want in your future but,your parents can help you in this situation because they can sea go your, school study hard because when you ready you can choose your life but you can not say my parents not help me about my future.

my recommendation is you prepare and study,hard for your goals because you can get good life and you are ready for start your goals. but if you study you will be the best person in the planet you can will be good example: for you sons' and they will be very happy about they father. When they will be adult they have good example and they try to did good job for they life bacuese they have good reflection before the they was born. yourself will be the best in the planet you need to think in yourself because you need to no what will be your life and you prepare and study work hard away remember you are good person and nobody can destroy yourself                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "
2819,CDABA09822C7,"I my opinion the Minister Winston Churchill its right, because to learn something you need to see it not just of the success fool side. You need to learn of the mistakes too.

The problem of someone how never has experimented the failure, is that when this happen its going to be more pain fool that someone how has that experience.

Imagine a pro football player and he never in hes life lost, and for the first time in his career lose: he is going to suffer more and maybe get in depression because he never experiment the feeling of lose. But the football player how has hes loses and didnt stop and keep fighting if he lose now he know what is the feeling, he is more prepared.

You need to feel what is loss, its going to make you a more prepared person, who knows what you want and how to do it, but you cant surrender you need to all ways keep going; is your life, your goals, your decisions and no one cant stop you."

I never got the chance to get the shoes I wanted or the clothes so other kids who were on the football team would bully me. But little did they know i was the nicest and honest kid at

In the year 2015 throughout 2018 I was someone I really wasn't. I was in the streets doing the opposite of what my mother showed me. Robbing people, fighting, breaking curfew, breaking into peoples cars. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids.

By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front. Even my moms friends would judge me on my looks just because I have tattoos and have a mean mugging face. I may have a bad background but that was me trying to be somebody im not, I was trying to fit in with the bullies, wiith the kids who used to bully me.

Moral of the story is don't let nobody get to you and make you into something your not. I wish I could go back and prevent myself into being someone whom im not. My uncle got caught smuggling narcotics and is praying everyday he gets out. This all happened because he was trying to be someone he wasn't.

3727,F8776FDF7DC0,"Have you ever thought about what to bring on a trip to the park? I've, it's frustrating to pack an activity that everyone is going to like. There are multiple ways to have fun at parks for example, you can play soccer, explore the park, and play football with your friends and family.

First of all, when you're at a park you most likely want to have a good time with your family and friends. Soccer is a good way to relax. You may ask "" Why is soccer a good activity to relax?"" well, when you're playing soccer you can get your mind off things. It helps you think more on the game then what else is going on out side of the field. Also soccer is a good way to communicate with one another.

Second of all, you can play a game of football. Football is also a good way to communicate with one another. For example, in football if we want to win we have to have a good game plan. So, we have to gather our opinion and thoughts to make the right plan. Football is a good way to bring everyone together to communicate.

Third of all,

you don't always have to play a sport to have fun. You can go explore around the park. For example, you can go walk around, look at the beautiful trees and flowers, and go hiking. While you are also there you can take beautiful pictures!

To sum up, there are multiple activities you can do at the park. Think about other activities that you can do with your family and friends. There are many more than those three for sure. You also have to think about others too and what they want to do. Therefore, there are many other enjoyable activities out there. "
3596,F2B390040C12,"My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages.

First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school.

second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, i work 27 hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students don't work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study.

Third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear.

In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day. Obviously, it's probable that students feel more easy in this way, for making their homework with time, wisdom, and decoration. Finally,the school will make the change for a good reason."
2560,BE3784039C72,"Small acts of kindness has an impact because it can help you out, they can believe in you, and you guys can play sports with each other.

It can help you out on your education and other things. For example, you went outside and saw an old man on a sidewalk and you helped him walk across the road thats means you are showing him respect. I has a day where I saw a homeless man at a store and I had to give him $5 dollars because he was a nice man, plus he gave me respect. After that day I went to the store to see if he was still there, since he was so generous . When I was him I was shocked that what was he wearing. He has like a $10 dollar cloths on and he told me how to get an education from his buddy that is rich.

They can believe in you what you say. For example, you gave your mom respect and honor her a prize for being a careful mom, she will believe in you that you can do the SOL test excellently. People believe in you when you dont lie a lot. I lied to my dad once and he still believed me buy when I lie twice and he figures it out, I'll get an punishment. Some people doesn't care because they don't understand what are they talking about like sports or something.

You guys can play sports with each other. For example, there was 2 people in a park and they saw each other and both of there favorite color is blue and they became best friends and played sports that they each liked. I has a friend when I didn't know before also he was very athletic, he was the same kind as me but i'm not really a athletic person. I talked to him and said hi, ""he said"" hi back so normally. I told him can I play and he said sure and after that we became good friends.

It can help you out, they can believe in you, and you guys can play sports with each other so thats why small acts of kindness has an impact."
2231,A6AECACCFAA8,"A problem can be good or bad. you can learn from the problem that you made. Sometimes you can't learn from the problem you did. I can agree and disagree with this statement. Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it.

You can choose what your problem's are. You don't need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from what's good and bad. If you do something that's wrong it's ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you can't do about it.

People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some don't. The ones who take the wrong path will go though a lot trouble. They would have a lot of problem's that they can't change but just cause you that path doesn't mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesn't mean their not going though some problems because everyone does.

So what I think it's trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem that's is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you mest up doesn't mean you are bad. Learn from the problem you did and grow up as you learn form it. Want to be the best you will have to learn whats the best from your mistake's."

1878,8DA298718DD7,Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace. Student's dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Student's come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. It will save a lot of time for the student's and teacher's because they wouldn't have to be there the whole day at school. It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day. 
1818,890FAF6F82FC,"I agree with this statement because it's impossible to change this impressions. Some people have physical problem it's impossible to change. Lot's of people have mental problem with getting mad. If somebody have mental problem maybe they fight with someone. They have to go to hospital to check up. If they take some medicine maybe they get better. When they have physical problem they yelling on the street and running and lot's of people scared from them. They family have to keep them at home. If they didn't safe at home.

There family can take them to lunatic asylum because they can't stay at home they go out and did something to the people. People can call to Police and maybe police arrest them then they get trouble from police. There parent should protect them from this disaster. If they want to go out there parent go with them because it's safety for them. For parent this condition is distress. This condition of doing something badly for parent. If this kind of condition they have they do care for children.

They have frustration about children because this condition is very badly. They can't go outside they stay all the time at home. If parent go out maybe child go outside and again he/she did something badly in public. If they want to walk outside by them self they can't because they have to go with parent. Some parent they take them children into park they want to play but reason is there is lot's of kids playing. If he/she did something to kids is very bad situation. This mental problem very bedly.      "
1621,7B2B2910BB90,"Imagine you are going to buy some new shoes but you don't know if you should get them. So then you ask for some advice from family and friends. But you still don't know what to do. So then you ask for more advice. Then at last you all ready know what to do. So you can more. I think u should ask for more help and advice. so you can pick the better choices.

You can get more info on the topic you are doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Thats how you can get some more info. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Last of all it's better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. It's all ways good to get more info on your topic because you don't ever want to do something with out any knoallige.

People can help you answer stuff faster. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. All really because everybody thinks different. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. you should other people for help.

you can help you pick the right choices. You can ask some friends or family for some help then it can help you go the right way. But if you do ask a lot of people you can probably can get confused. And maybe get mad and not finish your work. Then you will have no clue how to being aging. But all so all the opinion you got can help you a long way. Because you have gotten so much fact and options you can finish faster.

All Am saying is ask for some help and you can get the right answers and you can probably make some friends too.  "
187,0E26C20CFBBE,"Imagine being asked to teach a lesson but actually teaching it to elementary students. It would be a very helpful for the students that are struggling. I conquer with the person that is going to go and share the lesson. I am going to give you specific details and examples about the things I would do if I was he or she going to share the lesson with elementary students and why it should be important.

One way that I agree by sharing a lesson to other students is important. This can be more helpful because the other teacher before that taught the students maybe didn't explain very well and the students were probably were confused the whole time or some of them were lackadaisical. And the new teacher that is going to teach the lesson to the students probably is a better explained and a probably has good and more skills. He or she maybe been called from many different schools and different states and asking if he or she can go teach a lesson to their students but if the teacher agrees with it.

Another way I could be more helpful for the students by asking their teacher if I can see the whole students grades that are in the class and the people that are struggling and make a group lesson with them. The teacher should tell the students to write down notes when the teacher is writing them down too. The teacher should give the students homework and tell them to bring it back and check it and see if they have gotten better with the way the teacher is helping them more or not. The teacher should give a form to the students parents for the ones that are struggling and asking them permission if they want the teacher to help them more in what they are struggling more in. So the students can get their grade up and better in the SOL's.

My last thing that I would do to be more specific and very useful is to give the students tests of the things they have been struggling with and see if they have gotten more better and see if the teacher has done a good job to the students. The teacher should give meetings to the student teachers and more lessons so they don't need to call for a better teacher than them. And its better if the teachers can get taught so they can be more specific in what the students asks them. All the teachers of the elementary should all go take lessons to teach better and get quizzed like their students.

I explained why it is important to share a lesson to other students. Some of the students got better and some didn't but at least they tried and put effort in it. All my reasons should help why a teacher should share a lesson with other students. The students should be more grateful for the teacher that came and helped them out. These are all my examples I would do if I was the one sharing a lesson."
251,126555810C31,"An great author, Ralph Waldo Emerson, once wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences, I agree with Mr. Emerson. Because in order for a person to grow, that person will have to do an certen task, to help that person reach that goal or goals. There are difference things a person can grow in like: school, career, and hobbies.

In school a person learned skills to help a person in the further such as, wrighting, reading, vocabulary, history, and math etc. A person will learned, how to talk to other people, and how to act, by making friend. Also in school like, community collage, can help a person can also developing jobs skills, for further career.

Another thing you can grow in, is careers. A person can grow in their career by going up their working rank I am currently working at Searchs and I am the supervisor their. At first, I got hired as a cashier. It took me a while, but I got my way up there.

Hobbies is another thing you can grow in. People can learning and practicing skills to help them up prove their's hobbies. One of my many hobbies, is drawing. When I was six, I can only draw sticks finger. I have taken many art classes to help me develop my drawing skills. Now I can draw a human with details.

Going above in beyond, what you have mastered can help you with, learning a new skill, going up the jobs rank, or developing a skills for a hobbies."
357,1B2274161889,"I personally think that working alone is very beneficial. When I work alone I can work on my own time. I do not have to listen to anyone, I am my own boss in this situation. Also I have nothing to go over once I am done because I know I did it all myself and it was done right. Independently I can do more work. whenever I work in groups I get side tracked way more then I usually do.

Working alone has become a very common thing for me. I have always preferred to work alone. Working alone lets me work on my own pace. I can work whenever I want too. I have tried to work in groups but they always want to do the last minute type of thing, but when I work alone I do that sometimes too. but i know I got to do it all. I also don't like to keep someone if they did their part. One time I was doing a group power point and two out of four of my partners did not do their part and I ended up failing because of them.

When I work in groups I feel like I am doing all the work and my group members are just messing around and not helping me. I have had very bad experiences with groups I have failed many projects, class activates, and labs just because I would trust people on doing the work that they would get when we distributed it. Last week in oceanography my table was doing a lab and I had to do all the work because my whole table group wanted to talk to a whole different table group and not help me. My teacher would not let me work alone even after I told him about the situation. Later I told my guidance counselor and he did not do anything about it either.

Every time I have worked in a group I have been side tracked. I can never do anything with someone because i always have the urge to just talk to them and not get any work done. I have noticed this bad habit of mine for a long time now I have tried to fix it but i just can not. Working alone is a very good thin for me i am very productive when I work alone.

Working alone is very good for me. I like to do it because then I know that I did all that work for the grade I got not anyone else. I like working for stuff I do not like getting stuff ease. Whenever I work alone I mostly have good time management on all my work. I am mostly always slacking when I work with a group.                                       "
3687,F711DAD6AA51,"I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisehment"" because of Success,being yourself,and being the owner of you life.

First success is the most important thing for the sociaty because we all need great people like philantropist who help reducing povrety in the world,great inventor who creat thing tahat today we cannot live whith out it such as Car,internet,and computer. and the Evolution of Human being by creating a safe enviroment for everyone to live a long and healthy life.

Secondly being yourself is a great accomplishment because you truely the person you want to be, you are true to the people around you being showing them who you really are by acting truely without faking who you are,and you are live a meaninfull live by being yourself instead of what the world want you to be.

Thirdly being the owner of you life is really important because you can your own decide, you can decide what kind of futur you want ,and being able to make this decisision by yourself will make you life greatfull,and mostly an healthy live.

Some people will said that is worthless or is better to be told what to do,but being able to creat your Success,being yourself,and being the owner of you life is somthing really important for the development of Human life and for every individu to dicide what they want to be or what they have plan for they futur.

All this will drive a person to a great accomplishment because life is a text and every individu have a different text so being yourself in this world will always be a great accomplishment because some people a conditioner to live the live that the world gave them. "
1673,7F1E8663BAE8,"Is important to learn from other people experiences? The answer is yes, because they don't want you to do the same that they did. In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In my point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that mistake and they tell you not to do when you grow.

First, one person that had shared their experiences with me is one of my friend. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One of the experiences that he had tell me. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. t.c. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. They tell you does experiences, because they don't want you to commit the same mistake that they did in the past. In addition to, they want you to do better them what they did in their best moment of life.

Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didn't went well. Then you stop and you think what happen to that person that did the same mistake you were about to do. In conclusion, maybe when you were young you did something wrong. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it.

Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the same mistake. First, one person that have shared his experiences with me is one of my friends, he had tell plethora of experiences because he dont want me to get in trouble as he used to be when he got the same age that I have. Next, when people tell you their experiences, they want you to do better them what they did. Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life."
610,2E5A3E5FD179,"I disagree, to have one and a half hour added to our school hours. It would cause stress and angry, to students and teachers. Teachers would have to stay longer at school to grade papers. Students would get hugry and sleepy and have less tie to play.

If the school board plans to add a hour and a half hour to school, then students would try to stay home. Students would try to miss the bus and try to get sick if theirs a test or anything that seems underwhelming. Students would get low grades if theirs a lot of homework and less time to do it, they would just not try to do it. Teachers would get more paper work from students and try to make plans for the students for them to learn a easy way, so it wont make extra work for all of them. Students would have less time to practice from sports or other actives if theirs more homework and if they are failing a classes and get kick of the team if they play a sport.

Students would be starving more if they dont eat breakfast, because they dont have time. Students go to school at different times so they wake up different times as well, and dont get time to eat or make something later. Students would bring food to school and would leave trash, and its extra work for other people who have to clean it. And when school over they would have less time to have something fun to do. Students would sleep and not do home work and not do their chores or stay up to do homework or study and play games. They would have less time to eat and not have the energy to wake up and get ready for school and to stay awake at school.

Teachers would stay longer at school, to do the extra work, and miss important things that they have to attend. They should get paid more to stay longer and deal with kids. Teachers would get stress and try to deal with the kids that cause trouble and distractions in the classroom. They would get more strict and angry. Its bad for them since their getting older and it can cause some health problems and probably would retire because of that."

328,1829D6D139C2,"I believe that positive attitude is the way to be successful in life , Because is the way to connect the mind with reality . Thinking positive bring us peace , Also having a positive attitude makes yourself have good friends , And a better way too see life.

First at all when you expect the best , You must get the best , Because is the way to conncet mind with a positive attitude . The negative thoughts need to go away from our minds to move forward,

Because if we do not put this in practice , We must be stuck in dark way to live.

Secondly

Thinking positve bring us peace , For example ;

When you have leave all of your dark memories in the past . The only thing you may have will be peace and selfcontrol , Moreover People will be able to control emotions.

Thirdly having a good attitude makes yourself sorround by positive People , Because you are one of this persons who have positive attitude, And when you mix yourself with positive

People , You learn positive things from each other , Also is a better way to live life , Because you see life in a different journey them others , Because you do not only expect to good things happen , you make them happen.

Finally when you have put all of this positive thinkings into practice , you start see the results from all you have reap . Then it is when you have found the real meaning about life that is ; what ever we have done make sure we have it done well , Because if we do not , We will not be success in life.       "
781,3CACE02FBD5C,"There is a debate about if do we accomplish more if we are always doing something or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Some people think that is not necessary be always doing something. They feel that they need to have some extra time to be with their family and be a person that always is doing something will take away that time. In my opinion is more satisfactory be always doing something because the more you are busy doing good things or thinking and what you can do is a help to not get involve in horrible things or and drugs, you will have the opportunity to be able to give all your family need and deserve, and also you will have the satisfaction of be a good example for your kids and a support to the society.

The people that is involve in drugs, the people that get out to the streets to steal to can survive those people easily give up and did not try to find another way to get ahead, that people who make drugs, to sell drugs or the ones that consume drugs that people are living a dangerous life they are always hidden for the police or hidden because bad people are looking for them. They probably did not have another option or just they did not effort on doing something and all that thoughts became to do what they thought was easy.

Being a person that is active and always is making new things that person can be certain that they family will have everything. That person know that their kids will have the opportunity to go to school and get a excellent education. That person know that in the house will never be short of food, clothe and health. All that and more you and your family will have if you make the right choices and keep always doing new things or always be doing things and keep busy.

Now in our society good and hard working people is almost are scarcity because now some people the work in some countries the people doe not want to work they prefer be in their home doing nothing. But the people who is working those people are making the change for this society that people will become a example for all the kids but they will be a support a big support for the community.

There are some reasons why I think that the people that is always doing something accomplish more that the people that does not do anything. Is a complete satisfaction to know that all the you have is because yo worked for it and you work hard and like Thomas Jefferson said the determination never be end is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something. We can make a lot of things but we just have to have dedication and love what you do. "
68,051C3A22AEE0,"I think that the online or video coferencing wounld not benefit high school student because they many pros and con. pros student can work on thier own sudent can work on home cons

Not all student have a acces to the internet student cannot understand the assessment it make it not English speaker to understand student cannot benefit for attend classes from house. because take classes from home cannot improve the student educated. In the school class student are alllow to work with group and work with teacher. home school can cause distraction, worries. For Example when you're work or take exam and your family member call you to do something for her. in school they taught you many thing to learn. Online classes and school classes have similarity and different thing in common

The First different between this two classes is that online classes are classes that you take home why school classes are classes that you take in school.

The second different between this two classes is that in online class you don't learn lots of thing. but in school classes you learn of thing. This are the similarity between two classes.

The first similarity between two class is that both classes are required the second similarity between two class is that both classes are teaches by teacher  "
1190,5C656CD57F67,"Identify a talent or skill you have, and explain how you develop and use it.

Everyone has a talent and a skill. I personally think that my talent is photographing, but photographing take skills as well. Taking pictures is relaxing, fun, and cool at the same time.

Photographing is I guess not easy and hard because while taking pictures you have to find the right angle the your photo and as well you can just take your picture in your own way.

How I developed photographing is by going out and looking at intense images.

when I go out, I always think about if I should take some photos of whats there like: the River

People, and maybe other Cities as well as Nature. While taking pictures, it's really relaxing because you can feel the wind breeze on your face and you can release your stress.

For me I think that its fun because you can take pictures whatever you want, I also think that taking pictures is cool because you can see how things looks like up close how it looks like on camera.

How I use it is by releasing everything that is on my mind. I also use it for improving my skills as well. For me sometimes its a little bit hard because I need to find the right angle for the photo Im taking. My photograph skills aren't that good, but I practice everyday so I could take better images.

During my free time I go out and find some photographic things like: Insects, the Moon, and other objects, and take pictures of them.

To conclude , in my opinion I think that photographing can be your talent and your skill as well because if you like looking at intense images then you can take an intense picture too, or you can take it just for fun. Besides, maybe you can try to see how your photograph skills are too.     "
1224,5EFF1BA0FBC1,"Although the extra time would benefit students. Some people dont wanna stay after school because they are already tired from staying 7 hours at school. Because school can cause stress if you are forced to do much work.

I disagree because the school board is adding it to our day. They should add a after school program for kids who need help with homework. Because if they add it for everyone then we would get out of school late. And we would barley have time to do homework. On the other hand if they add it everyday then a lot of kids will be stressed. Because when they come back if they have homework,or projects to work on then they might stay up all night working on it and come to school the next day .And they will probably be grumpy or stressed.

My second reason is The teachers will also be tired and stressed because if we leave school first. Then that means they leave after us. Also they have to grade our papers and other stuff so adding extra time to school will not be a great idea because the teachers can turn mean from all the stress. They can sleep from being too tired and then that means we wont get to learn anything. And dont forget that the teachers have a normal life too. They have families that they want to see so if the school board adds extra time then that teachers might not see their families often because they will probably be too busy grading our work.

So i think that the school board should not add the time. Because if they do then they will mess everything up like people's sleep schedule,The time they might go somewhere. So over all i think that the time we leave school right now is good. Because people have enough time to do their work and projects,and to get enough sleep. So the time we have now is good because everything is balanced. But if they did change it then we would have to get used to changing our sleep time and doing school work."
2802,CCB5EED97986,"I do agree, attitude is energy, and without energy we are nothing.

All the time, the attitude of every single person could change radically, but that could demonstrate what kind of person who you are. Every single person who can not do their own things with attitude, is like if they're not doing it with energy.

My mom change radically her attitude when she's talking with an unknown person. My cousin is the one that teach me how to be a better person just with attitude,

because of some problem's that we have in our family, for all the things that happen in my country, and also for the death of my uncle.

I love my big brother, I want to be as him, for the things he achievement on all his life. My brother is one of the most kindness person in the world. He could talk with an angry person, and just a few minutes, he would be able to change they're mind, how can that be possible?. Its all about attitude.

It's been a while for all the moment's that I lived in my entire life. Every single night that I'm going to sleep, I think all about what I did during the whole day, and I go over to think what do I did wrong, and what do I have to change to have a awesome personality, so when people talk to me, just for the way I talk, they would know if I have a great attitude. The attitude can help people life, because when you are going to ask for a application to get an employment, if you are thinking negative things, nothing is going to be positive to you."
